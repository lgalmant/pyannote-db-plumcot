joey Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?
rachel We weren't doing anything!
joey Rach, he just saw us.
rachel Shhh.
joey But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.
rachel No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.
joey Dude, chill! Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.
rachel Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.
joey Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..
rachel We feel so terrible about this, Ross.
joey Yeah, but it did happen, so...
joey Ross?
rachel Ross? Can we just close the door?
rachel Ross, say something. Anything.
ross So you two are..?
joey_and_rachel Yeah.
ross And have you. ed?
joey No, no, no!
rachel No, no, no!
ross But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?
joey Probably.
joey No, no!
rachel Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.
ross I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?
rachel No, but you know what I mean.
ross Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. I'm fine!
joey Really?
ross Absolutely. I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.
joey Ross..
ross It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?
rachel Calm ourselves?
ross No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!
joey Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?
ross Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!!
joey I do like fajitas.
monica God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.
chandler There's a hair in my coffee.
phoebe Hey guys!
monica Hey.
phoebe Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.
chandler You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.
monica That's sweet. Drink your hair.
phoebe Hey, what's all this stuff?
monica Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.
phoebe Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!
monica That's not really how it works.
phoebe Oh, how does it work?
monica I don't know!
phoebe Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.
monica Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?
frank_jr Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.
frank_jr That's not what we talked about!!
phoebe Hey!
frank_jr Hey.
phoebe Good to see you.
frank_jr Good to see you, too.
monica Hi Frank.
frank_jr Hi, how you doin'?
monica Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!
monica Which one is which again?
frank_jr Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.
monica "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!
joey Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.
rachel Well, what would we be doing?
joey I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...
rachel Feel me up?
joey In a carriage!
joey Hey, Charlie!
rachel Hey.
charlie Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?
rachel Oh, you bet.
joey So, did you bring a little something for Ross?
charlie Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.
joey Oh. Oh, thanks.
charlie And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.
joey Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..
ross I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! Hi Joey. And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. Come, please come in. Come in.
rachel Okay, well, we brought you some wine.
ross Oh! That is so thoughtful. She's a keeper. And what did you bring me?
joey Uh, actually, that's..
ross Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!
charlie Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...
ross What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?
joey Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.
ross You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.
phoebe Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.
frank_jr Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.
phoebe Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.
frank_jr Yeah.
phoebe Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..
frank_jr I haven't slept in four years!
phoebe That's a, that's a long time.
frank_jr You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!
phoebe Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.
frank_jr Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.
phoebe What?
frank_jr No, I can't.
phoebe Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!
frank_jr Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.
phoebe What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?
monica Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.
colleen Oh, please, we're happy to help.
bill We went through the same thing when we were adopting.
chandler So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?
chandler I mean, you have a lovely home.
monica Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.
colleen Well, actually, I think this might help.
colleen It's pretty much all the information you need.
monica Oh my god!
colleen Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.
monica Thank you. I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
bill I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.
chandler That's great. Can I see the book?
chandler You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?
monica It's.. It's just so pretty and white.
colleen The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.
colleen I would have told him to do it too.
monica Can I adopt you?
chandler Hey, you must be Owen.
owen Yeah.
chandler I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.
owen You were?
chandler Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.
owen Huh?
chandler You know how to use a compass?
owen I have a badge in it.
chandler You do? That's fantastic!
owen You wanna see it?
chandler I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.
owen What?!?
chandler What?
owen I'm adopted?
chandler I got nothing.
ross The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.
rachel Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.
ross Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.
joey Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?
ross I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.
rachel No awareness.
ross We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?
ross My fajitas!!
rachel Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.
charlie Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.
charlie Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?
ross Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!
rachel Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!
ross That is gonna hurt tomorrow!
phoebe Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?
frank_jr No, of course we're not.
phoebe Insane.
frank_jr I know.
phoebe Alice would never go for it, right?
frank_jr Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.
phoebe Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?
frank_jr Huh.
phoebe Frank Jr.Jr.?
frank_jr Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.
phoebe Uh-huh.
frank_jr What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.
phoebe Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?
frank_jr Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.
phoebe Alright, so that leaves Chandler.
frank_jr Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..
phoebe Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.
frank_jr Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.
phoebe I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.
frank_jr How about tomorrow?
phoebe Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.
frank_jr You'd do that for us?
phoebe Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.
frank_jr Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!
chandler Where are Bill and Colleen?
monica They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?
chandler We have to leave!!
monica Why? What did you do in the bathroom?
chandler I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.
monica Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!
colleen Hey.
bill Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.
colleen I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.
chandler But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?
owen I'm adopted?!
chandler See? Intuitive!
bill What? Where did you hear that?
owen He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
chandler Which technically now you should give back!
colleen You told him he's adopted?
chandler I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."
owen He isn't?!
chandler We have to get out of here, baby!
ross Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.
rachel Ooy.
ross And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?
rachel Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?
ross O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.
joey Dude, are you okay?
ross Totally.
rachel Ross, you don't seem okay.
ross I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.
charlie Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.
ross No!
charlie I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.
ross Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.
charlie You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?
ross Okay.
charlie Alright.
charlie God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..
rachel Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.
charlie Bye.
ross Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!
rachel You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.
ross Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.
rachel No, no, it's just that it's getting late...
ross Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.
ross I don't even know what that's for.
joey You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.
rachel Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
joey Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.
rachel Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.
joey It doesn't look good, does it?
joey Morning. Here you go.
ross Thanks. Did you stay here all night?
joey Yeah.
ross So you took off my pants and shoes?
joey No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.
ross What do you mean?
joey Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..
ross Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!
joey It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.
ross Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?
joey That's what I hear, yeah.
ross This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?
joey Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...
ross Joey.
joey I'm crazy about her.
ross And she feels the same way?
joey I think so.
ross Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.
joey Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.
ross No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?
joey No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?
ross Yeah, I'm sure.
joey And we're okay?
monica Hey, Phoebs
phoebe Hey.
monica Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.
chandler Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.
monica What?
phoebe Still, he had to find out sometime.
chandler Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?
chandler I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident.
