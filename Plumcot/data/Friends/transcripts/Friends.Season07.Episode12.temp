chandler Sorry, I just...can't sleep. Ooh! Where is that book that you are reading with the two women who were ice-skating and wearing, wearing those hats with the flowers on it? Because every time I look at that cover I'm like

joey All right well, y'know...I guess we know what we have to do to get down.
ross Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice. Help us! Please help us! We're stuck up on the roof and we can't get down!!!
joey Ross. I was thinking we could just go down the fire escape.
ross I know, I wasn't finished. But don't worry! We're gonna go down the fire escape!!
chandler Shhhhhhhhh!!! I'm sorry, I thought maybe I'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.
monica With a wok? I thought you were going to read my boring book to put you asleep.
chandler It got interesting! Damn you Oprah!
monica Here, let me make the milk, I'm up anyway.
chandler Hey, y'know what we can do? Y'know, now that we are up? We can just like talk to each other all night long, y'know like we did when we were first going out. It'd be fun!
monica Okay that does sound like fun.
chandler Okay, so how bummed were you when the second sister died huh?
monica The second sister dies?!
chandler No. No, I-I was, I was talking about the book I was reading.
monica The second sister dies in Archie and Jughead Double Digest?
chandler That's correct.
rachel You wanna go in the bedroom? It's a little more comfortable.
tag Sure.
rachel Okay. Oh wait! Umm, did you send those contracts to Milan?
tag If this is your idea of sexy talk?
rachel No seriously, y'know the contracts I gave you, did you overnight them?
tag What contracts?
rachel Okay please tell me that this is just one of your jokes that you do that I don't get.
tag Like what?
rachel Y'know, like the thing when you put the phone in your pants? Tag! I'm serious! This isn't funny! Those contracts absolutely had to go out today!
tag Rach, I'm sorry, but you didn't give me any contracts!
rachel Yes I did! And I put a little Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today," and underlined today three times and, and then I put a little heart in the corner because I didn't want to seem to bossy.
tag I'm telling you, you never gave them to me.
rachel Y'know what Tag, if we went down to the office you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.
tag No, I would see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk!
rachel Or maybe you would see me looking embarrassed because you are talking on the phone with your crotch!
tag You wanna go down to the office right now?
rachel No! Come on its late, we're not gonna go down to the office.
tag Okay I understand. I wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.
rachel Okay get your coat! Oh! When did you unhook this? Nice work!
joey All right, it won't go down any further. It's stuck.
ross Ugh. Well, we're just gonna have to jump. Yeah. Now, we're gonna have to make sure to land to the right of that patch of ice, okay? Not hit the dumpster on the other side and uh, and try to avoid that-that weird brownish red stuff in the middle. So, when you get down there...you go up to the roof and you let me in.
joey Oh whoa-whoa wait a minute! I have to do it?!
ross Yeah! Oh yeah, you'll be fine! It-it'll be uh, just like bungy jumping. Y'know? But instead of bouncing back up you-you won't.
joey What if I smack my head on the concrete?
ross Well, I'm gonna lie to you Joey, it's a possibility.
joey I don't know Ross! I-I tell you what, let's flip to see who does it, okay? You-you call it in the air, all right?
ross Oh, all right. Tails! Can you-can you see what it is?
joey No.
ross Okay. Well, you be careful.
joey What? No! No Ross! No-no! Stop! I'm not jumping! Okay, look I have an audition tomorrow and I can't go if I break my leg.
ross Well I'm jumping! I have a son! Okay? He won't have a father if-if I die!
joey Well all right so, it looks like we're even!
phoebe Okay. So, this wire is connected to this wire which plugs into here. Okay so, to get the beeping to stop all I have to do... Well done, Pheebs. What do you want from me?!!!!!!!
monica Okay, here's your milk. What do you want to talk about?
chandler What? What? What?
monica Ohh! Ohhhh! Were you sleeping sweetie? I'm sorry. Here.
tag Okay! Feel free to look, but I'm telling you those contracts are not on this desk.
rachel Oh how can you possibly know? Look at this mess, Tag! I mean, this is what I'm talking about! You have to be organized! You've got newspapers! You've got magazines! You got-Ohh! And who is this chippy? A little young for you Tag, but whatever.
tag It's my sister.
rachel Okay, very cute braces. Anyway y'know what, the point is Tag, start looking because you are going to find those contracts on your desk.
tag So when do you imagine you gave them to me? In the morning or in the afternoon?
rachel In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner came into my office after lunch. He put them on my desk, and then I put a Post-It on it that said, "Must go out today." So you just keep looking in there! All right?
tag It's not here.
rachel Puzzler. A bit of a puzzle. Why don't you um, check the copy room, maybe you left the contracts in there?
tag How could I have left them in the copy room?
rachel I don't know Tag! How can your genitals make phone calls? Okay? It's not a perfect world! Just go please.
tag Fine.
rachel Thank you. Hello? I still don't get it.
monica Are you still awake?
chandler Yeah! You?
monica You do know that was me who just said that right? Hey. As long as we're both up
chandler Yeah? I hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.
joey Man, I'm starving! What the hell was I thinking at dinner?! "Do you want soup or salad?" Both! Always order both!
ross Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later.
joey Yeah? Really? No one's home?
ross I don't think so. Hello? When you get in there
phoebe Okay, this is where you and I part ways. Noisy bitch!
monica What?! What are you doing?!
chandler Do you know what just happened?
monica Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep.
chandler No. We were in the middle of sex...and you fell asleep.
monica Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked me world!
chandler Monica?
monica What?!
chandler I was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it. So please wake up so we can do it right!
monica Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Come on big fella!
chandler Okay.
monica Give me the good stuff.
chandler Yeah! No! No! No! Don't fall asleep! Okay, I am going to make you some coffee. And I probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.
monica Okay, I'm up! I'm up!
rachel Hi! I got you some coffee. To, uh.....fair enough. So! Do you got anything for me?
tag Still no luck.
rachel Oh my God! Did you check your entire desk! Did you check all the drawers!
tag Do you want me to check again?
rachel Well yeah, I wish that you would. Well, no it's not in there! How about that drawer?
tag Well, it's not out here. Is there any chance it could be in your office?
rachel Y'know, I don't-I don't know. Let me, let me check.
tag Any luck?
rachel Can I see you in my office for a minute?
tag Yeah? You found them!! Y'know what? I'm not even going to gloat. I'm just really relived this whole thing is over.
rachel You put these on my desk!
tag I did not!
rachel Oh really? So you're saying they just slid out of your bottom drawer, crawled across the floor, then jumped on to my desk?!
tag How did you know they were in my bottom drawer?
rachel I am so hot for you right now.
phoebe Oh my God! How did you get back here?!
a_disembodied_voice Phoebe Buffay?!
phoebe Fire alarm? Oh! Hi, officer-fireman, can-can I help you?
the_fireman We found your fire alarm in the trash chute.
phoebe That's not mine.
the_fireman Yes it is.
phoebe How do you know?
the_fireman The next time you want to dump a fire alarm in a trash chute, don't wrap it in a blanket that says, "Property of Phoebe Buffay not Monica."
phoebe Okay do you-Okay, do you have a search warrant? Because the last time I checked this was still America!
the_fireman Please reattach this, it's against the law to disconnect them.
phoebe Fine! But please God; tell me how to stop them from going off!
the_fireman There's a reset button under the plastic cover.
phoebe There's a reset button?! Ugh, thank you! Thank you! There's a reset button! My God! Why didn't I see that! Reset button, reset button, where is there a reset button? Oh here it is! Oh! Ohh, God!
ross Okay, do-do you have a good grip?
joey Yeah!
ross Okay, I'm going to start climb down you now.
joey All right! Just hurry up!
ross Okay. Now-now-now should I climb down your front so we're face to face or-or should I climb down your back so we're-we're butt to face.
joey I think face to face.
ross I would say that.
joey Face to face, yeah!
ross Okay, here I go.
joey All right.
joey Oh my... How much do you weigh Ross?!
ross I prefer not to answer that right now, I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.
joey Y'know, when we talked about face to face, I don't think we thought it all the way through.
ross So what do you want me to do?
joey Well, just shimmy down me and drop!
ross Hi.
joey Hi.
ross M-maybe I should hang and you can climb down me.
joey Yeah? Maybe we should talk about that for a little while!
ross It's still looks pretty far!
joey It's not that far! Just drop!
ross Do not rush me!!
joey Ross, you should know that my pants are startin' to come down and I'm not wearing any underwear!
ross Oww!! My ankle! I really hurt my ankle! I think I twisted it when I-Ooh, a quarter!
monica That really was some of your best work.
chandler Hm-hmm, I told you! I can't believe that I've only got two hours before I call in sick for work.
monica I have to be up in seven minutes.
chandler Well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes
monica Really?!
chandler Do you wanna?
monica Okay! You get the vacuum cleaner and I'll get the furniture polish!
