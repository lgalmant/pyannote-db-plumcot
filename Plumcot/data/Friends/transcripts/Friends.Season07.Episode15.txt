monica_geller I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
rachel_green Ohh
dr_ross_geller What's the matter? You okay?
rachel_green Yeah, it's just y'know
chandler_bing Monica said wedding.
monica_geller Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
rachel_green Oh! I would love to read a poem.
chandler_bing Do you think you could get through a poem?
rachel_green It'll be a short one.
monica_geller Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
rachel_green Ohhh
dr_ross_geller Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
chandler_bing Too?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
monica_geller Do you mind telling us what it is?
dr_ross_geller Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
chandler_bing Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
all@ Hey!
joey_tribbiani So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
monica_geller What is DOOL?
joey_tribbiani Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
all@ Oh!!
chandler_bing That's great!
joey_tribbiani And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
chandler_bing So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
rachel_green Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
joey_tribbiani Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
dr_ross_geller What? A brain transplant?!
joey_tribbiani Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
dr_ross_geller It's ridiculous!
joey_tribbiani Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
dr_ross_geller It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
monica_geller Who are they killing off?
joey_tribbiani Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
monica_geller@rachel_green Noo!!
monica_geller She's my favorite character on DOOL.
joey_tribbiani Nice.
rachel_green She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
monica_geller And the way she slaps all the time!
rachel_green Oh!
monica_geller Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
chandler_bing Don't do it.
rachel_green Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
joey_tribbiani Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
dr_ross_geller Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
joey_tribbiani Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
phoebe_buffay Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
rachel_green Well, I'd have to say gay.
phoebe_buffay Yeah? Why?
rachel_green Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
phoebe_buffay Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
rachel_green Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
phoebe_buffay Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
rachel_green All right, straight, and not subtle.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, he left his cell phone.
rachel_green Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
phoebe_buffay Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
rachel_green What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
phoebe_buffay Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
rachel_green What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
rachel_green Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
phoebe_buffay That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
rachel_green Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
phoebe_buffay No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
rachel_green Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
phoebe_buffay Nice try.
rachel_green Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
phoebe_buffay I don't know.
rachel_green Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
phoebe_buffay Ah-ha! Too cocky!
dina I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
jessica_lockhart Oh yes there is!
dina What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
jessica_lockhart That was an accident! And so were you.
dina Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
jessica_lockhart Oh, my baby!
the_director#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Cut!
joey_tribbiani That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Oh, just years of experience.
dina Can I get some ice here?!
joey_tribbiani Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 You're not the fan who's dying are you?
joey_tribbiani Say what?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
joey_tribbiani No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Oh that was a real person?!
joey_tribbiani An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I-I-I'm leaving the show?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Who told you that?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, one of the writers.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
joey_tribbiani Umm
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years-I'll give you a tip!
joey_tribbiani Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
rachel_green No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
phoebe_buffay Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
rachel_green I don't think so.
phoebe_buffay Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
rachel_green All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
rachel_green Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
phoebe_buffay Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
rachel_green Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
phoebe_buffay Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
rachel_green Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
phoebe_buffay So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
rachel_green His new girlfriend!
monica_geller What is that?
chandler_bing I think it's the dying cat parade.
monica_geller It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
monica_geller Nooo!!
chandler_bing Yes!!
monica_geller No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
chandler_bing Why is your family Ross?!
monica_geller He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
chandler_bing If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
rachel_green Hi Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
rachel_green How are ya?
phoebe_buffay Good.
rachel_green Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, now you lost me.
rachel_green You stole the phone!
phoebe_buffay No I didn't!
rachel_green No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
phoebe_buffay No.
rachel_green Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
rachel_green Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay That is a different phone.
rachel_green Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
phoebe_buffay That is damning evidence.
rachel_green Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
phoebe_buffay Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
rachel_green Phoebe! You can't do th
phoebe_buffay Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8:30? At-at my apartment. It's umm, it's umm 5 Morton Street, Apartment 14, umm and then maybe y'know after we can grab a bite to eat or whatever. Okay, well okay I'll see you then. Bye.
rachel_green You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
phoebe_buffay Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
rachel_green You just said it!
phoebe_buffay Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just...be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
rachel_green Oh Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay What?! That's the first time today!
rachel_green Ohh!
joey_tribbiani So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to
dina I'm 16.
joey_tribbiani See you in 2003.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
joey_tribbiani I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Yeah, thanks.
joey_tribbiani No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
joey_tribbiani Joey.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
writer It wasn't my decision!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
joey_tribbiani Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
joey_tribbiani Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 You're so welcome.
joey_tribbiani Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Is that supposed to be me?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
joey_tribbiani I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
chandler_bing Well, I feel like a snack!
monica_geller Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
chandler_bing Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
dr_ross_geller What?!
chandler_bing Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by...Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
dr_ross_geller Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
monica_geller No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
dr_ross_geller Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
monica_geller You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
dr_ross_geller How did you know about that?!
chandler_bing We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
dr_ross_geller Were you the ones called the cops?!
chandler_bing That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
dr_ross_geller Why not?
chandler_bing Because we hate them.
dr_ross_geller Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
chandler_bing We have heard you play.
dr_ross_geller No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
joey_tribbiani Okay! All right!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Okay.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
joey_tribbiani Oh well-Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
joey_tribbiani Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb-Angelina Jolie!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
joey_tribbiani Like-like what?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
joey_tribbiani Wow!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 You think I'm hot?
joey_tribbiani You own the room. We should probably get-get uh
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Okay.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like
rachel_green Hey! Hey!
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Who is it?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
phoebe_buffay Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?

phoebe_buffay Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.

phoebe_buffay Wow! How long were we arguing for?

phoebe_buffay Wh-what do we do?
rachel_green I don't know!
phoebe_buffay Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
rachel_green I know! What?!
phoebe_buffay Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
rachel_green No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
phoebe_buffay Rachel, listen-I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
rachel_green All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
phoebe_buffay Yeah! You're such a great friend!
rachel_green Ohh
tom So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
phoebe_buffay Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
tom Okay. Okay.
phoebe_buffay Nice!

cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Well, it's nice to know that you
rachel_green MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
joey_tribbiani That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
joey_tribbiani Sure. Yep.
monica_geller Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Certainly.
monica_geller Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
rachel_green God. You seem really, really nice.
joey_tribbiani Okay, bye-bye.
rachel_green I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
joey_tribbiani All right, here we go.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 I really can't slap you.
rachel_green You are so beautiful.
monica_geller Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
joey_tribbiani Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 What?
joey_tribbiani They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 They don't?
joey_tribbiani Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 How does it happen?
joey_tribbiani Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
joey_tribbiani Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
dr_ross_geller ...now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
rachel_green I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
dr_ross_geller Do you wanna start telling secrets?
rachel_green No!
dr_ross_geller Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
dr_ross_geller One, two, three, four!
dr_ross_geller You know the song! Sing along!
dr_ross_geller So?
chandler_bing@monica_geller No!
dina Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
fredrick Thank you sweetheart.
dina I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
joey_tribbiani I don't think so.
dina Who are you?!
jessica_lockhart What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
the_director#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
joey_tribbiani Oh noo

joey_tribbiani Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Eight months.
joey_tribbiani That's a really long time.
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
joey_tribbiani Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again-That is-I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
cecilia#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode15 That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
