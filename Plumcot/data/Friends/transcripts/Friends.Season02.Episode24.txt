rachel_green Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?
joey_tribbiani Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
all@ Who?
joey_tribbiani All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
all@ Wow!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.
chandler_bing 'Cause he was just so darn cute.
joey_tribbiani No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses.
dr_ross_geller Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it.
joey_tribbiani I did do it, I'm a professional.
monica_geller Then what's the problem?
joey_tribbiani See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother.
phoebe_buffay Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh.
chandler_bing Hey, what did your agent say?
joey_tribbiani Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me.
monica_geller What, forget it!
rachel_green Yeah, right.
joey_tribbiani Come on, I need your help here.
phoebe_buffay All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again.
joey_tribbiani You see this, this is a friend.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend.
joey_tribbiani Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
monica_geller Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that makes sense.
dr_ross_geller Over my dead body!
chandler_bing And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
dr_ross_geller Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, you look so good!
rachel_green I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
dr_ross_geller So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding.
rachel_green Because I promised Mindy I would.
monica_geller Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him.
rachel_green Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.
phoebe_buffay Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
chandler_bing I may have.
monica_geller Woo-hoo, stuud!
dr_ross_geller What's she look like?
chandler_bing Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet.
monica_geller Woo-hoo, geeek!
chandler_bing I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy...
dr_ross_geller Get out!
rachel_green Nooo!
monica_geller Please!
chandler_bing Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did.
rachel_green Wow! What's that like?
chandler_bing It's like this, me, no jokes.
phoebe_buffay All right, stop it, you're freaking me out.
dr_richard_burke Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later.
all@ Bye, Richard.
monica_geller Bye sweetie, I love you.
dr_richard_burke I love you, too.
phoebe_buffay I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like.
monica_geller What are you talking about? What wedding?
phoebe_buffay Come on, like you never talk that.
monica_geller Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'
rachel_green Afraid to ask him?
monica_geller Could not be more terrified.
chandler_bing Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum.
monica_geller Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there he is.
dr_richard_burke Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out.
monica_geller Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure.
dr_richard_burke Okay.
monica_geller Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?
dr_richard_burke Sure I do.
monica_geller Yeah, am I in it?
dr_richard_burke Honey, you are in it.
monica_geller Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky.
dr_richard_burke Oh, yeah!
monica_geller Keep talkin'.
dr_richard_burke Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast.
monica_geller Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?
dr_richard_burke Like a hound?
monica_geller Not a basset, a bassinet.
dr_richard_burke You really need the bassinet?
monica_geller Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future.
dr_richard_burke Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start.
monica_geller Uh-huh.
dr_richard_burke Look I want you, now.
monica_geller That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.
joey_tribbiani Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone.
chandler_bing Joey, no means no!
rachel_green Hey!
chandler_bing I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep.
joey_tribbiani Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon
dr_ross_geller Get away from me I said no!
monica_geller Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
joey_tribbiani Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him
all@ Bye.
phoebe_buffay Bye, good luck.
phoebe_buffay So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that
chandler_bing Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim
phoebe_buffay What does she mean by HH?
chandler_bing It means we're holding hands.
phoebe_buffay Are you the cutest?
chandler_bing I'm afraid I might just be.
phoebe_buffay You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy.
chandler_bing Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her.
phoebe_buffay It could be like a big giant guy.
joey_tribbiani Man, I got this close to him and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?
phoebe_buffay We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
joey_tribbiani Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.
chandler_bing How do you not fall down more?
phoebe_buffay Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'
chandler_bing All right. "My husband is sleeping with his secretary." She's married!
phoebe_buffay Well at least we know she's a woman.
chandler_bing I can't believe she's married.
joey_tribbiani Aw, man I'm sorry This must be very tough for ya, huh
monica_geller So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them.
dr_richard_burke Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun.
monica_geller Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about.
dr_richard_burke Neither am I.
dr_ross_geller Hey, there.
rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller Are you all right?
rachel_green Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time.
dr_ross_geller Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride.
rachel_green God I know, you're right.
wedding_planner All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you.
rachel_green Okay, I'll see you after the thing.
dr_ross_geller Okay, good luck
rachel_green Thank you, Okay, Okay.
rachel_green Why the hell didn't you tell me!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'
rachel_green Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes.
dr_ross_geller Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad.
rachel_green Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you.
mr_weinberg Rachel!
rachel_green Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg.
mr_weinberg It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much.
mrs_weinberg You told me you didn't see anything.
mr_weinberg I tell ya a lot things!
mrs_weinberg Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear.
mr_weinberg Stay well.
rachel_green Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

rachel_green Oh, hi!
mindy Oh my God, I'm married!
rachel_green I know.

rachel_green Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min.
barry_farber Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.
rachel_green Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?
mindy Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane.
rachel_green Insane!

rachel_green What?!
barry_farber Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on.
joey_tribbiani Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into
phoebe_buffay Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?
chandler_bing What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
phoebe_buffay Oh, my.
chandler_bing What?
phoebe_buffay She wants to meet you in person.
chandler_bing Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband.
phoebe_buffay What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip.
chandler_bing Okay, I'll do it!
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first. No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much.
monica_geller Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will.
dr_richard_burke Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry.
monica_geller You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do.
best_man#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode24 Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel...
all@ What?!
best_man#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode24 What, you hired the same band I can't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel...
rachel_green What.
best_man#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode24 No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out!
dr_ross_geller Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that...
rachel_green Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?
dr_ross_geller Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend.
rachel_green Oh dear God.
dr_ross_geller Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers.
rachel_green She you in the parking lot.
dr_ross_geller No, Rach!
barry_farber And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
rachel_green Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least 'one' of your weddings See now, tonight, all I

monica_geller You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'
