dr_ross_geller Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.

dr_ross_geller Oh, mine's December...
gunther Yeah, whatever.
chandler_bing Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
monica_geller Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
chandler_bing I could die.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
rachel_green Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
chandler_bing I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
phoebe_buffay But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
chandler_bing All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
monica_geller Just be yourself. But, not too much.
chandler_bing Wish me luck.
dr_ross_geller Good luck!
chandler_bing Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
kathy No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
chandler_bing Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
kathy With a K.
chandler_bing Oh-oh-hey!
kathy Wow! You are really good at this.
chandler_bing Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
kathy I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
chandler_bing Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
joey_tribbiani Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
phoebe_buffay Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
chandler_bing Hi!
kathy Hi.
chandler_bing Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
kathy I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
chandler_bing Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
kathy You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
chandler_bing Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
kathy Oh please!
chandler_bing So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
kathy Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
chandler_bing That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
kathy Oh-oh-oh-oh!
chandler_bing Is it on?
kathy No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
chandler_bing Hey!
kathy Oh my God!
chandler_bing Oh! It's on! It's on!
chandler_bing There we go little fella.
kathy What about the duck?
chandler_bing Well the duck can swim.
kathy Oh, jeez.
phoebe_buffay My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
all@ Way to go, Phoebe!
monica_geller That cold makes you sound so great.
phoebe_buffay It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
joey_tribbiani Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
all@ Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
kathy No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
rachel_green Well, have fun!
kathy Okay.
phoebe_buffay Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
monica_geller Y'know what, I like Kathy.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
rachel_green Yeah, she's...
chandler_bing She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
rachel_green You love her.
chandler_bing No, I don't.
phoebe_buffay Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
dr_ross_geller Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
chandler_bing Thank you, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
chandler_bing All right.
all@ Ohh!
chandler_bing All right.
monica_geller Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
phoebe_buffay So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
monica_geller Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
dr_ross_geller So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
monica_geller Rachel's not here.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
monica_geller How's it going with her?
dr_ross_geller Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
rachel_green Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
monica_geller Hi, Josh.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
josh Dudes.
monica_geller So, did you play in college?
josh Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
rachel_green Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
josh Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
rachel_green Okay. I'll miss you.
josh Dope!
phoebe_buffay Wow, cute one!
monica_geller Very!
rachel_green I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
dr_ross_geller Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
rachel_green Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
dr_ross_geller Oh!
rachel_green What was that?
dr_ross_geller Monica knows.
monica_geller It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
amanda Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
amanda Hi Ben!
dr_ross_geller Wow! You-you look great!
amanda Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Okay! Hey Tommy.
amanda I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
dr_ross_geller Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
amanda Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
dr_ross_geller What?
amanda I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
dr_ross_geller I-I-I...
amanda Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
dr_ross_geller Who wants to make some long distance calls?
chandler_bing Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
kathy Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
chandler_bing Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
kathy Hey!
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
dr_ross_geller Her date tipped me ten dollars.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
monica_geller Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
chandler_bing Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
phoebe_buffay What?!
dr_ross_geller Are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
chandler_bing I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
monica_geller Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
phoebe_buffay You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
kathy We were just talking about you.
chandler_bing Really?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
chandler_bing Right in there!
chandler_bing 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
chandler_bing Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
joey_tribbiani It's 4:30.
chandler_bing Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
joey_tribbiani Okay, I see what's going on here.
chandler_bing You-you do?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
chandler_bing You got me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
chandler_bing Yeah. Right.
joey_tribbiani Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Ross isn't here.
rachel_green Oh. Stop it!
josh So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
rachel_green Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
monica_geller What?
rachel_green I think he's stealing from me.
monica_geller Why?
rachel_green Because he's stealing from me!
phoebe_buffay Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
rachel_green Ughh!
phoebe_buffay Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
monica_geller Thank you so much Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Sure.
monica_geller What are you doing with those?!
phoebe_buffay But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
monica_geller Sorry, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay It's okay. How's the soup?
monica_geller Umm.
monica_geller Ohhhh!! Gross!!
kathy Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
joey_tribbiani Is she great or what?
kathy So? Huh? What do you think?
chandler_bing Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
kathy Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
chandler_bing Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
kathy Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
chandler_bing Uhh, no-no thanks.
kathy Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
chandler_bing Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
joey_tribbiani I'll be right back. What was that?
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
chandler_bing Hey, look, what do you want from me?
joey_tribbiani I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
chandler_bing I am pretending.
joey_tribbiani Well then, do it better!
chandler_bing Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
joey_tribbiani Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
dr_ross_geller Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
monica_geller No, sorry.
rachel_green Well where's Amanda?
monica_geller Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
rachel_green I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
monica_geller Ross, cough drops, please?
dr_ross_geller At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
rachel_green Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
dr_ross_geller You see Amanda and I have a very special...
monica_geller You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
rachel_green Ohh, that is soo sad.
monica_geller And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
rachel_green Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
monica_geller That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
dr_ross_geller Fine.
rachel_green Sorry.
dr_ross_geller Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
rachel_green Y'know...
phoebe_buffay Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
gunther I like it.
phoebe_buffay Gunther, kiss me.
gunther What?
joey_tribbiani Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
chandler_bing Can I sleep on your couch?
phoebe_buffay And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
gunther Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah.
gunther I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
rachel_green No!
gunther Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
rachel_green Okay.
gunther So umm, are we cool?
rachel_green Okay.
gunther I knew you'd understand.
