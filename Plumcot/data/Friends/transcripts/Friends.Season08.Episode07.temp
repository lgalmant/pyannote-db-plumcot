monica Hey.
chandler Hey.
monica Oh my God! You cleaned! Look at these floors! You did the windows! Oh, I have been begging you for months and you did! You cleaned! And nagging works!
chandler Y'know uh, I didn't actually do this.
monica Oh no, was I cleaning in my sleep again?
chandler No, it wasn't you.
monica Well then who?
chandler I got a maid. Yay!
monica I hope by maid you mean mistress, because if some other woman was here cleaning then
chandler Uh honey, I know you don't like to relinquish control
monica Oh, relinquish is just a fancy word for lose!
chandler Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.
monica Did she really say that?
chandler Yes, I distinctly remember 'cause I thought it was a joke. Now just give her a chance, okay?
monica Fine, I can do it. Whew.
chandler What's the matter?
monica Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!
phoebe Who's cell phone is that? It's just so annoying; everywhere you go.
ross I think it's coming from your bag.
phoebe I never get calls!! Hello?
eric Hi, it's Eric. From the Halloween party, Ursula's fiancáe.
phoebe Oh my God Eric hi! Wait, how'd you get this number?
eric Oh, I have a friend who's a cop and he got it for me.
phoebe Wow! What an incredible violation-and wonderful surprise.
eric Uh listen, I just-I thought you should know I broke up with Ursula.
phoebe Oh you did? He did it! He did it!
rachel Wow! What did he do?
phoebe Shhh! I'm talking.
eric Anyway, I was wondering if, you were the sort of person who...eats lunch.
phoebe Are you asking me out? 'Cause it would be kinda weird since you just broke up with my sister.
eric Yeah uh...okay. I'm-I'm sorry. Bye.
phoebe No! Wait! I was just saying that so you'd think I was a good person. Fight for me.
eric Uhh, I won't take no for an answer.
phoebe Not great, but we can work on it at lunch. Okay, I can be at your apartment in two hours.
eric Great! But wh-wh-How do you know where I live?
phoebe I've got friends too. Okay, bye.
eric Bye.
phoebe Oh my God! I'm going out with Eric! Ooh, this day is really gonna be so much better than I thought it was gonna be. Oh Ross, I can't make lunch.
ross So apparently I'm available for lunch.
rachel I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.
ross You're moving?
rachel Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, "How you doin'?"
ross So does-does Joey know you're moving?
rachel Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.
ross That's not really porn.
rachel Not so much.
ross Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.
rachel Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?
ross Well I don't know, but how-how great would that be huh? You living in my building. I could help take care of the baby. I can come over whenever I want. With your permission.
rachel Yeah that would really be great.
ross Yeah.
rachel Well can we see it?! Oh maybe we shouldn't. I mean if she just died this morning out of respect.
ross Yeah. No. No you're right.
rachel Shall we?
ross Yeah.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter Yes?
ross Hi. I'm Ross Geller. I live in the building.
rachel And I'm Rachel, an admirer of the building.
ross I-I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing away and I'm so sorry for your loss.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter She didn't pass.
ross What?
mrs_verhoevens_daughter My mother's still alive.
ross Oh, thank God!
mrs_verhoevens_daughter It looked like we were gonna lose her this morning, but she's a tough old bird.
rachel Ahh.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter Are you close with her?
ross Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter You speak Dutch? Zeer vereerd een vriend van mijn moeder te ontmoeten.
ross Y'know I would it's just painful.
rachel So she's really not dead.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter No, she's hanging in there.
rachel Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?
brenda Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible! Where'd you get it?
monica Oh well umm, I make it myself! It's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. And now the secret ingredient is...y'know what? We just met.
brenda Okay. Uhh, I'm gonna go get the clothes from the laundry room now. And, when I come back I'll clean behind the refrigerator.
monica I love her.
brenda I'll be back in a minute.
monica Okay.
chandler See? I told you.
monica She stole my jeans!
chandler What?
monica I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!
chandler So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?
monica Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!
chandler She must've been planning this for years!
monica I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!
chandler Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?
monica I guess.
chandler So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?
monica Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.
chandler Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?
monica Yeah!
phoebe Hi!
eric Come in, I'm so glad you're here.
phoebe Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.
eric Sorry, I just saw Ursula. I had to give the engagement ring back.
phoebe Oh.
eric Just seeing her brought it all back. All the lies, the way she used me. I just...I got so angry just looking at her......face.
phoebe Yeah. Yeah.
eric I'm sorry. I just...when I look at you I see her. When I see her I get a little bit angry.
phoebe Maybe this is too weird.
eric No wait! There's only a problem when I look at you. Oh I got it! I got it.
phoebe No don't tear out your eyes!!
eric I was just, I was just gonna take out my lenses.
phoebe Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?
eric Not really. You...you're blurry, but you still look like Ursula. You're Blursula. Okay wait. Maybe...If I-if I just don't look at you for a while. See? It...it works. I'm not, I'm not angry at all anymore! This is a great date!
phoebe Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.
ross Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.
gunther Jij spreekt Nederlands? Dat is te gek. Heb je familie daar?
ross Yeah, we're done.
gunther Ezel.
ross Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?
joey Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?
ross Really?!
joey No. But I got Knicks tickets for you, me, and Chandler.
ross Sweet!
joey All right, well finish your coffee; let's go.
ross Okay I-I just have to stop by my place first.
joey To tape the game? You do this every time Ross, you're not gonna be on TV!
ross No-no, I-I have to see if this apartment became available.
joey Oh, you're switching apartments?
ross It's not for me, it's for Rachel.
joey But Rachel has an apartment.
ross Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.
joey She is?
ross Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?
joey I guess I didn't really think about it.
ross Ezel! Hey Gunther! You're an ezel!
gunther Jij hebt seks met ezels.
ross Damnit!
monica Nice jeans!
brenda Oh thanks! I like your top.
monica Oh. You're not gettin' it.
brenda What happened?!
monica Oh, I fell asleep.
brenda I was thinking about taking my lunch break.
monica Oh, will you do the top of the cabinets? That'll really work up your appetite for lunch.
brenda All right.
monica Hello.
brenda What's going on?!
monica I'm sorry. I've never had a maid before, is this not okay?
rachel Hey!
joey Hey!
rachel How was the game?
joey Oh, okay. I...I ate way too much.
rachel Oh.
joey Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.
rachel Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.
joey I was kinda hoping you'd stay.
rachel Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.
joey No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?
rachel Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.
joey I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.
rachel Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.
joey I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.
rachel I know.
joey Y'know I blame Ross for this.
rachel I do too a little bit.
joey I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.
phoebe Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.
eric Oh no, stay here we'll keep doing this. I'll pay you.
phoebe No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.
eric Absolutely. I love the way you kiss.
phoebe Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.
chandler Hi!
monica Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.
chandler How come?
monica Because I put my head between her legs.
chandler To see her pants?
monica They're my pants!
chandler Are you sure? Did you see the stain?
monica No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.
chandler God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?
monica Fine. She's wearing my bra!
chandler Oh dear God!
monica My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!
chandler And yet you don't recognize that you're crazy.
monica Here's the plan! Okay? I'm going to leave you get a look at Brenda's bra!
chandler Here's another plan...No!
monica I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!
chandler Why?
monica Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!
chandler I fear a jury will see it the same way!
monica Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!
chandler You see that?
monica Do you see this?
chandler All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!
monica Yes! Absolutely. Okay? Look, you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacey part, there's a very noticeable rip.
chandler You need new clothes.
ross Hi. How is she?
mrs_verhoevens_daughter It's not looking good.
ross Oh. Oh. Well I uh, I brought her some bloemen.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter That's so sweet. Would you like to come in and say good-bye? I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.
ross Oh I don't know that it would.
mrs_verhoevens_daughter Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
ross All right then.
phoebe Hey!
eric Welcome back!
phoebe Hey! Can we pick up where we left off?
eric I don't know, I'm still pretty tired out from this afternoon.
phoebe Why?
eric Uh, the sex.
phoebe What sex?
eric Our sex.
phoebe We didn't have sex.
eric Well if I didn't have sex with you, I had sex with someone that looked an awful lot like
phoebe Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew! Ew!
eric Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! No! No! No!
phoebe You-you...you had sex with Ursula?!
eric Uh, a little bit. She-she-she walked in and I thought she was you and I kissed her and
phoebe You didn't notice she was wearing different clothes?!
eric Well I was just so excited to see you.
phoebe Oh. Ew! Ew! Ew! Ugh! Y'know what? This is too weird.
eric No-no it's not! I don't want to lose you! It's-it's like I was saying to Ursula when I was making love to her and I thought she was you-Yeah it is too weird.
phoebe So I guess this is it.
eric Yeah. Maybe it's for the best. You smell just like her.
phoebe Yeah, so do you.
brenda What are you doing?
chandler I'm leaning. This is where I lean.
brenda Okay. (Goes over and fluffs up the pillows on the couch.
chandler Brenda a bee!
brenda What?
chandler Yes! It's flown into your blouse and you'd better undo your buttons lest it sting you!
brenda I think I know what's going on here.
chandler You do?
brenda Look, I know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian, but it's wrong. You're married.
chandler I totally understand. Can I just see your bra?
rachel Hi!
monica Where did you get those jeans?!
rachel You gave them to me!
monica No I didn't!
rachel All right, I took them. But I figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch.
monica Oh no! Did you take my bra too?!
rachel What bra?
monica The pink one with the flowers?!
rachel You mean the one that you're wearing?
brenda I quit!
monica Sounds about right.
rachel What is this?
joey Hey! Uh, this is just to give you an idea. Okay well, we can put screens here, so that the baby has privacy, and-and-and maybe a mobile over the crib. And uh-Oh look! Here's a baby monitor , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie-talkies. Huh?
rachel You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!
joey Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?
rachel But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.
joey I'm loud!
rachel It's gonna be up all night!
joey I'm up all night!
rachel It's gonna poop!
joey Hello!
rachel What about all the women you want to bring home?
joey Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!
rachel Joey, are you sure?
joey Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.
rachel I want me to stay too.
joey Ohh!
rachel Thank you. Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
joey I know! I found it on the street.
rachel Are you serious-Really?! It's in such good condition.
joey Yeah.
rachel Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
joey I don't know.
rachel It's moving.
joey Ew.
rachel It's still--It's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
joey Ooh! Ah! Okay!
ross Well, the old lady died. And how do I know? Her dying wish was for one last kiss. But I don't care, because you got the apartment. Yes!
rachel Ewww. Yeah. Umm. I think I'm gonna stay here.
joey Isn't that great?
ross Ezels!!
