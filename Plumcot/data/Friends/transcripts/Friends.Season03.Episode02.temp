joey All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
chandler Taste it.
joey Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
chandler Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
ross Hey!
chandler Hey, mister tux!
ross Why aren't you guys dressed?
joey We have a half hour.
ross No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
joey Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
ross Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
rachel Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
ross Really.
rachel Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
ross Hi.
rachel How come you didn't come over earlier?
ross 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
joey Hey, Ross, want some cider?
ross No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
rachel Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
ross Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
rachel Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
joey Glass of fat?
joey What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
ross No! Do you wanna hear it?
joey Am I in it?
ross Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
phoebe Hello.
ross Hey!
joey Whoa!
ross Wow, hello! You look great!
phoebe Thank you! I know, though.
ross You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
phoebe Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
chandler All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
joey What?
chandler You're in my seat.
joey How is this your seat?
chandler 'Cause I was sitting there.
joey But then you left.
chandler Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
joey What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
chandler The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
joey Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there Soo...
ross You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
chandler All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
monica Hi.
monica Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
phoebe All right all ready.
monica Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
ross That's, that's funny. Change!
monica Hang on a second I just got in.
ross Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
phoebe We could not, would not want to wait.
ross Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
monica Has somebody been drinking my fat?
rachel You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
phoebe I don't know, you might be the first one.
monica Rach, did you check the machine?
rachel Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
chandler Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up.
joey All right! You can have the chair.
chandler Really!
joey Oh my, would you look at that!
phoebe "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
ross "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
rachel What?!
ross Nevermind.
monica Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
ross It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
monica What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
chandler Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
ross Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
monica Huh?
ross I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
chandler You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
phoebe Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
joey I'm so sorry.
phoebe What am I gonna do?
ross No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
phoebe Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
monica If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
phoebe Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
chandler Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
monica So, should I call him back?
chandler All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
joey Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
chandler All right!
ross Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
chandler All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
rachel Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
phoebe Hummus. I got the hummus.
rachel Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
phoebe That won't go with this dress though.
rachel No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
ross No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
rachel Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
monica I called him.
monica Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
phoebe Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
monica Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
joey Monica, how are you gonna do that?
monica I know the code to his answering machine.
ross Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
machine "You have two new messages."
joey Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
monica "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
joey Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
joey Now she sounded breezy.
monica He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
phoebe Monica, you don't know that.
monica Well, who's voice was that?
chandler Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
monica Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
ross Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
monica It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
rachel Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
ross You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
rachel Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
ross Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
chandler All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
joey Okay.
chandler What are you doing?
joey You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
chandler The cushions are the essence of the chair!
joey That's right! I'm taking the essence.
chandler Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
ross Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
rachel Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
ross Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
rachel Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
phoebe Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
rachel Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
phoebe Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
ross Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
rachel No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
chandler We used them as pillows when we went camping.
ross What?
chandler The sheep.
ross Hey, what you do on your own time...
joey Where's my underwear?!
ross Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
chandler He took my essence!
ross Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
joey Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
ross Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
joey It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
chandler Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
joey Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
chandler What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
joey Hey, opposite, is opposite!
chandler He's got nothing!
phoebe Okay, I'm ready.
phoebe Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
chandler What are you supporting?
phoebe Duh!! Christmas!
ross Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!
rachel Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
ross Just, just, just pick one!
phoebe Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
rachel Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
ross Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
rachel But I...
ross No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
rachel All right.
ross Thank you!
monica Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
ross It was, it was her voice.
chandler Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
monica Okay. That was her right?
phoebe Definitely.
monica See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
ross Yay!
phoebe I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
monica Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
chandler You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
monica Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
ross No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
monica Okay, fine.
chandler They got a phone in there, right?
phoebe Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
ross Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
rachel I'm not gonna gooo.
ross You're not going to go.
rachel No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
ross How, how, um how can you not be going?
rachel I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
ross Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
rachel Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
ross Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
rachel It's fine.
ross No, but, your-your mad.
rachel I'm not mad.
ross No.
rachel I'm just not going.
ross Your not going.
rachel Right.
ross Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
rachel Um, hum.
ross Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
rachel No.
ross No, because your not upset.
rachel Right.
ross About the yelling.
rachel Right, and the humiliating.
ross Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
rachel Um, hum.
ross We're good.
rachel Right.
ross Okay. Honey?
rachel Yes, Ross.
ross I love you.
phoebe Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
chandler Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
joey Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
chandler Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
joey Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
chandler Oooo-ooh!
joey Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
ross Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
chandler Jeez, what a baby.
joey Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
ross You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
joey You could drink the fat.
ross Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
rachel No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
ross What?
rachel I think you should drink the fat.
joey Yaaaay!
ross Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
phoebe Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
ross I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
rachel No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
ross You will?!
rachel You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
ross Well, yeah.
rachel You were gonna drink the fat.
joey Let's see what else he'll do!
ross How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
chandler Stop it. Stop it!
phoebe Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!
machine You have three new messages.
monica Not any more!

monica Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye.
machine Your outgoing message has now been changed.
monica Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!
monica "Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know." Nooo!!
phoebe How did you do that?
monica I don't know!
machine Good-bye.
monica Noooo!!!!
ross Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!
monica Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
phoebe Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself.
ross Rachel!! Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!
rachel And I still have about five seconds to spare. Okay, that was about seven seconds.
ross So we're a little late.
rachel Come on. Oh! And, uh, by the way....
