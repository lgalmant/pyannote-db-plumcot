joey_tribbiani Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
monica_geller Um-mm.
joey_tribbiani All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
dr_ross_geller Real magic does exist.
rachel_green Wow.
monica_geller Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
joey_tribbiani I can't tell you that, no.
dr_ross_geller Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
rachel_green Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
monica_geller He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
phoebe_buffay Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
monica_geller I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
monica_geller All right, be my guest.
rachel_green Good luck.
joey_tribbiani All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
all@ Oh, I got it.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired... .
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Whoa, you are very beautiful.
phoebe_buffay Oh, thank you.
chandler_bing Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
monica_geller Honey, what's the matter?
chandler_bing I just saw Janice.
all@ Oh.
chandler_bing Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
joey_tribbiani Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
chandler_bing Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
joey_tribbiani Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
dr_ross_geller Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
chandler_bing Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
monica_geller It's Joey's birthday.
chandler_bing Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
monica_geller Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
chandler_bing Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
mr_kaplan_jr How's that coffee comin,' dear?
rachel_green Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
mr_kaplan_jr I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
rachel_green I know!
mr_kaplan_jr I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
rachel_green Op.
mr_kaplan_jr Eh.
rachel_green Oh, you got me.
mr_kaplan_jr Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
rachel_green Oh, that sounds great.
mr_kaplan_jr Come on over here, sweetheart.
rachel_green Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
mr_kaplan_jr I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
rachel_green Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
monica_geller I know honey, I'm sorry.
rachel_green Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
monica_geller Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
rachel_green Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
rachel_green Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
rachel_green It's not funny, this is actually my job.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
rachel_green Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Ah, just one other thing.
rachel_green Yes?!
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
rachel_green Do you want my pickle?
gunther#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Hey guys.
monica_geller Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
phoebe_buffay Well, he's very charming.
monica_geller I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
phoebe_buffay Well, you're just gonna have to try.
monica_geller Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
joey_tribbiani Chandler!
chandler_bing Hello-dillillio!!
dr_ross_geller Oh, somebody's feeling better.
monica_geller Stick out your tongue.
chandler_bing Take off your shirt!
monica_geller Oh my!!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
chandler_bing Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
rachel_green The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
dr_ross_geller Wow!
rachel_green I know!
dr_ross_geller What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
rachel_green Uh-huh!
dr_ross_geller And he's, he's a total stranger?
rachel_green Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
dr_ross_geller Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
rachel_green What!?
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
rachel_green To be nice.
dr_ross_geller Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
joey_tribbiani No, only for sex.
dr_ross_geller Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
rachel_green I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh.
joeys_sisters#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
joey_tribbiani Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
chandler_bing Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
monica_geller How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
chandler_bing Hi Joey's sisters!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
cookie_tribbiani Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
phoebe_buffay Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
cookie_tribbiani No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
phoebe_buffay Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
sister_1#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 What 'cha doing?
chandler_bing Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
joeys_sisters#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Oh!!
chandler_bing No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
monica_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
monica_geller Isn't that great?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
monica_geller Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
dr_ross_geller That's excellent.
dr_ross_geller So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
rachel_green Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
monica_geller How ya feelin'?
chandler_bing Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
phoebe_buffay Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
all@ Woooo hoooo!!!
chandler_bing Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
phoebe_buffay Why, what happened?
chandler_bing Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
monica_geller What is the worse part?
chandler_bing I can't remember which sister.
dr_ross_geller You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
monica_geller Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
chandler_bing Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
phoebe_buffay How can you not know which one?
rachel_green I mean that's unbelievable.
monica_geller I mean, was it Gina?
dr_ross_geller Which one is Gina?
rachel_green Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
monica_geller No, no, no, that's Dina.
chandler_bing You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
phoebe_buffay We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
chandler_bing Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
monica_geller That was me.
chandler_bing Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
monica_geller That's okay.
rachel_green That's all right.
dr_ross_geller That's okay.
joey_tribbiani Can I talk to you for a second?!
dr_ross_geller Hey, Joey.
rachel_green Hey.
joey_tribbiani Come on!!
chandler_bing Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
joey_tribbiani I just got off the phone with my sister.
dr_ross_geller Ah, which, which one?
joey_tribbiani Mary-Angela.
dr_ross_geller Mary-Angela.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
monica_geller Y'know which one was she again?
joey_tribbiani Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
chandler_bing It's gotta be the first one.
joey_tribbiani Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
chandler_bing Yep, I'm in a tree.
rachel_green Did he call? Did Mark call?
monica_geller No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
rachel_green Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
monica_geller I guess they're back from their date.
rachel_green Music. Very nice.
monica_geller Oh my God!
rachel_green So, how are you?
monica_geller I am good. I finished my book.
rachel_green Oh yeah, what's it about?
monica_geller I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
rachel_green Yeah, I do.
dr_ross_geller Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
chandler_bing Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
dr_ross_geller All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
chandler_bing What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
dr_ross_geller Where in Cuba?
chandler_bing Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
joey_tribbiani Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
chandler_bing I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
joey_tribbiani You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
chandler_bing Where's Mary-Angela?
joey_tribbiani She's right in there.
joeys_sisters#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Hey, Chandler!
rachel_green I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
dr_ross_geller Bummer.
rachel_green Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
dr_ross_geller No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
monica_geller Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
dr_ross_geller But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
monica_geller Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
dr_ross_geller What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
rachel_green Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
dr_ross_geller That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
rachel_green Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
dr_ross_geller That is so made up!
rachel_green Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
monica_geller Yay!
dr_ross_geller There you go.
rachel_green He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
monica_geller Oh, that is amazing!
dr_ross_geller Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
rachel_green I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
dr_ross_geller High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
rachel_green Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
dr_ross_geller You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
monica_geller Are you crazy?!
dr_ross_geller Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
monica_geller What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
dr_ross_geller No.
monica_geller I mean don't you trust her?
dr_ross_geller Well, yeah!
monica_geller Then get over yourself! Grow up!
dr_ross_geller You grow up.
chandler_bing This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
nonna_tribbiani No! I did!
chandler_bing Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
nonna_tribbiani Of course! It's her favorite.
chandler_bing So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
nonna_tribbiani More of Grandma's teramisu.
chandler_bing Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
nonna_tribbiani That dies with me.
chandler_bing So will I.
joeys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
joeys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Just do it.
chandler_bing Will you excuse me I have to um.....
chandler_bing Hey!
joeys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
chandler_bing Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
joeys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
chandler_bing Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
joeys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
chandler_bing This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
mary_angela_tribbiani I am!
chandler_bing Oh, this is soo bad.
mary_angela_tribbiani Joey!!!
chandler_bing No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
joey_tribbiani What's goin' on?
chandler_bing You're it! Now run and hide!
mary_therese_tribbiani It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
joey_tribbiani What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
chandler_bing I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
joeys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 I say, punch him Joey.
all@ Yeah! Punch him!!
chandler_bing Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
joey_tribbiani Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
chandler_bing Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
cookie_tribbiani So what. I say, punch him.
all@ Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
joey_tribbiani No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
cookie_tribbiani I'll do it.
joey_tribbiani No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
chandler_bing Okay, absolutely!
joey_tribbiani All right.
chandler_bing You've got it.
joey_tribbiani Cookie, now you can punch him!
chandler_bing What?!
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green What are you doing here?
dr_ross_geller Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller How'd did it go?
rachel_green Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
dr_ross_geller I'm so proud of you.
rachel_green Me too!
dr_ross_geller Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
rachel_green I know.

mark_robinson Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
rachel_green Oh, I did!
mark_robinson Yes.
rachel_green Oh my God!!
dr_ross_geller Congratu!! -lations-lations.
monica_geller So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
phoebe_buffay Oh well y'know.
monica_geller Yeah, I do know.
phoebe_buffay Ick, you were eavesdropping.
rachel_green Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
dr_ross_geller Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
dr_ross_geller Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
joey_tribbiani All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
dr_ross_geller Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
phoebe_buffay Thanks you guys! Thank you.
chandler_bing Don't worry.
phoebe_buffay God, I hope they kick his ass!
rachel_green Honey, I'm sorry.
monica_geller Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode11 May I help you?
