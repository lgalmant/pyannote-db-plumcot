monica_geller Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
chandler_bing Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
monica_geller Do you really see this as a long-term thing?

phoebe_buffay Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
all@ Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
joey_tribbiani That's not what she said last night.
rachel_green See? Now, he could date her.

chandler_bing Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
monica_geller Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
chandler_bing Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
monica_geller Are you sure you're okay?
chandler_bing Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
monica_geller Ohh that's sweet!
chandler_bing Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with
monica_geller Oh my God!
chandler_bing I know, but just let me say it.
monica_geller Oh my God, Richard.
chandler_bing What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
monica_geller Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
dr_richard_burke Monica! Chandler!
chandler_bing Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
monica_geller Hey, it's good to see you!
dr_richard_burke You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
monica_geller Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
dr_richard_burke Well, my nose got lonely.
chandler_bing And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
richards_date#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode24 Hi, I'm Lisa.
chandler_bing Hi.
dr_richard_burke Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
chandler_bing Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
monica_geller Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'll sit down.
monica_geller It's good to see you
dr_richard_burke Oh. Good to see you guys.
chandler_bing Yes.
dr_richard_burke That might be fun.
rachel_green What were you thinking?!
joey_tribbiani I didn't know it was an auction!
rachel_green Wh?!
joey_tribbiani I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
rachel_green Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
joey_tribbiani I don't know! Charity?
rachel_green Ugh!
phoebe_buffay Well, just buy the damn boat!
rachel_green Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
phoebe_buffay I'm just helping the kids!
rachel_green How is you drinking helping the kids?
phoebe_buffay Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
mr_thompson Mr. Tribbiani.
joey_tribbiani Oh hi!
mr_thompson Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
joey_tribbiani Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
mr_thompson I think it was valued at 19,000
joey_tribbiani Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
rachel_green Joey! Joey, good one!
mr_thompson That's good. Very good!
joey_tribbiani So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
rachel_green Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
joey_tribbiani Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
rachel_green I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
rachel_green Not great.
monica_geller And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
dr_richard_burke And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
monica_geller So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
lisa Oh my God!
chandler_bing I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
dr_richard_burke It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
monica_geller Ohh.
chandler_bing What?!
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, you guys!!
chandler_bing Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
dr_ross_geller Who?
chandler_bing Richard!
dr_ross_geller What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
chandler_bing Oh you knew that. Good!
monica_geller I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
monica_geller Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
dr_ross_geller Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
monica_geller Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
dr_ross_geller Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
monica_geller If the school finds out you're fired.
dr_ross_geller Hmm.
monica_geller She's leaving for three months.
chandler_bing For camp!
dr_ross_geller Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and
monica_geller Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
dr_ross_geller No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
monica_geller Okay well I think...that's your answer.
dr_ross_geller I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
chandler_bing Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
joey_tribbiani Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
rachel_green Oh great!
joey_tribbiani Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay.
rachel_green Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
phoebe_buffay It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
emil_alexander#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode24 That was me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, en chante.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
mr_bowmont That's me.
joey_tribbiani Ahh, yes.
rachel_green Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
joey_tribbiani You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
rachel_green Okay. Okay.
mr_bowmont I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
rachel_green Ohh
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
rachel_green Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
mr_bowmont It's Pam.
rachel_green Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
joey_tribbiani Aw-awww!
mr_bowmont I don't think she'd like that.
rachel_green Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
joey_tribbiani Oooooh
mr_bowmont I don't think so dear.
rachel_green Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
mr_bowmont What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
joey_tribbiani No way! It's mine!!
rachel_green What?! What?!
joey_tribbiani All that stuff you just said? I want that!
rachel_green But Joey you don't have $20,000!
joey_tribbiani Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God, you're back!
phoebe_buffay Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
monica_geller Why do you want to see my hand?
phoebe_buffay I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing What did you guys just do?!
phoebe_buffay What happened?
chandler_bing Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
joey_tribbiani What?! Noooo
chandler_bing I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
joey_tribbiani We didn't ruin it!
chandler_bing Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
phoebe_buffay Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
joey_tribbiani Glove salesman!
phoebe_buffay Good one! Yeah.
chandler_bing This is terrible. What am I going to do?
phoebe_buffay Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
chandler_bing That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
chandler_bing I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
joey_tribbiani Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
monica_geller I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
joey_tribbiani That guy's still doing that?!
rachel_green Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
phoebe_buffay No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
dr_ross_geller Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
elizabeth_stevens Ross! Wait!
dr_ross_geller Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
elizabeth_stevens You suck!!
dr_ross_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller Okay, break-up's still on!
chandler_bing Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
monica_geller Hi guys!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller What are you up too?
chandler_bing Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, Big Brother.
monica_geller Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
chandler_bing Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
monica_geller Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
chandler_bing Eh
monica_geller Okay well that's good to know.
joey_tribbiani The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
waitress#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode24 Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
monica_geller Sure, I love this part!
waitress#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode24 Come on in.
dr_richard_burke Hi!
monica_geller Richard!
dr_richard_burke Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
monica_geller Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
dr_richard_burke Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
monica_geller Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
dr_richard_burke No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
monica_geller What uh-What did you-What?!
dr_richard_burke I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
monica_geller Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
dr_richard_burke Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
monica_geller Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
dr_richard_burke I know this is crazy but am I too late?
monica_geller What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
dr_richard_burke Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
monica_geller What were you doing in Africa?
dr_richard_burke Working with blind kids.
monica_geller Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
dr_richard_burke Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
monica_geller Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
dr_richard_burke You are?
monica_geller Yeah!
dr_richard_burke Why?
monica_geller Why? Because of the government.
rachel_green Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
phoebe_buffay I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
rachel_green Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
phoebe_buffay Not that often!
rachel_green No! I'm so happy for them!
phoebe_buffay Me too! So happy for them!
rachel_green I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
phoebe_buffay Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
rachel_green I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
phoebe_buffay Totally. I'm like 90/10.
rachel_green Yeah me too.
joey_tribbiani Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
rachel_green Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
monica_geller So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
chandler_bing Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
monica_geller Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
chandler_bing If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
monica_geller Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
chandler_bing Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
monica_geller Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
chandler_bing Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
monica_geller Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
chandler_bing It's okay, I got a plan.
rachel_green We're gonna find love!
phoebe_buffay Definitely!
rachel_green Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
phoebe_buffay What do you mean?
rachel_green Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
phoebe_buffay You mean a backup?
rachel_green Exactly!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah I got that.
rachel_green You do?
phoebe_buffay Hm-mmm.
rachel_green Who?
phoebe_buffay Joey.
rachel_green Joey?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green Are you serious?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I locked him years ago!
rachel_green Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
phoebe_buffay Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
rachel_green Oh, seriously?
phoebe_buffay Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were
rachel_green Charming.
phoebe_buffay Well hey, it's just a backup.
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey Monica!
monica_geller Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
joey_tribbiani This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
monica_geller Yeah, it's great.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
monica_geller I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
joey_tribbiani Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
monica_geller It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
joey_tribbiani Well, you know Chandler.
monica_geller No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
joey_tribbiani Maybe you changed?
monica_geller I didn't change!
joey_tribbiani Maybe that's the problem.
monica_geller What?!
joey_tribbiani Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
monica_geller Is that some kind of boat talk?
joey_tribbiani I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
monica_geller What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
joey_tribbiani Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
monica_geller Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
joey_tribbiani There are?
monica_geller Yeah! Richard!
joey_tribbiani R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
monica_geller That's right.
joey_tribbiani Chandler loves marriage!!
monica_geller You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
joey_tribbiani You got that from what I said?!
narrator#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode24 When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
dr_ross_geller What happened you guys?
dr_ross_geller Rach!
rachel_green Hey you!
dr_ross_geller Hey, come on in.
rachel_green Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
dr_ross_geller Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
rachel_green Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
dr_ross_geller I guess so.
rachel_green So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
dr_ross_geller Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
rachel_green Exactly.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, yeah I already have one.
rachel_green What? Who?
dr_ross_geller Phoebe.
rachel_green Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, I don't think so.
rachel_green Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
dr_ross_geller That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
joey_tribbiani Where the hell have you been?!
chandler_bing I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
joey_tribbiani Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
chandler_bing My-Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani I know! They suck!!
chandler_bing He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
joey_tribbiani I know!
chandler_bing Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
joey_tribbiani Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
chandler_bing You're right.
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
chandler_bing Okay great.
joey_tribbiani Dude-dude-dude!
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
monica_geller Hi.
dr_richard_burke Hi.
monica_geller I don't know why I'm here.
dr_richard_burke I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
monica_geller I don't know.
dr_richard_burke Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
monica_geller Chandler is such an idiot!
dr_richard_burke Drink?
monica_geller Yeah, I'll have a scotch
dr_richard_burke ...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
monica_geller Still smoking cigars?
dr_richard_burke Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
monica_geller No that's, that's okay.
dr_richard_burke So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
monica_geller Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
dr_richard_burke Oh really?
monica_geller Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
dr_richard_burke Who is it?
monica_geller Edward Nevski?
dr_richard_burke Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
monica_geller No.
dr_richard_burke Ahh.
monica_geller But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
rachel_green Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
phoebe_buffay Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
rachel_green What?!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
phoebe_buffay I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
joey_tribbiani No we weren't!
dr_ross_geller I was not!
phoebe_buffay Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
rachel_green Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
joey_tribbiani Pick me!!
dr_ross_geller No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
phoebe_buffay All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
joey_tribbiani This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
dr_ross_geller Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
phoebe_buffay No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
rachel_green Oh God, Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay I'm talking about massages.
rachel_green Oh.
rachel_green Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
joey_tribbiani Okay that's fair.
dr_ross_geller All right.
phoebe_buffay Good!
rachel_green Pick one.
phoebe_buffay Left! Thank you.
rachel_green You're welcome.
phoebe_buffay Ross!
rachel_green Joey! We should just switch.
phoebe_buffay Yeah absolutely!
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
monica_geller I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
dr_richard_burke Excuse me?
monica_geller Oh! Him.
dr_richard_burke Oh. Whew!
monica_geller I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
dr_richard_burke Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
monica_geller Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
dr_richard_burke I think that's fair.
monica_geller Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
dr_richard_burke It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
monica_geller Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm
dr_richard_burke I know.
monica_geller Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can
dr_richard_burke Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
dr_richard_burke Chandler.
chandler_bing Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
dr_richard_burke She's not here and please come in.
chandler_bing Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
dr_richard_burke Okay, she was here, but she left.
chandler_bing Well where did she go?
dr_richard_burke Well she said she had to think things over.
chandler_bing Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
dr_richard_burke Oh, hey look nothing happened.
chandler_bing Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
dr_richard_burke Well all right, one thing happened?
chandler_bing Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
dr_richard_burke Well I'm sorry.
chandler_bing And what does she have to think about? I love her!
dr_richard_burke Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
chandler_bing But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
dr_richard_burke Well if it helps, it worked very well.
chandler_bing It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
dr_richard_burke You were gonna propose?
chandler_bing Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
dr_richard_burke No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
chandler_bing Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
dr_richard_burke I know. I hate that!
joey_tribbiani Dude!
chandler_bing I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
joey_tribbiani She's gone.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
chandler_bing What are you talking about?
joey_tribbiani She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
chandler_bing Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
joey_tribbiani I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
chandler_bing Well where... Where did she go?
joey_tribbiani To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
chandler_bing I can't believe I ruined this.
joey_tribbiani I am so sorry man.
monica_geller You wanted it to be a surprise.
chandler_bing Oh my God.
monica_geller Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
chandler_bing Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
monica_geller Yes.
monica_geller I knew you were likely to take a wife!
joey_tribbiani Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
monica_geller Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
rachel_green Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
phoebe_buffay Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
monica_geller Oh
rachel_green Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
