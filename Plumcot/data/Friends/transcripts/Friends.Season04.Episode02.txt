chandler_bing You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
joey_tribbiani Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
chandler_bing All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
joey_tribbiani All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
chandler_bing Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!

monica_geller I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
dr_ross_geller I was just leaving.
rachel_green Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
dr_ross_geller Why? Did you write it?
rachel_green Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
dr_ross_geller Well ah, actually...
rachel_green I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
dr_ross_geller Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
rachel_green Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm sure.
rachel_green Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
phoebe_buffay ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
dr_ross_geller Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
chandler_bing Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
dr_ross_geller I'm reading your ad.
joey_tribbiani Looks good, uh?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
rachel_green Why? I love that thing.
chandler_bing You want it?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Oh no.
chandler_bing Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
joey_tribbiani Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
chandler_bing All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
joey_tribbiani What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
chandler_bing Nooo.
joey_tribbiani Oh. What do you do?
chandler_bing I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I actually don't know...
dr_ross_geller Good, so do I
rachel_green Something to do with numbers?
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Nothing. Nothing.
joey_tribbiani What? What's wrong?
phoebe_buffay I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
rachel_green You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
phoebe_buffay No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
dr_ross_geller Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
phoebe_buffay No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
joey_tribbiani Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
chandler_bing Let it go!!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
monica_geller Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
rachel_green Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
monica_geller What, that little thing at the prom?
rachel_green Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
monica_geller Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
rachel_green I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
monica_geller Look, you and I went to different high schools...
rachel_green Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
monica_geller You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
rachel_green They had to have that specially made?!
monica_geller It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
rachel_green Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
monica_geller Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
rachel_green Oh, you go out with him.
monica_geller Oh, really?!
rachel_green Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
monica_geller I'll try.
dr_ross_geller So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
joey_tribbiani Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
chandler_bing Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
phoebe_buffay Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
dr_ross_geller So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
monica_geller Why can't you use the phone in here?
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
dr_ross_geller So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
monica_geller Ross, don't start.
dr_ross_geller Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
rachel_green I believe it.
dr_ross_geller No you don't.
rachel_green Yes, I do.
dr_ross_geller No you do - y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
rachel_green Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
dr_ross_geller I do not always have to be - okay, okay.
rachel_green Jurassic Park could happen.
tony Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
joey_tribbiani Pretty nice?
chandler_bing You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
tony We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
chandler_bing Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
tony You gotta take the canoe!
chandler_bing All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
peter We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
joey_tribbiani Good for you!!
rachel_green You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
dr_ross_geller Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
rachel_green You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
rachel_green Do we have to tell her?
dr_ross_geller Yes, we have to tell her!
monica_geller Oh, but it's made her so happy.
dr_ross_geller Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
all@ Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
rachel_green I hate when Ross is right!
monica_geller He is right, isn't he?
chandler_bing Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
all@ You think?
chandler_bing Oh-no, he's right.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
monica_geller Hi!

chip_matthews Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
joey_tribbiani This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode02 What?!
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode02 No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode02 All right, you have yourself a deal.
joey_tribbiani Okay. See?! I told ya!
joey_tribbiani Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!

monica_geller Is that all?
chip_matthews Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
monica_geller Ohh, how is he?
chip_matthews Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.

chandler_bing What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
joey_tribbiani Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
chandler_bing So - You got in voluntarily?!
joey_tribbiani I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
chandler_bing BEND OVER?!!!
chip_matthews ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
monica_geller Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
chip_matthews You know where I work!
monica_geller I do?
chip_matthews The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
monica_geller You still work at the multiplex?
chip_matthews Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
monica_geller Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
chip_matthews Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
rachel_green Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
joey_tribbiani Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
monica_geller Oh my God! What happened?
chandler_bing Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
rachel_green So, how was your date?
monica_geller Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
rachel_green Um-hmm.
monica_geller Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
rachel_green Oh honey, I'm sorry.
monica_geller No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
rachel_green Ohh! That's so great!
monica_geller I know!
dr_ross_geller Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
chandler_bing Oh, they said uh, “You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us.”
dr_ross_geller You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Yeah? Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
rachel_green I'm sorry, sweetie.
monica_geller Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
phoebe_buffay Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
dr_ross_geller No! No! Look - Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
phoebe_buffay Ross, how many parents have you lost?
dr_ross_geller None.
phoebe_buffay Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
dr_ross_geller I don't know what to say.
rachel_green You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
phoebe_buffay I think she would like that.
dr_ross_geller Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
phoebe_buffay Thank you. We both forgive you.
rachel_green So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
chandler_bing Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
phoebe_buffay Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
rachel_green I'll go with you.
monica_geller Me too.
dr_ross_geller Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
joey_tribbiani Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
