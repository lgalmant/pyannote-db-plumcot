rachel Hi!
ross Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?
chandler Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.
ross Oh my God!
phoebe What?!
rachel What?!
ross Monday?!
joey How long do you have to go for?
chandler They said it could be up to a year.
joey A year?!
rachel Do you have to go?
monica I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing
chandler There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?
joey Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.
chandler I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.
joey We were gonna go see the Jets!
ross You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!
chandler Really?
ross Not you.
joey I can't believe you guys are moving.
phoebe I call their apartment!!!
everyone No!!! Ah!! Ahh!!!
joey Here you are
rachel Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.
ross I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.
rachel Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.
rachel Every time?
joey Uhuh.
ross Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.
rachel All right, I trust you.
ross Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...
rachel I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?
phoebe It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.
joey I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me.
phoebe Look at you all grown up.
joey Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.
phoebe You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!
joey I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?
phoebe Done. Oh good, really?
joey Yeah!
phoebe Let's see! Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.
joey Poophack...
phoebe Yeah... All right, well that rules out Lana Titweiller

chandler Hey!
monica Hey!
chandler I've got good news!
monica You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?
chandler Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.
monica It's great! How?
monica So you're gonna be gone four days a week? No.
chandler I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?
monica No. I can't be away from you for that long.
chandler Really?
monica Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.
chandler That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.
monica Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.
chandler Hey, you said that without gagging!
monica I know!
rachel Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too!
ross Who the hell was that?!
rachel Dr. Wiener.
ross Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.
rachel Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!
ross Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?
rachel Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!
ross Well, what was it?
rachel Hiccups.
ross Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.
rachel Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?
ross Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.
rachel Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!
ross Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.
rachel What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.
ross You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like!
rachel Wiener, Wiener Wiener, Wiener!!!
ross Rachel!!!
rachel Great! Now he's gonna know it was me!
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey!
phoebe So how is this for our big double date tonight?
joey Oh my God!
phoebe Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.
joey Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?
phoebe Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.
joey No.
phoebe Come on, give me something. What's his name?
joey Mike.
phoebe Mike? Okay! What's his last name?
joey Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?
phoebe All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.
joey Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!
rachel It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?
monica Excuse me?
chandler I know what she's talking about.
rachel We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.
monica Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?
rachel Ross said he died.
monica He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.
rachel Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.
monica Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.
chandler He saw a therapist?
monica Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.
rachel Why? What was it?
monica That I was going to eat him.
joey MIKE!!!
mike Yeah?
joey Okay!
mike I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.
joey Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.
mike I am Mike.
joey Atta boy!
joey Okay, look...
phoebe Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?
mike How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.
joey From school.
mike Yeah, we met in college. I mean, high school.
phoebe Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?
mike Well, I'm a lawyer.
joey Mike, 'attorney at law'!
mike Actually, I just gave up my practice.
joey What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.
mike I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.
phoebe Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...
joey Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.
mary_ellen I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.
joey No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.
monica Hey!
chandler Hey!
monica What are you doing?
chandler Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.
monica That's so sweet. Find anything?
chandler Slim Pickings.
monica Nothing, huh?
chandler No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.
monica 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.
chandler 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.
monica Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.
chandler Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.
monica Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'
rachel Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.
receptionist Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.
dr_gettleman I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.
ross Thanks doctor.
dr_gettleman Would you like a lollypop?
ross You even have to ask?! He is alive!
phoebe You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.
joey Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.
mike No, I didn't.
joey That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!
joey Please, we're trying to have a conversation.
mary_ellen Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.
mike 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!
phoebe What?!
mike What?!
joey What?!
phoebe Do you not know each other?
joey Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!
phoebe Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?
mike Six!
joey What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!
phoebe Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?
joey Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.
mike I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.
phoebe You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.
mary_ellen Hey!
phoebe Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!
joey Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!
phoebe I'm out of here
mike It was nice meeting you!
joey You're leaving too?
mary_ellen I'll stay if you can tell me my name.
joey Good night!
chandler Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.
monica You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.
chandler What?
monica So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.
chandler How far outside?
monica Manhattan.
chandler And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.
monica I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
chandler What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?
monica Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.
chandler I think you should take the job.
monica Really?
chandler Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.
monica That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!
ross Hey!
monica How was the pediatrician?
rachel Oh, I really liked him. Yeah, it was really, really, really good.
ross You promised you wouldn't say anything.
rachel I know. Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! I don't care!
monica Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?
ross He's a brilliant diagnostician!
chandler Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
rachel Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.
ross Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'
chandler Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?
ross Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!
chandler That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!
ross It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!
mike Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?
phoebe Sure.
mike I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.
phoebe Why did you go along with that?
mike Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.
phoebe That's true. Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?
mike My name in Mike, and I do play piano.
phoebe Prove it.
mike There isn't a piano here.
phoebe That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.
phoebe You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.
mike Really?
phoebe Uhuh.
mike That's great. What kind of music do you play?
phoebe Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.
mike Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...
phoebe It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.
mike Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?
phoebe Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.
joey Look at this. My two best friends!
ross Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.
receptionist The doctor will be right with you sir.
girl Mommy, I can't find Waldo.
ross With the circus? He's behind the elephant.
woman Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?
ross Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.
sally Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?
ross I am a single parent.
sally It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?
ross Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.
nurse Rossy, we're ready for you.
ross Hmm, yeah. Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.
boy Mommy
girl Mommy, what's wrong with that man?
ross Hey, I helped you find Waldo!
ross Oh good, you haven't left yet.
monica Where have you been?
ross I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.
chandler Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy.
ross Oh man.
monica Promise to call me when you land.
chandler Of course I will call you. I love you.
monica I love you too.
rachel Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.
phoebe Bye Chandler.
chandler Awww. Bye!
rachel Bye honey.
chandler What's the matter Joe?
joey I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.
chandler Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?
joey Dude, you see right thru me!!
chandler Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!
phoebe Okay, bye-bye! Good trip!
monica Chandler, wait. It goes
chandler I know.
monica I love you so much.
chandler I know that too.
chandler Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Yes it will be the same. Because I know, that's how. I promise.
cut_to Monica and Chandler's apartment.
joey Double promise? Call me when you land.
monica Can I talk now?
joey Okay, bye.
monica Joey?
joey He had to board.
