chandler_bing Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.
monica_geller I know
rachel_green Open your drapes! Open your drapes!
chandler_bing I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!
monica_geller The sun is out!
chandler_bing Hey! Remember when I had corneas?
monica_geller Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.
chandler_bing Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
rachel_green Nooo!
monica_geller Damn it!
dr_ross_geller Walls are pretty thin, guys!
dr_ross_geller Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.
rachel_green Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!
dr_ross_geller Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...
chandler_bing Not to mention the cold sores.
dr_ross_geller And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.
chandler_bing Really?
dr_ross_geller But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...
charlie_wheeler What?
joey_tribbiani He said "erectus"!
charlie_wheeler You're... you're kidding, right?
joey_tribbiani No, he really said it.
dr_ross_geller .. and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...
joey_tribbiani Erectus?
rachel_green Homo.
dr_ross_geller .. in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!
dr_ross_geller Oh, thanks guys!
dr_ross_geller Oh!
dr_ross_geller Ok... now... now we're just holding hands!
rachel_green All right! Well, uh... we're gonna hit the beach?
monica_geller Yeah!
rachel_green It was really... great!
dr_ross_geller Oh, thank you so much!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and so funny!
rachel_green Oh!
dr_ross_geller Ok!... All right, thanks! Thank you so much, you guys! Oh, I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here!
mike_hannigan You're kidding, we wouldn't have missed it!
mike_hannigan Oh... I'm back!
dr_ross_geller Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?
mike_hannigan@phoebe_buffay Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Hey! Well...?
charlie_wheeler You were incredible!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
charlie_wheeler You blew them away!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?
charlie_wheeler I was not!
dr_ross_geller No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!
charlie_wheeler Oh my God! I'm your groupie!
dr_ross_geller I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!
dr_ross_geller Look, I took it too far!
monica_geller I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!
phoebe_buffay Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!
monica_geller So, what are we gonna do today?
mike_hannigan They have a game room downstairs! Ping pong and stuff.
monica_geller Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!
chandler_bing I don't think so!
monica_geller Why not?
chandler_bing Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!
monica_geller I'm not always that bad!
chandler_bing Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?
monica_geller I punched you...?
chandler_bing And...?
monica_geller .. Phoebe...?
phoebe_buffay .. and...?
monica_geller I clunked your heads together!
charlie_wheeler Hey! There you are!
joey_tribbiani Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!
charlie_wheeler I'm sorry, I can't! I'm running a discussion group all afternoon.
joey_tribbiani Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...
charlie_wheeler You know... I feel so bad! I haven't seen you this whole trip and especially last night...
joey_tribbiani Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...
charlie_wheeler Actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun!
joey_tribbiani Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!
charlie_wheeler Yeah...
charlie_wheeler .. is it weird that it's not with each other?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! A little bit, yeah...
charlie_wheeler I think we need to talk...!
joey_tribbiani Yeah... I think we do..... about what?
monica_geller C'mon guys, it'll be fun!
phoebe_buffay All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!
monica_geller But then how do we know who wins?
phoebe_buffay Nobody wins!
monica_geller So, we're just four losers... SUPER!
chandler_bing I'm not playing with you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'm out.
mike_hannigan I'll play ya!
monica_geller OK!
phoebe_buffay Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!
chandler_bing She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!
mike_hannigan I think I will be all right! You wanna volley a bit for a serve?
monica_geller Sure! Got to!
monica_geller Aww!
mike_hannigan Oh, by the way... I'm awesome!!
chandler_bing Oh dear God, there's two of them!
mike_hannigan You're ready to play?
monica_geller Hell, yeah!
chandler_bing Did you know this about him?
phoebe_buffay No idea! I though he was soft like you!
mike_hannigan Wanna make it more interesting?
monica_geller How much were you thinking?
mike_hannigan Ten bucks a game?
monica_geller Make it fifty!
mike_hannigan I'll make it a hundred!
monica_geller One thousand...
chandler_bing OK!
mike_hannigan To see who goes first, you got a quarter?
monica_geller No... Either of you girls got a quarter?
chandler_bing Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!
phoebe_buffay Monica, you call it.
monica_geller Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!
phoebe_buffay Tails!
monica_geller Ow, what are the chances!
monica_geller Ha! My point!
mike_hannigan Oh, no! I don't think so! You know, according to standard table tennis rules if at any time a player uses his non racket bearing hand to touch the playing surface he or she forfeits the point.
phoebe_buffay He was a lawyer!
alexandra_steele#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode24 .. all these coasts having beautiful weather. In New York, it's 72 and sunny!
rachel_green Oh! Weather bitch!
rachel_green It's open! Hi, Joe!
joey_tribbiani Hey...
rachel_green What, is everything ok?
joey_tribbiani Uh... Charlie and I broke up.
rachel_green Nooooo, why?
joey_tribbiani Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.
rachel_green Oh, that's crazy!
joey_tribbiani No, it's not, we have nothing in common!
rachel_green .. yeah, it's true.
joey_tribbiani I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!
rachel_green What, hey!
joey_tribbiani Ok, Rach!
joey_tribbiani I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?
rachel_green W-What are you, what are you talking about?
joey_tribbiani Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!
rachel_green Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...
joey_tribbiani I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!
rachel_green Yeah, I'm not talking about her...
joey_tribbiani But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?
rachel_green You know? Forget it!
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?
rachel_green No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!
joey_tribbiani Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!
rachel_green Yeah, sure!
joey_tribbiani You like me?
rachel_green Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!
joey_tribbiani That's a huge thing!
rachel_green Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!
joey_tribbiani What... for how long?
rachel_green Only like a month!
joey_tribbiani A MONTH??
rachel_green What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!
joey_tribbiani I just have one question!
rachel_green Shoot!
joey_tribbiani What the hell are you doin'???
rachel_green I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...
joey_tribbiani Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!
rachel_green Who...?
joey_tribbiani CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!
rachel_green Oh yes, of course, I remember him!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, he had a paper route.
rachel_green Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!
joey_tribbiani No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!
rachel_green But can it... just... happen a little bit?
joey_tribbiani NO, NO! It can't happen at all!
rachel_green But why, why not?
joey_tribbiani Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!
rachel_green But that wasn't gonna stop you before!
joey_tribbiani I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!
rachel_green I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!
joey_tribbiani NO! No-no-no-no-no-no! Hey! Hey, we'll be fine! Li... hey, like you said: no big deal!
rachel_green It's not a big deal!
joey_tribbiani NO BIG DEAL!
rachel_green It's so not a big deal!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! I'll see ya later! Yeah!
rachel_green Ok!
rachel_green Ok, I...
rachel_green AAAHHHH!
monica_geller Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I THINK, that may have missed the table!
mike_hannigan Do you?
monica_geller Ah, yeah!
mike_hannigan Do you?
monica_geller Ah, yeaaah!
mike_hannigan DO YOU?
monica_geller AH YEAAAAH!
chandler_bing Do you really find this attractive on him?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah! Are you telling me you... you're not even... a little turned on by Monica, right now?
chandler_bing I think this is the first time in our marriage that I've felt like the more attractive one.
phoebe_buffay C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!
monica_geller Oh, damn it!
phoebe_buffay I sleep with him!
mike_hannigan Game, point!
monica_geller Don't get too cocky! Remember I won the last one! Oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?
mike_hannigan You know, you should really look in a mirror before you call yourself that.
monica_geller NO, NO, NOOO!
mike_hannigan And that's how it's done!
chandler_bing Okay-dokay, you've each won a game and I've lost what's felt like a year of my life. So everybody goes home a winner.
monica_geller Best out of three?
mike_hannigan That's what I'm thinking.
chandler_bing Should I use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?
monica_geller Serve the ball, chump!
mike_hannigan : Serve the ball, chump.
phoebe_buffay Ok Mike, better come back Mike, better come back.
professor_jarvis_oberblau I'm just saying, I have a cabin in the Adirondacks if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be just nifty!
dr_ross_geller Ooh, well. Ah, I kinda have got a lot on my plate right now, not that I wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode24 Jarvis?
professor_jarvis_oberblau Oh, you're back... this is my wife, Nancy.
dr_ross_geller Get Out!
charlie_wheeler Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?
dr_ross_geller Yes, please! So, what's going on?
charlie_wheeler Uh, well... Joey and I broke up.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, wh-what happened?
charlie_wheeler Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!
dr_ross_geller I knew that was him!
charlie_wheeler Anyway I just, uh, I think it's for the best.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you ok?
charlie_wheeler I guess. There was hum... there was another reason that I thought it was time to end it with Joey. I started to realize that I was having feelings for someone else.
paleontologist#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode24 Ok Geller. Last day of the conference, you know what happens to the keynote speaker.
dr_ross_geller Oh, professor Clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation, here.
charlie_wheeler Yeah, can you guys just throw him in the pool later?
professor_klarik Or we could throw you both in now!
dr_ross_geller Ok, gentlemen! Please! Aren't we a little old for this? I mean, we're scientists, right? We're academics. And most importantly I... you-you will have to catch us first. GO, GO, GO!
mike_hannigan Ok, so it's a tie again, 41 to 41.
chandler_bing Ok, look! Enough is enough!
monica_geller No, I have just to have two more points to beat him!
chandler_bing Monica, that was also true an hour ago! I mean, please, look at you! Your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! Ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!
monica_geller I can't just walk away! I've put in four hours!
chandler_bing But...
monica_geller Look! You knew this about me when you married me! You agreed to take me in sickness and in health. Well, this is my sickness!
chandler_bing What about the obsessive cleaning?
monica_geller That's just good sense!
monica_geller Aww!
chandler_bing You ok?
monica_geller No, no, no. Honey, I'm ok. Shake it off! Oh, no! No shaking, no shaking! Ooh! Ooh! Oh my God! I can't play!
mike_hannigan So you forfeit?
phoebe_buffay Mike wins?
monica_geller I can't believe it! I lost!
chandler_bing No, you didn't.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Because I'm gonna play for ya.
phoebe_buffay You can't do that!
mike_hannigan Oh, that's ok. I don't care which of them I beat.
phoebe_buffay Ok, we're taking that paddle home, mister.
monica_geller Honey, you don't have to do this.
chandler_bing Yes, I do. Now, I may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because I love you.
monica_geller But... you suck!
chandler_bing You're welcome, sweetheart.
chandler_bing All right Mike, let's get this over with. Sudden death. Whoever wins this point, wins.
mike_hannigan Ok!
monica_geller Oh my God! You're good!
phoebe_buffay It's like watching porn!
chandler_bing And that's... how... it's done!
monica_geller Oh my God. That was so amazing! When did you Hold on! I almost forgot loser! When did you stop sucking?
chandler_bing I never sucked, I actually didn't want you to know how good I was!
monica_geller Why?
chandler_bing I don't know.
monica_geller This is so great! Now we can enter into doubles tournaments!
chandler_bing That's why!
charlie_wheeler Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
charlie_wheeler Are they still looking for us?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. The bartender said that they split up into two search parties, the herbivores and the carnivores. You know, we as a group are not the coolest.
dr_ross_geller I don't think they saw us.
charlie_wheeler I don't think they did.
charlie_wheeler Hum, so, I started to say you something earlier, hum... There was another reason I realized it was time to end it with Joey. I kind of realized I... was starting to have feelings... for someone else.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Can I... can I ask who?
charlie_wheeler I think you know.
dr_ross_geller I think I know too but I've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry... we... we can't.
charlie_wheeler All right, all right.
dr_ross_geller I mean, you just went out with my best friend, and I just think it'd be a really really bad idea. Or-or not!
rachel_green What?
