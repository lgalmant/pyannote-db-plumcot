monica I can't believe we've never done this before! It's sooo good! So good for Monica!
chandler Oh! Look at that, time's up! My turn!
monica That was a half an hour?
chandler It's your timer.
monica Y'know, I don't like to brag about it, but I give the best massages!
chandler All right, then massage me up right nice!
chandler Ah! Ahh!! Ahh!!
monica It's so good, isn't it?
chandler It's so good I don't know what I've done to deserve it!
monica Say good-bye to sore muscles!
chandler Good-bye muscles!!
chandler I'm telling you, she gives the worst massages ever!! Okay, it was like she was torturing me for information. And I wanted to give it up I just-I didn't know what it was!
joey Chandler, if it really hurts that bad you should just tell her.
chandler Look, for the first time in my life I'm in a real relationship. Okay, I'm not gonna screw that up by y'know, telling the truth.
ross Hey.
joey Whoa, dude, look out! You almost crushed my hat!
ross Sorry.
chandler And the bunny got away.
ross This would be the place where you explain the hat.
joey Oh! Yeah, look there's this play all right? And I'm up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy. A real clothes horse. So I figure that everyone at the audition is gonna be wearing this kinda y'know, ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.
chandler And you're gonna make them all disappear.
joey Yeah, like you could find something as sophisticated as this.
chandler Done.
rachel Joey, if you wanna look good, why don't you just come down to the store? I'll help you out.
joey Great! Thanks, Rach!
rachel Sure! God, please take those off!
joey All right.
ross Hey Pheebs, how's it going?
chandler Hey.
phoebe Hey! Umm, well, only okay because I just got back from, from the hospital.
rachel What?
ross Is everything okay?
joey Are you all right?
phoebe Oh yeah, no-no-no. I'm fine. I'm okay, but umm, my Grandma sorta died.
joey Pheebs! Sorry!
phoebe It's okay, I mean she had a really incredible life. And it's not like I'm never gonna see her again, y'know she's gonna visit.
rachel Well maybe, maybe she's with us right now?
phoebe Yeah, her first day on a new spiritual plane and she's gonna come to the coffeehouse!
monica Guys! Guys! I just saw two people having sex in a car right outside.
ross Uhh, Pheebs' Grandmother just died.
monica Ohh my God, I'm so sorry.
phoebe It's okay. Actually y'know what, it's kinda cool. 'Cause it's like y'know, one life ends and another begins.
monica Not the way they're doing it. What, what happened? How did she die?
phoebe Well umm, okay we were in the market and she bent down to get some yogurt and she just never came back up again.
joey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
phoebe It was really sweet. The last thing she said to me was; "Okay dear, you go get the eggs and I'm gonna get the yogurt and we'll meet at the checkout counter." And y'know what? We will meet at the checkout counter.
rachel Okay now Joey, y'know that since you're returning all of this stuff right after the audition you're gonna have to wear underwear?
joey All right, then you'd better show me some of that too then.
rachel Okay, it's missing something. Ooh, I know! Umm, okay.
joey Really? A purse?
rachel It's not a purse! It's a shoulder bag.
joey It looks like a women's purse.
rachel No Joey, look. Trust me, all the men are wearing them in the spring catalog. Look. See look, men, carrying the bag.
joey See look, women, carrying the bag. But it is odd how a women's purse looks good on me, a man.
rachel Exactly! Unisex!
joey Maybe you need sex. I had sex a couple days ago.
rachel No! No Joey! U-N-I-sex.
joey Well, I ain't gonna say no to that.
ursula Who is it?
phoebe It's Phoebe.
ursula Oh great! Oh, you. Umm, what's up?
phoebe Umm, well I sorta have some bad news, can I come in?
ursula Umm, yeah-no thanks.
phoebe Umm, well, umm Grandma died.
ursula Wow! Didn't she die like five years ago?
phoebe No, she just died today! Okay, umm, we're having a memorial service tomorrow.
ursula Okay, I know that I went to that all ready.
phoebe No you didn't!
ursula Well, then who's been dead for five years?
phoebe Well, lots of people! Look, are you coming to memorial service or not?
ursula Umm, no. See I already thought she was dead so I kinda made my peace with it. Plus, I'm going to a concert tomorrow. So... I'd invite you, but umm, I only have two tickets left.
phoebe Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
ursula Thanks! Enjoy your funeral.
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
chandler Wow! You look just like your son Mrs. Tribbiani!
joey What? Are you referring to my man's bag? At first, I thought it just looked good, but it's practical too. Check it out! It's got compartments for all your stuff! Your wallet! Your keys! Your address book!
ross Your make-up!
rachel Joey, what are you doing with the bag? You're audition is not until tomorrow.
joey Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.
rachel Joey, y'know you get any mustard on that bag, you can't return it.
joey Why would I return it? I love this bag!
rachel All right, then you owe me $350.
joey Fine! Do you take Vasa or Mustercard?
rachel Joey
joey All right relax, look I'll pay you with the money from the acting job I am definitely gonna get thanks to you.
ross What's the part, Anti-man?
rachel Hey, don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.
joey U-N-I-sexy?
phoebe Well hello, Mrs. Penella! Thank you so much for coming! Well, okay look, here's your umm, 3-D glasses and Reverend Pong will tell you when to put them on.
rachel Hi sweetie!
ross Hey, how are you holding up?
joey Hey Pheebs, I'm so sorry.
phoebe Hey, y'know what? My Grandma had the exact same bag!
joey Here, I brought you some flowers.
phoebe Thanks!
chandler Pulling flowers out it makes the bag look a lot more masculine.
man Oops, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is this the umm, the memorial?
phoebe Yeah, welcome.
man Hello. Hello.
phoebe Umm here's your 3-D glasses.
man Oh, umm, all right.
phoebe So how did you know Francis?
man Well I actually, I-I really, I haven't seen her for years. But umm, well I-I was pretty tight with-with her and her daughter.
phoebe Really?! What's your name?
man Umm, Frank Buffay.
frank_sr Y'know what? Strike that. My name uh, actually is-is Joe. Uh, Joe umm, Hill.
phoebe You're Frank Buffay?
frank_sr Shh! No! Joe Hill!
phoebe You just said
frank_sr Y'know what, I gotta go. And thank you so much for coming.
phoebe But
phoebe Oh my God!
monica What?! What honey?
ross What happened?
phoebe That was my dad!
chandler Oh my God!
joey Hey you guys, check it out. Check it out. It's like it's coming right at me.
monica Oh, did you catch him?!
phoebe Uh-huh.
ross Wh-what did he say?!
phoebe He said, "Nice to meet you Glenda." Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?
rachel Why?! Why not?!
phoebe Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here! What do you think? He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
joey What did you say to him?
phoebe Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later.
the_pastor Could everyone please take their seats?
phoebe All right, well, I just can't think about that right now. I just wanna say good-bye to my Grandma.
rachel Okay.
monica All right, let's go say good-bye.
joey Hey! I'm off to my audition. How do I look?
rachel Ahhh, I think you look great! That bag is gonna get you that part.
chandler And a date with a man!
joey Y'know what? Make fun all you want. This is a great bag! Okay? And it's as handy as it is becoming. Now, just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong. All right? So from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that Joey, comes with a bag!
phoebe All right, I'd better go too. I have to go talk to my dad.
rachel Ooh, Pheebs, what are you gonna say? Are you gonna tell him who you are?
phoebe Umm, no, not at first 'cause I-I don't want to freak him out
ross Well, but aren't you pissed at him?! I mean this guy abandoned you! I gotta tell you if this were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger! I mean I-I-I'd walk in there and I'd be like, "Yo, dad! You and me outside right now!" I kinda scared myself.
monica Well, at least you scared someone.
phoebe Y'know it's funny, you'd think I'd be angry. I mean, you'd think I'd wanna rip his tiny little head off. Fortunately, I'm past it.
monica Phoebe, you do seem a little tense. Here, let me help you.
phoebe All right.
phoebe Oh! Get off!! Ow!! Oh, stop it!! Why?! Why are you doing that to me?!
monica What are you talking about?
phoebe As a masseuse and a human, I'm begging you, never do that to anyone!
monica I give good massages! I used to give them to Rachel all the time before she got allergic! And-and-and Chandler loves them! Watch!
phoebe He-he does not like it! He hates it! He's in pain!
monica No he's not!
chandler Yes, he is!
monica What?!
chandler I'm sorry but, ow-owww-owww!
monica You've been lying to me? I can't believe you'd do that.
ross Well, maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings.
monica But the minute we start to lie to each other... And by 'we' I mean society.
the_casting_director Any time you're ready, Joey.
joey Well, you must be new here. Why don't we get a table and I'll buy you a drink.
the_casting_director I'm sorry. Could you, could you try it without the purse?
joey Yeah, sure. Well, you must be new here. Maybe we should-I'm sorry, can I ask you something?
the_casting_director Sure. What?
joey Well, first it's not a purse.
the_casting_director Okay, anytime.
joey I mean if-if you're thinking it's a woman's bag, it's not. It's a man's bag!
the_casting_director Okayyyy! Anddd, go!
joey All right look, let me show you the catalog! See? Huh? It's the latest thing! Everyone's got one! Men! Women! Children! Everyone's carrying them!
the_casting_director Umm, do you sell these bags?
joey Noooo. No-no-no, these babies sell themselves.
the_casting_director Okay! Thank you! That was great!
joey Yeah but I didn't read anything.
the_casting_director I think we've seen enough!
joey Okay! All right, I'll see ya. We got it! We got it!
chandler Hey, is Rachel here?
monica No.
chandler Listen, I just wanted to apologize about this afternoon and the whole massage thing. Y'know? I-I really like 'em.
monica Oh, please, stop! Look, we're supposed to be honest with each other. I-I just wish you could tell me-just say, "I don't like your massages."
chandler I don't like your massages.
monica See? It's no big deal.
chandler Okay, but now see you're crying!
monica I'm not crying about that! I'm crying about something that happened at work.
chandler What?
monica My boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.
chandler It's okay, you don't have to be the best at everything.
monica Oh my God! You don't know me at all!
chandler Okay, you give the worst massages in the world.
monica I'm crying here!!
chandler Okay, hear me out. Okay? You give the best bad massages. If anybody was looking for the best bad massage and they were thinking to themselves, "Who's the best of that?" They'd have to go to you.
monica Huh. So you're saying like umm, if there was an award for the best bad massage, well who would get that?
chandler Oh, it would be you! You! Monica! And you'd get all the votes!
monica So maybe they could umm, call the award the Monica?
chandler Absolutely!
monica Okay. I suck!
chandler Yeah!
phoebe Umm, thank you for meeting with me.
frank_sr Thank you. All right.
phoebe Come, sit. Sit. Sit! Umm, all righty, before we get started I just-I need you to state for the official record that you are in fact Frank Buffay.
frank_sr Oh yes. Yes, yes, I am, uh-hmm.
phoebe Okay.
frank_sr So, what did Francis leave me?
phoebe Huh?
frank_sr Well, that's why you wanted me to come, right?
phoebe Oh yes. Yes. Yeah-no. She did. She left you umm, this lipstick.
frank_sr Oh. Huh. It's huh, well it's oh it's-ew used. Umm, cool.
phoebe Okay. I have just a few questions to ask so I'm going to get out my official forms. Okay, so, question 1) You and uh, you were married to Francis' daughter Lilly, is that correct?
frank_sr Yes, yes I was.
phoebe Okay, umm, question 2) Umm, did that marriage end A. Happily, B. Medium, or C. In the total abandonment of her and her two children?
frank_sr It really says that?!
phoebe Yeah. See?
frank_sr Well then I guess then I-I would I would have to say C.
phoebe Hmm, okay, total abandonment. Okay, reasons for abandonment, A. Top secret government work, B. Amnesia, or C. Or you're just a selfish, irresponsible bad, bad man?
frank_sr Y'know, I don't think I want the lipstick that much. But umm... Oh, would you do me a favor? And umm, would you, would you give Lilly that, please?
phoebe What?!
frank_sr Well Lilly, when you see Lilly would you give her that, that note? Because I wanted to talk to her at the memorial but, well I pictured her getting mad at me the way you got mad at me and I well, I chickened out. So, uh, I wrote her that note, would you give it to her please?
phoebe But you-you-you came to see Lilly?
frank_sr Yeah, yeah. Why?
phoebe Lilly's dead.
frank_sr She what?!
phoebe She's dead.
frank_sr Are you sure?
phoebe Well, if she isn't then cremating her was a big mistake.
frank_sr I can't believe this. I just-I can't believe this. How-how-Oh my God. How long ago?
phoebe 17 years ago.
frank_sr Oh! What about, what about the girls?
phoebe Well, Ursula is a waitress and-and she lives in Soho. And Phoebe, is on this couch.
phoebe Yep, lipstick and a daughter, big day for you!
frank_sr Phoebe, I-I-I-umm, Oops. I just, I-I-I-I don't, I don't know what to say. I just can't believe that you're my daughter, you're so pretty.
phoebe Yes. Well, that's neither here nor there.
frank_sr So would it, would it make you feel better if I said I was very, very sorry that I left?
phoebe Y'know what, it doesn't matter what you say it's not gonna make a difference anyway, so you can just go.
frank_sr All right. Well, y'know in my defense I was a lousy father.
phoebe That's a defense?
frank_sr Yes. Yes it is. I burned the formula and I put your diapers on backwards. I mean, I made up a song to sing you to sleep, but that made you cry even more!
phoebe You make up songs?
frank_sr Well no, just-just that one. But, it was stupid. Let's see, how did it, how did it go. Umm.
frank_sr I just, I y'know, I'm not very good at this. So, umm
phoebe Well, I am.
phoebe Not yet, no.
joey Hi.
all Hey!
chandler Hey man, how did the audition go?
joey Estelle said I didn't get it.
rachel What?! Why? Joey you were so ready for it!
joey Yeah, I thought so too but, she said the casting people had some problems with me.
ross What kind of problem?
joey Well to tell you the truth, they uh, they had a problem with the bag!
chandler Oh my God!
ross Nooooo!
joey Y'know what? It was a stupid play anyway!
monica Y'know, Joey, I think it's time to give up the bag.
joey I don't wanna give up the bag. I don't have to give up the bag! Do I Rach? Oh, you think I should give up the bag!
rachel Honey wait, Joey, I'm sorry I mean as terrific as I think you are with it
chandler Oh, hey!
rachel ...I just don't know if the world is ready for you and your bag.
joey I can't believe I'm hearing this!
rachel Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I'm not saying that you shouldn't have a bag, I just-it's just there are other bags that are a little less umm, controversial.
chandler Yeah umm, they're called wallets.
