phoebe Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "forget about her" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, "Oh my god." So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?
rachel Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me!
ross Rach!
rachel Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?
ross It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?
rachel What?
ross You're bleeding.
rachel I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wanna hear everything! Everything.
ross Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.
rachel These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country.
julie Thank you. I'm from New York.
rachel Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok.
chandler No way!
monica I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross!
phoebe Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?
joey Um, this?
phoebe Yes.
monica Guys, you got your hair cut.
chandler Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.
phoebe 'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice.
rachel Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp.
chandler Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs.
rachel You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!
ross That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler.  Phoebe.  Joey, what up?
joey What up?!
ross Everyone, this is Julie.
rachel Julie.
all Ohh. Hi!
julie Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me.
ross And bus.
julie Oh my god.
ross The screaming guy?
julie And the spitting?
ross You gotta hear this story.
julie We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old...
ross 200 at least.
julie ...and this guy...
rachel And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about.
monica This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?
julie Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
ross But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
rachel Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
monica It's an expression.
ross Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby.
julie And then we've gotta get some sleep.
ross Yeah, it's really 6
chandler Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen though, 'cause I like to be surprised.
rachel Bye.
ross Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
rachel Yeah, sure.
ross Thank you.
chandler Hey, Rach, can I get...
rachel Did you talk to him?
chandler Not yet.
rachel Then, no.
chandler So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
ross I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
chandler God?
ross It was you, pal.
chandler Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
ross Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
chandler Well, you owe me one, big guy.
rachel Here's your lemonade.
ross I didn't order lemonade.
rachel Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
ross But...
rachel Go-go-go-go, come on! So uh, what did you find out?
chandler He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
rachel How is that the silver lining?
chandler You have to really wanna see it.
ross Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym.
monica Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking?
phoebe Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?
monica No, although now that's what I'm thinking.
phoebe All right, so what were you thinking?
monica Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?
phoebe Ohh! No.
monica Why not?
phoebe Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.
monica No you're not.
phoebe I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings.
joey Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you.
ross Hello? Hi.
chandler Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
joey Needs some clothes altered?
chandler No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.
joey Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?
chandler Okay.  You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
ross Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
rachel She didn't hang up either!
ross Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y...
rachel Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.
ross Rachel! I'll just call her back.
rachel Okay!
ross Hi?  Sorry, we got disconnected...
rachel Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have.
monica Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.
rachel I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here.
chandler Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her.
joey You know, I think I was sixteen.
monica Please, just a little bit off the back.
phoebe I'm still on "no."
rachel Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?
joey No-no-no-no-no, I'm not fallin' for that again.
phoebe What's goin' on?
rachel Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night.
chandler What stupid thing did you do?
paulo Bon giorno tutti!
phoebe Ewww!
rachel Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye.
monica Rachel, how did this happen?
rachel I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night.
phoebe Where?
rachel At his apartment. Is this juice?
joey Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?
rachel Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser.
monica Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad.
chandler People do stupid things when they're upset.
monica My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't..., but this is about your horrible mistake.
all Hi!
ross Hi. Sorry we're late but we were - well, there was touching.
paulo Hey, hey Ross.
ross Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?
paulo I do Raquel.
ross So, uh, he's back.
rachel Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?
ross No, not a problem.
rachel Good! I'm glad it's not a problem.
phoebe Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.
chandler Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered.
joey Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means.
chandler Are you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?
monica You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.
phoebe All right. Ok, but, but!  You have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it.
monica I promise.
phoebe All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing.
phoebe All right, that's it, I quit.
monica What? I didn't say anything.
phoebe Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.
monica I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.
phoebe Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
monica How who wears it?
phoebe Demi Moore.
monica Demi Moore is not a he.
phoebe Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten.
monica That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
phoebe Oh.  Oh!
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Oh my God!
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?
monica She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!
phoebe Oh, she's got gorgeous hair.
monica I know!
frankie How long do you want the cuffs?
chandler At least as long as I have the pants.
frankie I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam.
rachel How is she?
phoebe It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
ross How's the hair?
phoebe I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
joey Can we see her?
phoebe Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
ross Yeah.
joey How're you doing?
rachel I'm okay.
joey Ooh, that bad, huh?
rachel What?
joey Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
rachel When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
joey You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
rachel Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
joey What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
rachel I don't know, I don't know.
joey Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
chandler Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man!
joey Frankie? What're you talking about?
ross Hey, what's goin' on?
chandler Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
ross What?
joey No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
chandler Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
ross What?
chandler Cupping.
joey That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
ross Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
joey What? That's not? Oh my God.
monica Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
ross I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
monica Thank you. My hair is very amused.
chandler Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
phoebe Thank you.
ross Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
rachel Wait, are you leaving?
ross Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
rachel Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
ross Okay.
joey Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
chandler That's ok.
ross What's goin' on?
rachel Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
ross Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
rachel No. No-no-no-no.
ross Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actually - I-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
rachel Really?
ross You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?
rachel No, I think that was the whole all.
ross Okay.  Okay. Okay.
joey I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
julie I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut?
phoebe Oh yeah!  Oh, I can do that.
julie Really?
phoebe You wanna do it right now?
julie Great!
phoebe Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?
rachel No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
phoebe Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.
rachel You're welcome.
