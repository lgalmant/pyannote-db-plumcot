chandler Hi!
ross Hey!
monica Hey!
chandler We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
phoebe Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
monica Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
joey I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
chandler And so incorrect!
monica She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
ross Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
chandler Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
monica And a lot could still get in our way.
chandler Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
phoebe What are you gonna name the baby?
chandler I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
joey But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
monica Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
chandler So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
monica You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
chandler Yes, but...
monica Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
chandler Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
rachel Hey, who's Phoebe with?
joey I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
phoebe Hey!
joey So... who's your friend?
phoebe Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
joey OW, why, why, why?
phoebe Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
joey Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
phoebe Mandy.
joey Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
phoebe No.
joey I know why I don't remember her, huh?
rachel Do you think I'm someone else?
joey Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
rachel Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
joey Growth!
phoebe Fine, I'll give you her number.
joey Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
phoebe SARAH!
joey Saraaah.
ross Hey!
rachel Hi!
ross Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
rachel Oh!
ross How does this look?
rachel Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
ross C'mon! This looks good!
rachel Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
ross Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
phoebe Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
ross Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
joey I can see why, nice shirt!
ross You're wearing the same shirt.
joey Stupid Gap on every corner!
agency_guy Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
monica Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
chandler Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
monica Uh, we're gonna be great.
chandler You're gonna be great.
monica Well... obviously!
agency_guy Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
monica Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
erica Hi...
chandler Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
erica Hi.
agency_guy I'll let you get acquainted.
chandler Ok.
erica So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
chandler That's what our friends call us.
erica Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
monica I don't know about that.
erica You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
chandler I don't think that's exactly...
monica Let her finish, doctor.
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey.
phoebe Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
joey Well...
phoebe Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
joey Nope.
phoebe What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
joey Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
phoebe That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
joey Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
phoebe What?
joey ALL FOOD!
phoebe I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
joey Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
phoebe Oh
rachel Hi
phoebe Thank God you're here. Listen to this!
rachel what?
phoebe Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
rachel Oh! Oh, no!
phoebe What? You know about the plate thing?
rachel Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and..
phoebe You wouldn't let her have a grape?
rachel Oh no! Not me! Emma!
joey JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
phoebe Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
joey I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
phoebe This place is awesome!
ross You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
rachel Ah, this place is great!
phoebe Wow!
ross Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it!
rachel Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! I mean, this is just beautiful!
ross Wow, this is really soft Three hundred and fifty dollars?
rachel Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
ross Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
phoebe Hey, check this out! It's totally you!
ross Wow!
phoebe Yeah!
ross Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
phoebe What? They will be!
ross All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
rachel No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
ross Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
rachel Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
ross Really?
rachel Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
ross So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
rachel Why do men keep talking to me like this?
chandler So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
erica Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought "who better then a minister to raise a child!"
monica Amen.
chandler Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
monica Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
erica Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
monica It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
erica Wow.
chandler Yeah, wow.
erica I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
monica Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
erica Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
chandler No-ot for me it doesn't.
agency_guy So, how's everything going in here?
erica We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
agency_guy Do you have any question for Erica?
chandler Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
agency_guy Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.
chandler You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
agency_guy Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
erica Actually, I don't think we have to.
monica We don't?
erica Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. I've made my decision. I choose them.
monica Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! Did you hear that?
chandler Yeah, I did.
monica Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. You are SO going to Heaven!
rachel We got some really great stuff!
phoebe Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
rachel Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
phoebe Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
rachel Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
phoebe oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
ross So? What do you think?
joey I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
ross Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
joey Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
ross Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
joey Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
ross You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
chandler We are NOT signing those papers.
monica Why not?
chandler It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
monica God works in mysterious ways.
chandler You have gotta stop!
monica But she liked us.
chandler She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
monica Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
chandler Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
monica C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
chandler But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
monica Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
chandler I know..
monica I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
chandler oh, honey..
monica Please.. please, we are so close.
chandler Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Monica: okay, right.
chandler So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
monica Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
chandler You're Jewish.
monica Technicality!
waiter A garden salad for the lady
joey Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
waiter Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
sarah Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
joey oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
sarah Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
joey Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
joey How about those fries though, huh?
sarah They are delicious
joey You are beautiful, you know that?
sarah Oh, that is so sweet..
joey Oh okay..
joey NOW look what you did!!
sarah What? what is the matter with you?
joey I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
sarah But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
joey WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
sarah Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
joey I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do
girl Wow, this place looks great.

girl Me too!

sarah Sure Just not as much as clams.
joey Well, stuffed clams.
waiter Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
joey Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
waiter Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
joey So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
sarah Oh my God!
joey Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.

sarah Mmmm! Mmm!
sarah Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
joey Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
sarah What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
joey Sure I do. Coule?
sarah No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
joey Really?
sarah Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
joey Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
joey Stop staring at me!
joey Why, just a tiny little...
joey Oh-oh!
joey I'm not even sorry.
erica Hi!
adoption_agency_guy Hey.
chandler Hey.
agency_guy So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
monica I-Is... Is that a picture?
erica Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
monica Look, doctor!
agency_guy I don't understand.
chandler The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
erica What?
agency_guy That's impossible.
chandler I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
agency_guy I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
erica So who are you?
chandler Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
monica Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
erica So you lied to me before?
monica Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
erica I can't believe this.
monica But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
erica Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
monica Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
erica I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
chandler Erica wait!
erica I've nothing to say to you.
chandler You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
erica Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
chandler Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
erica Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.
chandler But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
chandler You still want that baby?
monica God bless you Chandler Bing!
ross Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
joey So, why are you still wearing it?
ross Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
joey Ooh... Not so good.
ross Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
joey Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
joey JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
