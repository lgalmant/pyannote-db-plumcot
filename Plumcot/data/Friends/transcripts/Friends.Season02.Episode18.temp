amber Oh Drake.
dr_remore I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
ross I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?
monica We, we just wanna see the end.
amber I want you Drake.
dr_remore I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
amber What?
dr_remore There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
rachel So what happens next?
joey Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed.
chandler God that is good TV.
chandler Phoebs, play with meeee.
phoebe No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation.
chandler Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time.
phoebe Why don't you play with your roommate?
chandler Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball.
phoebe Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?
chandler No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room.
phoebe Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?
chandler We don't need to remedy that.
phoebe Oh yeah, it'll be fun.
eddie What was that?
phoebe Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other.
eddie Yeah alright, that sounds alright.
phoebe Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye.
chandler That was so lame.
phoebe I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him.
chandler So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?
eddie That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?
chandler What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
eddie That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh...
chandler Well it's not Sean Penn.
eddie Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop. That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?
richard Phoebe's got another job, right?
rachel Great set tonight Phoebs.
phoebe I know.
ross Well, we should probably get going.
richard Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring.
monica Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place.
richard I don't know, I don't have my jammies.
monica Well, maybe you don't need them.
ross My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.
monica Shut up, I'm happy.
phoebe Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best.
richard Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet.
phoebe Ok.
richard Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot.
monica Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy.
rachel Phoebe's dead.
tilly Hi.
chandler Hi.
tilly I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
chandler Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a fishtank?
tilly Thanks.
chandler Oh, oh, c'mon in.
tilly I'm Tilly.
chandler Oh.
tilly I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
chandler Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul.
tilly He's kind of intense huh?
chandler Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little...
eddie A little what?
chandler Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
eddie Hello Tilly.
tilly Eddie, I just came by to drop off your tank.
eddie That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
tilly Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye.
eddie Bye-bye.
chandler Bye.
chandler So, we gettin' a fish?
eddie You had sex with her didn't you?
joey Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out.
phoebe Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests.
joey Page 42, page 42, page 42.
phoebe Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture.
joey Ooh, I look good.
phoebe Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?
joey Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'
phoebe Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?
joey Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?
writer Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed.
joey I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?
delivery_guy Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts.
joey They can't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son.
delivery_guy Right. Could you sign this?
joey No. No way, I'm not signing that.
delivery_guy I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
joey How can they do this to me?
delivery_guy Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry.
monica Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage.
rachel Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious.
ross G'night.
richard Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
monica Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with.
richard Two.
monica Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?
richard Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two.
monica Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth.
richard Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark.
monica Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark.
rachel Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.
ross Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?
rachel Uhhhooo.
ross C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them.
rachel Well, there's you.
ross Better not be doin' these in order.
rachel Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo.
ross Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini.
rachel Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.
ross Really?
rachel Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head.
chandler Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.
eddie That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.
chandler This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story.
eddie Where's Buddy?
chandler Buddy?
eddie My fish, Buddy.
chandler There was no fish when she dropped it off.
eddie Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy?
chandler Hey I didn't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon?
richard That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
monica Well yeah.
richard Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet.
monica You really ok with it?
richard Oh honey, I'm fine.
monica Oh, yay. Ok about that two.
richard What? Alright, what about my two?
monica Well, it just seems like a really small number.
richard Right, and...
monica And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?
richard Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with.
monica But you've only slept with two people.
richard Right.
monica Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right.
richard Now I do.
rachel Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.
ross Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes.
rachel God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was...
ross Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?
rachel Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo.
ross Knock-knock.
rachel But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had.
ross Until now.
rachel Oh, hi.
monica Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
rachel Oh my God, honey that's great.
monica I know. I just can't find...
rachel Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
monica You need one too?
rachel Ooooh yeah.
monica There's only one.
richard Monica.
monica Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something.
ross Rachel. Hey.
richard Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
ross Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?
richard No.
ross Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?
richard I have a little comb.
ross Oh. And what do you call that?
richard A moustache comb.
rachel Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month.
monica No.
rachel Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months.
monica Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan.
rachel Agghhh.
ross So were you in Nam?
rachel Rock-paper-scissors?
monica Yeah.
rachel_and_monica One two three.
rachel Yeesss.
monica Fine, go have sex.
richard No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.
ross No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was...
rachel Honey.
ross What, what oh....
richard Shall we?
monica It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow.
richard Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand...
chandler So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes.
monica Why?
chandler Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.
phoebe Why would you kill his fish?
chandler Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish.
rachel Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please?
ross Yeah.
monica Wait, he's not here yet.
rachel So, he's on the show, he knows what happens.
ross Yeah.
monica Alright.
chandler Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.
rachel Oh good.
dr_remore Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.
amber Oh Drake.
dr_horton Hard day huh? First the medical award, this.
dr_remore Some guys are just lucky I guess.
intercom Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat.
dr_remore Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?
dr_horton No, no, they only said you.
dr_remore Oh, ok. Alright.

ross C'mon.
rachel Joey.
ross Open up. We want to talk to you.
joey I don't feel like talkin.
rachel Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you.
chandler We're worried about you.
monica And some of us really have to pee.
monica Sorry Joey
joey Hey.
phoebe Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks.
chandler We came over as soon as we saw.
ross How could you not tell us?
joey I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out.
rachel Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back.
joey Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin.
phoebe But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera.
joey Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
phoebe Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say.
monica Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice.
chandler It's gonna be ok. You know that?
joey No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life.
chandler I'm sorry man.
rachel Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.
joey No, that means nothin to me.
chandler Uhhhaahh.
eddie Pecan sandy, just made em.
chandler Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?
eddie Uh, sure, why not.
chandler Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?
eddie I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you.
chandler Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker.
