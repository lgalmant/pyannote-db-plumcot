chandler Wow! That ripped! That ripped real nice!
joey How many times do I have to tell you! Ya, turn and sliiiide! Y'know, turn and slide.
chandler You don't turn and slide, you throw it out! I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time I get dressed!
joey Look, we're not throwing it out! I built this thing with my own hands!
chandler All right, how about we, how 'bout we sell it.
joey All right. But, you're gonna have to tell them.
chandler Do you mind if we stick you in another cabinet? They seem all right with it!
chip Hey Monica, it's Chip.

ross Who's Chip?
monica Shhh!
chip Good runnin' into you at the bank today, so ah, here's my number, 555-9323. Give me a call. Later.
monica Chip, is Chip Matthews.
ross The guy who took Rachel to the prom? Why is he calling you?
monica 'Cause I ran into him at the bank, he is still soo cute.
ross Monica, you're so lucky! He's like the most popular guy in school!!
monica I know!! Chip? Hi! It's Monica. 'Kay. 'Kay. Okay. Okay, good-bye. Oh my God, we just had the best conversation!!
ross I was just leaving.
rachel Good! 'Cause I've got a product report to read, it's like eight pages, I hope I don't fall asleep.
ross Why? Did you write it?
rachel Wow! Look at that, Chip Matthews called. I wonder what he wants?
ross Well ah, actually...
rachel I bet he sensed that I was ready to have sex with another guy.
ross Well, umm, why don't you give him a call?
rachel Okay. Are you sure you wanna hear this?
ross Oh, I'm sure.
rachel Chip! Hi, it's Rachel. Rachel Green. Yeah, umm, you left me a message. Yes you did, my roommate wrote it down. Monica Geller. Ohh.
ross Oh, that's right! He called to ask out Monica! That-that's gotta be embarrassing!
phoebe ...DUMB, DRUNKEN, BITCH!!! Thank you, thanks.
ross Hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak East of the Mississippi?
chandler Uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
ross I'm reading your ad.
joey Looks good, uh?
ross Yeah.
chandler Stunning entertainment center. Fine, fine Italian craftsmanship.
phoebe Oh my God, you guys are selling the entertainment center?
rachel Why? I love that thing.
chandler You want it?
phoebe_and_rachel Oh no.
chandler Ahh, Gepeto, $5,000 dollars? Are you insane?
joey Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks!
chandler All right look, I'm changing it to 50 bucks, or your best offer.
joey What kind of profit is that?! And you call yourself an accountant.
chandler Nooo.
joey Oh. What do you do?
chandler I can't believe you don't know what I do for a living!
phoebe Yeah, I actually don't know...
ross Good, so do I
rachel Something to do with numbers?
phoebe Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! Come on. Crazy. Oh my God.
rachel What?
phoebe Nothing. Nothing.
joey What? What's wrong?
phoebe I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.
rachel You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!
phoebe No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.
ross Are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
phoebe No Dr. Skeptismo! I'm sure. First of all, okay, there's the feeling. Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. My Mother's favourite fish is Orange Roughy... Cats....like....fish! Hi, Mommy. Oh, I haven't seen this smile in 17 years!
joey Dude, Phoebe's mom has got a huge peni...
chandler Let it go!!
monica Hey!
rachel Umm, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with Chip Matthews?
monica Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
rachel Nooo! It's not okay! I can't believe you would want to after what he did to me!
monica What, that little thing at the prom?
rachel Monica! I couldn't find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!
monica Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?
rachel I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!
monica Look, you and I went to different high schools...
rachel Okay, that doesn't help me, because we went to the same high school.
monica You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
rachel They had to have that specially made?!
monica It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.
rachel Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!
monica Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.
rachel Oh, you go out with him.
monica Oh, really?!
rachel Yeah. Just, if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?
monica I'll try.
ross So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
joey Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I don't think any of them are gonna work out.
chandler Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.
phoebe Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.
ross So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?
phoebe Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced. Well, that's not gonna happen is it? Noo. Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.
monica Why can't you use the phone in here?
phoebe Well, I'm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word.
ross So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebe's mom remind anyone of a cat?
monica Ross, don't start.
ross Come on, you-you can't tell me you actually believe that-that there's a woman inside that cat!
rachel I believe it.
ross No you don't.
rachel Yes, I do.
ross No you do - y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
rachel Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.
ross I do not always have to be - okay, okay.
rachel Jurassic Park could happen.
tony Wow! That's ah, that's pretty nice!
joey Pretty nice?
chandler You'll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.
tony We don't have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? We've got a canoe.
chandler Y'know, I, I really don't think we need a canoe.
tony You gotta take the canoe!
chandler All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!
peter We're not throwing it away! I built that canoe!
joey Good for you!!
rachel You guys, you're never gonna believe what I just found tacked up on a telephone pole! Look kinda familiar?
ross Apparently Phoebe's mother also goes by the name Julio.
rachel You guys, there's a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!
joey Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!
rachel Do we have to tell her?
ross Yes, we have to tell her!
monica Oh, but it's made her so happy.
ross Little girl misses her cat. Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.
all Yeah.
ross Thank you.
rachel I hate when Ross is right!
monica He is right, isn't he?
chandler Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times he's wrong.
all You think?
chandler Oh-no, he's right.
phoebe Hi.
monica Hi!
all Hey!
joey Uh, Pheebs, about your mom...
phoebe Yeah?
joey How's that going?
phoebe So great. Oh, we took a nap today and my Mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.

monica Huh? What'd ya say Joe? I'll be right there.

rachel I'm great! I'm great. I've got a great job at Bloomingdale's, have wonderful friends, and eventhough I'm not seeing anyone right now, I've never felt better about myself.
chip So ah, Monica ready yet?
rachel She'll be out in a second. So, Chip, how's umm, Amy Welch?
chip Amy Welch? Wow! I haven't seen her since... So, Monica about ready?
joey This is the unit for you my friend. Sturdy construction, tons of storage compartments, some big enough to fit a grown man.
guy What?!
joey Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldn't, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny 'til I started feeling like I was in a coffin.
guy No, you, you can't fit in that thing. That's not deep enough.
joey Oh yeah? If I can't, I'll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.
guy All right, you have yourself a deal.
joey Okay. See?! I told ya!
joey Sometimes I get in here just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel!!
chip Here, we are.
monica Oh my God! You still have the Chipper!
chip The what?
monica That's what we used to call your ah, your motorcycle in high school. Y'know how a motorcycle is a Chopper, and you're Chip. Nevermind.
chip No, I think it's cute.
monica Wow! A lipper from Chipper.
chip So you still in touch with anyone from high school?
monica Umm. Well, there's Rachel, and umm, I think that's it. How bout you?
chip Oh yeah, I still hang with Simmons and Zana, y'know. I see Spindler a lot. Devane, Kelly, and I run into Goldie from time to time. Steve Brown, Zuchoff, McGwire, J.T., Breadsly.
monica Is that all?
chip Ehh, y'know after high school, you just kinda lose touch. Oh yeah! I ran into Richard Dorfman.
monica Ohh, how is he?
chip Not so good, Simmons and I gave him a wedgie.
monica Isn't he an architect now?
chip Yeah, they still wear underwear.
chandler OH MY GOD!!!
joey WHAT?!!
chandler Are you all right?!
joey Yeah...
chandler What happened?!!
joey Awww, man! He promised he wouldn't take the chairs!!
chandler What the hell happened?!! How were you locked in?!! And where the hell is all of our stuff?!!
joey Well, this guy came by to look at the unit and-and he said he didn't think big enough to fit a grown man!
chandler So - You got in voluntarily?!
joey I was tryin' to make a sale!! Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again, do you know what I'm gonna do?
chandler BEND OVER?!!!
chip ...and then Zana, just let one rip!!
monica Look, not that I enjoy talking about people who I went to high school with, 'cause I do, but umm, maybe we could talk about something else? Like you, I don't even know where you work?
chip You know where I work!
monica I do?
chip The movie theatre, you used to come in all the time.
monica You still work at the multiplex?
chip Oh, like I'd give up that job! Free popcorn and candy, anytime I want. I can get you free posters for your room.
monica Thanks, I'm set. Do you still live with your parents?
chip Oh yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.
rachel Wow! They really got you guys. Your T.V. The chairs.
phoebe Oh yeah, your microwave. The stereo.
joey Aww, man, he took the five of spades!! Oh, no-no-no, here it is!
monica Oh my God! What happened?
chandler Oh, umm, Joey was born, and then 28 years later, I was robbed!!
rachel So, how was your date?
monica Well, y'know how I always wanted to go out with Chip Matthews in high school?
rachel Um-hmm.
monica Well, tonight, I actually went out with Chip Matthews in high school.
rachel Oh honey, I'm sorry.
monica No, it's okay, not only did I get to go out with Chip Matthews, I got to dump Chip Matthews.
rachel Ohh! That's so great!
monica I know!
ross Hey! So ah, what did the insurance company say?
chandler Oh, they said uh, “You don't have insurance here, so stop calling us.”
ross You didn't tell her?! Okay, fine! Pheebs?
phoebe Yeah? Hi!
ross Hi! Listen uhh, this cat belongs to a little girl. There are flyers all over the place.
rachel I'm sorry, sweetie.
monica Hey, we can take her back with you if you want.
phoebe Ohh. Um-hmm. But y'know, she choose to find me. I mean, I have to respect her decision. Right?
ross No! No! Look - Hey, enough is enough! Look, I am sorry that you feel guilty or whatever about spending time with your new mom, but this is not your old mom. This is a cat! Okay, Julio the cat! Not mom! Cat!
phoebe Ross, how many parents have you lost?
ross None.
phoebe Okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if I'm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.
ross I'm sorry.
phoebe Okay.
ross I don't know what to say.
rachel You could.... say you're sorry to her mom.
phoebe I think she would like that.
ross Come here, here, come here, come here, Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
phoebe Thank you. We both forgive you.
rachel So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
phoebe Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And you're welcome to come back anytime.
chandler Pheebs, if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.
phoebe Come on, Mom, I'll take you home.
rachel I'll go with you.
monica Me too.
ross Oh! Y'know, I've got an extra futon.
joey Dude, you don't have to brag! We got nothing here!!
