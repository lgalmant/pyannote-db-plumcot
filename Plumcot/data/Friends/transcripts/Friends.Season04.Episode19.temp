rachel HEY!! Do you have to do that? It's Saturday!
the_singing_man Oh come on! Morning's here! Morning's here! The morning is here! Sunshine is here!
rachel I hate this apartment! I hate the color of these walls! I hate the fact that this place still smells like bird! I hate that singing guy!
joey Are you kidding? I love that guy! Morning's here! Morning is here-
rachel Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.
monica Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.
rachel Monica, you don't even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!
monica Y'know what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!
rachel I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
monica Okay.
joey See, this is a great apartment.
monica Shut up! This place is a hole!
emily Oh, blimey, I still can't believe you've got an earring!
ross Huh? I know, I know. Who am I? David Bowe?
emily He does that?!
ross Uh, I don't know, whatever.
emily I think it makes you look really dangerous.
ross Oh, I know. Y'know what, I never would've gotten this if it weren't for you. No really, when I'm with you I'm-I'm like this whole other guy, I love that guy! I mean, I love you too, a lot, but that guy! I-I love that guy!
emily I love both of you!
ross Yeah?
emily I wish I didn't have to go.
ross Then don't. Stay here. Just don't go so soon to London, just one more day.
emily Ohh, Ross, please!
ross One more day, seriously/
emily Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.
ross So, then you can stay as long as you want.
emily I wish I could.
ross Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
emily I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.
ross Yeah, I know, I uh, I tried them on.
emily You didn't!
ross No. No, I didn't. I didn't want to be that guy.
phoebe Hello!
chandler Ho! Ho! Ho!

phoebe Oh, yeah! You like 'em? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!
joey Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.
phoebe What?
chandler Santa pants. Santa Claus's pants.

chandler Are you serious?
rachel Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.
monica Yeah, what, do you think we're stupid?
joey You're not stupid. You're meaner than I thought.
monica What do you say?
chandler Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!
rachel You're bachelor pad?!
monica Have you even had a girl up here?
chandler No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.
joey Yeah, you do!
joey Come on!
chandler Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?
gunther Good one.
joey Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?
chandler Forget it! Okay, I'm not giving up the apartment.
joey Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
ross Hey, guys!
joey Hey!
chandler Oh my God!
joey We don't make enough fun of you already?
ross Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.
chandler You do know that Wham broke up?
ross I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
joey Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.
chandler Where is Emily?
ross Ugh, she's saying good-bye to her uncle.
chandler Man, didn't she like just get here?
ross Yeah!! Yeah!
chandler Easy tiger.
ross I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
chandler So what are you going to do?
ross Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
joey What?
ross I could ask her to live with me!
chandler Are you serious?
ross I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
chandler Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
ross Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
chandler And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
joey All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
ross I don't want to do that.
joey No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
ross Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
chandler Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
phoebe That's too hard. Too hard!
monica All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
rachel Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
chandler No thank you.
joey Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
chandler Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
joey Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
chandler Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
joey It's the Knicks!
chandler Screw the Knicks!
joey Whoa!
chandler I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.
joey Huh.
chandler And the Knicks rule all.
joey Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
phoebe Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
chandler No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
rachel All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
joey Done!
rachel Let me finish.
joey Oh.
rachel I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.
joey Ooh, we could end up with nothing.
phoebe Or you could end up with everything.
joey Ooh, I like that.
monica All right, so what do you say?
chandler No!
monica Oh, just do it!!
chandler Op, op, I'm convinced!
joey Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
chandler All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
joey All right!
phoebe Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?
rachel Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because she's the only who's impartial, and she's so pretty.
phoebe Okay. Umm, ooh, ooh-oh, I have a game!
joey Okay!
chandler Okay!
phoebe This is great!
joey What's the game?! What's the game?!
phoebe Oh, well, it doesn't have a name-oh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesn't have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?
monica They're green?
phoebe Good! Good! Five points!
phoebe All right, Joey, same question.
joey Uhh, they're tall.
phoebe Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.
monica That's not even a game!
rachel What? Shut up! We're winning!
monica You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?
chandler Fine, let's do it.

chandler Why are you screaming and hugging?
monica Because we won our apartment back!
joey What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!
monica No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!
phoebe I don't know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! Ah-ha!
rachel All right, cut, let's pick again, pick again.

chandler Tickets please! That's courtside baby!
joey Seriously, good game though. Good game. What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!
chandler No they didn't!
ross Hey!
emily I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.
ross Move in with me.
emily What?!
ross Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
emily Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
ross I know.
emily My job!
ross Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
emily Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
ross No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
emily Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future -and-and-and we were getting married or something.
ross What?
emily Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
ross No, no, don't. Why don't we?
emily Why don't we what?
ross Get married.
emily You are mad!
ross No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
emily We've only known each other for six weeks!
ross Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
emily My parents are going to be really mad.
ross Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?
emily Yes.
emily Yes!
ross Yes! We're getting married?!
emily Oh my God!
ross Yes!
emily We're getting married!
ross Come here, come here. Uh, ow! Emily, will you marry me?
emily Yes.
emily Ohh, it's a bit small.
ross Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
emily It was.
chandler Those were like the best seats ever.
joey Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
chandler Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
chandler Oh. Oh, God!
joey Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
chandler I KNOW!!!
chandler Open up! Open up! Open up!
monica We'll discuss it, in the morning!
chandler What the hell is going on?!
rachel We took our apartment back!!
phoebe I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
chandler We are switching back, right now!
monica No, we're not! We're not leaving!
chandler Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
joey I don't know.
chandler What?
joey I don't want to move again!
chandler I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
rachel All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
chandler Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
rachel Let us keep the apartment and
monica As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.
chandler Totally worth it!
joey That was one good minute!
chandler Good night.
joey Good night.
monica Men are such idiots.
rachel Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
phoebe That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
monica Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Okay, scarf's done.
ross Come on! Come on. Come on.
chandler Okay!
phoebe Hey!

phoebe What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!
emily Umm, no.
monica When, when did-how, how did you
ross We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.
emily I mean, we know it's a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, so
ross Umm, uh, I was just telling the guys
rachel Yeah, I-I heard. I think it's great! Ohh, I'm so happy for you!
chandler Oh, well, that's great!
joey Yeah! Yeah!
monica I can't believe you're getting married!
