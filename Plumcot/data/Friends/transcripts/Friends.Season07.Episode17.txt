dr_ross_geller Oh great! We're going out again Saturday. But I just found she's also seeing some other guy.
chandler_bing Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
joey_tribbiani Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
dr_ross_geller Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
chandler_bing So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Kristen Lang.
chandler_bing Bye!
dr_ross_geller Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
joey_tribbiani Obviously! So, how do we decide?
dr_ross_geller Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
dr_ross_geller That's interesting, but check this out. I date her
joey_tribbiani Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
joey_tribbiani Yeah well we should order some food then.
dr_ross_geller No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
joey_tribbiani That sounds fair.
dr_ross_geller Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
joey_tribbiani Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
dr_ross_geller Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
joey_tribbiani All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
dr_ross_geller So let's decide on the spending limit
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Uh,..a slice......six dollars?
dr_ross_geller I was thinking more like a hundred.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
monica_geller Oh
phoebe_buffay I know. Hand me a tissue.
rachel_green You're out of Diet Coke.
monica_geller Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
phoebe_buffay What?!
monica_geller That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
phoebe_buffay Does that mean Carcass is available?
monica_geller What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
phoebe_buffay Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
monica_geller How?
rachel_green You're out of toilet paper!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey! What's up?
joey_tribbiani I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
dr_ross_geller Oh thanks!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
dr_ross_geller We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
joey_tribbiani Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
dr_ross_geller I am dressed.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
dr_ross_geller I have an oily T-zone!
joey_tribbiani Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
dr_ross_geller That's right.
joey_tribbiani You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
dr_ross_geller Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Why am I not surprised?
joey_tribbiani Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
dr_ross_geller I don't think you have much choice.
joey_tribbiani Well we'll see!
dr_ross_geller Bye-bye!
joey_tribbiani Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
dr_ross_geller Yes. Yes. Just here and there
chandler_bing Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, swing music is so out.
monica_geller Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
chandler_bing What are you guys talking about?
monica_geller Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
rachel_green Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
chandler_bing But I love swing music!
phoebe_buffay Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
chandler_bing Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
rachel_green Well, what is the other reason?
chandler_bing I don't want to say.
rachel_green Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
chandler_bing Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
monica_geller Oh crap!
dr_ross_geller So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
kristen_lang Oh great!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
kristen_lang Is your back feeling better?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
joey_tribbiani Kristen?
kristen_lang Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
kristen_lang Hi! What are you doing here?
joey_tribbiani Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I
kristen_lang Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
joey_tribbiani Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
kristen_lang Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. So
joey_tribbiani Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
dr_ross_geller So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
kristen_lang Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
dr_ross_geller That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
joey_tribbiani A woman in a man's body.
dr_ross_geller Much better.
joey_tribbiani So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
dr_ross_geller Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
kristen_lang Yeah, little Eric.
dr_ross_geller That's right! Wait no, Ben.
joey_tribbiani So you've just married the one time then?
dr_ross_geller Well umm
kristen_lang You've been married twice?
dr_ross_geller Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
kristen_lang You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
kristen_lang Do you two know each other?
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani No. No.
joey_tribbiani No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
joey_tribbiani Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
dr_ross_geller Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
joey_tribbiani Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
joey_tribbiani Monkey lover!
joey_tribbiani When do you think we lost her?
dr_ross_geller Probably around gonorrhea.
chandler_bing Hi, honey! I'm home!
monica_geller Don't come in here!
chandler_bing Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
monica_geller No! We only mess around at his place!
chandler_bing Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
monica_geller No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
chandler_bing Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
monica_geller Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
chandler_bing Well then why can't I see it?
monica_geller Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
chandler_bing Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
monica_geller Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
chandler_bing Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
monica_geller Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
chandler_bing Okay!
monica_geller Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
chandler_bing I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
monica_geller All right? What's going on?
monica_geller I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
