dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey, so did everything go okay with the annulment?
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, no problems. It's all taken care of.
rachel_green Ross, thank you. Hey, do you guys wanna go see a movie?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, why not?
rachel_green Okay, umm, I'm gonna get my sweater.
dr_ross_geller Okay. You uh, you wanna hear something weird?
phoebe_buffay Always.
dr_ross_geller I didn't get the annulment.
phoebe_buffay What?!
dr_ross_geller We're still married! Don't tell Rachel. See you later.
dr_ross_geller Hey, do you have any gum?
rachel_green Oh? Yeah! Sure!
phoebe_buffay Wait! Wait! Hi! Listen, Ross can I just talk to you for just a second?
rachel_green Oh but Phoebe, we're gonna be late for the movie.
phoebe_buffay Oh, there's a cab! Taxi!! Good timing, my God, huh? Here you go.
rachel_green Yeah, we're, we're actually just gonna walk 'cause it's right up there at the Angelica.
phoebe_buffay Oh, the Angelica!! Go! Go! You didn't get the annulment?!!
dr_ross_geller I know.
phoebe_buffay Ross?!
dr_ross_geller Well, I tried! But when I got to my lawyer's office all I could hear was, "Three divorces. Three divorces!" Look, I just don't want my tombstone to read, Ross Gellar, Three Divorces.
phoebe_buffay Don't be worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, Ross Geller, Good at Marriage! Y'know? Mine's gonna say Phoebe Buffay, Buried Alive.
dr_ross_geller Look, all I know is I-I can't have another failed marriage!
phoebe_buffay So okay what? You're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?!-Op, woman! Sorry.
dr_ross_geller Well, okay so, I don't have it all worked out quite yet. Just don't say anything to Rachel, please?
phoebe_buffay Rachel is one of my closest friends. Although, being the only one who knows anything about this does makes me feel special. Okay!
rachel_green Okay, stop-stop! Phoebe?!
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach!
rachel_green What was that?!
phoebe_buffay Sorry, mix up. Hey, how was the movie?
rachel_green I haven't seen it yet!
phoebe_buffay Well then you'd better hurry! The Angelica! Go! Go!
rachel_green Noooooooo!!
chandler_bing Y'know when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?
monica_geller Of course! Joey wouldn't let you have one?
chandler_bing No. When it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.
monica_geller Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him you're moving out?
chandler_bing No, no, I keep trying, y'know? I can get out, "Joey, I have too..." but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "...go to the bathroom." He may think I'm sick.
monica_geller Y'know, I really have to tell Rachel, but I... We just have to get it over with! Y'know, the next time we see them we're just gonna tell them. Okay? That's it.
chandler_bing Oh, so that's this is gonna work now? You're just gonna order me around all the time?
monica_geller Pretty much.
chandler_bing All right.
joey_tribbiani Hey Monica!
monica_geller Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey man, you feeling any better?
monica_geller Joey, we have something to tell you.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! You're pregnant!
chandler_bing No-o-o! No? No-o-o! Look Joey, here's the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, I'm gonna be moving out man.
joey_tribbiani Wow! Well, uh... Hey! I'm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! See you later.
monica_geller Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. Like you'd believe that. This sucks!
chandler_bing Look, I-I'm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up I'm moving right back in with you!
joey_tribbiani Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if you're gonna be moving in with him I feel it's my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? He's a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to umm... Oh-oh he always, he always umm-Oh, who am I kidding! He's the best roommate ever!
monica_geller Hey Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey, have you seen Rachel?
phoebe_buffay No, why?
monica_geller I have some pretty exciting news!
phoebe_buffay You're pregnant!
monica_geller No! Chandler and I are moving in together!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! That's good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Hi!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller What's up?
monica_geller Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friend...shaking up. Oh, that's great. That's great.
phoebe_buffay Guys, I'm happy too.
monica_geller Okay, come here!
phoebe_buffay Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulled
monica_geller Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesn't seem so bad?
dr_ross_geller Bye.
phoebe_buffay Hmm, something bad to tell Rachel... Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!
dr_ross_geller Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebody's stairs!
phoebe_buffay Ross, it's not that big a deal! So you'll been divorced three times, you'll still have a life, you'll go on dates
dr_ross_geller No! No, I won't! I'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.
phoebe_buffay Ross, you're being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?
phoebe_buffay Y'know that's really fair. Y'know? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, I'll show you! Come here.
dr_ross_geller What?! Why?
phoebe_buffay Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldn't you date him?
dr_ross_geller And if you wait right here, I'll go get Ross.
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!
chandler_bing What gave me away?
monica_geller I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and she's the only one left!
chandler_bing Okay, so that's it, everybody knows! It's official, we're moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Wow that was my scariest voice! You're very brave.
rachel_green Hey!
chandler_bing Hey.
rachel_green Ugh, the worse day! Y'know, you think you're making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.
chandler_bing Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. Seriously.
rachel_green I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!
chandler_bing Well, I-I still think you're very-very nice and very pretty
rachel_green What?
chandler_bing All yours babe.
monica_geller Have a seat. Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.
rachel_green Oh my God! That's so great! I'm so happy for you guys!
monica_geller Really?!
rachel_green And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!
monica_geller Yes, we are.
rachel_green And Chandler, you're gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel can't be late.
chandler_bing Rach
monica_geller Yeah, he's gonna work on that.
rachel_green Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh God... Come and knock on my door
monica_geller We'll be waiting for you
dr_ross_geller ...once you know the stories, it's not that bad. First marriage, wife's hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.
phoebe_buffay Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?
stephanie Well the divorces don't bother me, I'd date him. But, not while he's still married.
phoebe_buffay Okay, what about you? Wouldn't you want a date?
karin Actually, I'm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like y'know bad for me, so until I work that out
phoebe_buffay Whatever! What about you Meg?
meg Well, I don't care about the divorces either, but I wouldn't date him. It's just that he's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.
dr_ross_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay She said, "He's obviously still in love with this Rachel girl."
dr_ross_geller This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?
phoebe_buffay Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.
dr_ross_geller We were drunk! I would've married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!
phoebe_buffay Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.
phoebe_buffay Yes, and now he's using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.
dr_ross_geller Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!
meg Okay now I wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.
karin I am so attracted to him right now.
chandler_bing Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?
monica_geller Soon! I-I just couldn't before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldn't do that to her, she's my best friend!
chandler_bing Well, Joey's my best friend.
monica_geller I'm not your best friend?
chandler_bing You just said... Of course you're my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?
monica_geller All right, all right, at least I'm prepared.
chandler_bing Okay. Oh yes.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey-hey!
monica_geller These aren't for you! Are you upset?
chandler_bing I am now!
rachel_green Hey roomie!
chandler_bing Okay, bye!
monica_geller Rach, there's something uh, important I have to tell you.
rachel_green Are you pregnant?!
monica_geller No! But, I'm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.
rachel_green Um-hmm.
monica_geller Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.
rachel_green Oh my God! Oh, that's funny, I can't believe I did that.
monica_geller Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasn't clear! I'm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? There's absolutely no rush.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Okay. Don't you want a cookie?
rachel_green Sure? Thanks.
monica_geller Maybe, do you need a tissue?
rachel_green Monica, where did you get these?!
monica_geller I made them!
rachel_green Ooh, good God, they're so yummy!
joey_tribbiani God, it's gonna so weird like when I come home and you're not here. Y'know? No more Joey and Chan's. No more J and C's. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandler's?" "Can't, its not there."
chandler_bing Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.
joey_tribbiani Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.
chandler_bing Not once did we do that.
monica_geller Hi.
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hi.
monica_geller So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.
chandler_bing Oh yeah? Well, how'd she take it?
monica_geller Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didn't cry. She wasn't angry or sad.
chandler_bing And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?
monica_geller I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!
joey_tribbiani Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! It's like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channie's!!
chandler_bing Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!
russell You got married again.
dr_ross_geller Yes.
russell So that's your second marriage in two years.
dr_ross_geller Yes, second in two years. Third overall.
russell Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why don't you tell me what happened.
dr_ross_geller Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk
russell I'm sorry, is this the same Rachel who's name you said at the altar in the second marriage?
dr_ross_geller Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.
russell Oh, that's better then.
dr_ross_geller This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.
russell I see. Have you considered therapy?
dr_ross_geller I think just the annulment for today.
russell There are a couple of forms to fill out.
dr_ross_geller Easy.
russell And we'll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.
dr_ross_geller No problem.
russell And we'll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.
dr_ross_geller Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.
russell Of course you did. Look Ross, you can't get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.
dr_ross_geller Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.
rachel_green Okay!
monica_geller Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!
rachel_green What the hell is that?
monica_geller I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.
rachel_green Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!
monica_geller Something to remember me by!
rachel_green Mon, honey you're not dying. I'm just moving out. Y'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time.
monica_geller But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!
rachel_green Are you okay? You're not blinking.
monica_geller I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.
rachel_green Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.
monica_geller An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!
rachel_green What is the matter with you?!
monica_geller What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!
rachel_green All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.
monica_geller What's hard to believe?
rachel_green Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.
monica_geller Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.
rachel_green But I
monica_geller No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.
rachel_green It is? Really?
monica_geller Yeah, sweetie.
rachel_green I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?
monica_geller No.
rachel_green What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
monica_geller I'm gonna miss you!
rachel_green I mean it's the end of an era!
monica_geller I know!
phoebe_buffay Okay, bye!
dr_ross_geller Oh no.
phoebe_buffay So? Did you get the annulment?
dr_ross_geller I couldn't.
phoebe_buffay I knew it! Because you love Rachel.
dr_ross_geller It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I
phoebe_buffay Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.
dr_ross_geller I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?
phoebe_buffay I've never been more convinced of your love for her.
dr_ross_geller I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!
dr_ross_geller Ohh, what's wrong?!
rachel_green Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.
dr_ross_geller Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.
rachel_green Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Of course.
joey_tribbiani So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?
phoebe_buffay Oh we do, but not just yet.
joey_tribbiani Really?! Well, when?
phoebe_buffay Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.
joey_tribbiani Wow.
phoebe_buffay I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.
joey_tribbiani Great!
phoebe_buffay But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh, what about Ross?
phoebe_buffay I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.
