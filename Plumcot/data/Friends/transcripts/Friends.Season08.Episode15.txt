phoebe_buffay Oh! Hey, Rach!
rachel_green Hi! Hey, Happy Valentine's Day!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you, too.
joey_tribbiani Hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at Ross'?
rachel_green It's good. Except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long. Did you know that something really boring happened to someone really ugly in the Middle Ages? Oh, thank you. I'll see you guys later.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
joey_tribbiani Bye.
joey_tribbiani There's one lucky to-go cup of coffee.
phoebe_buffay Honey, I wish you would get over her. I hate seeing you like this. Is there anything I can do for you? Do you want to look down my top?
joey_tribbiani Thanks. But maybe later.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Gunther, can I get a scone?
gunther You want anything?
joey_tribbiani You know what I want? I want a lot of things! I want to be with the woman I love on Valentine's Day! And I want her to love me back! And I want just one moment of relief from the gut-wrenching pain of knowing that that's never going to happen!
gunther We have red bagels.
joey_tribbiani Oh, okay.
phoebe_buffay So, how does Mona feel about you and Rachel living together?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm actually on my way to tell her right now. Yeah, she's been away all week visiting her parents, but she'll be cool. I mean, she's been so supportive. She-she even got the baby a tiny T-shirt that says, 'Fossils are my friends.'
phoebe_buffay Ugh. Come on, Mona, don't kiss ass.
dr_ross_geller Uh, I'm going to take off.
phoebe_buffay All right. Oh! Shoot! Oh shoot! Uh, Rachel wanted to see this tape!
dr_ross_geller What is it?
phoebe_buffay It's a video of my friend giving birth. Could you just bring it back to your apartment?
dr_ross_geller All right. 'Candy and Cookie?'
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Candy's the mother, Cookie's the daughter. The father's also Cookie. Why am I friends with these people?
monica_geller Phoebe, c'mere. I want to show you something in the bathroom.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Monica, grow up!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what's behind your back?
monica_geller Nothing. Just something I want to get Phoebe's opinion on for Valentine's Day.
dr_ross_geller You don't want my opinion?
monica_geller Not really.
dr_ross_geller Come on, I'm your older brother, ask me!
monica_geller All right, big brother. Which of these do you think would make your little sister look hotter, so your best friend would want to do her?
dr_ross_geller The red one.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Look, I know you've been really depressed lately, so I brought someone over to cheer you up. Right outside this door is a real, live, furry playmate.
joey_tribbiani No, I'm not sleeping with your friend Jane again.
phoebe_buffay He-hee!
joey_tribbiani Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane.
phoebe_buffay This is the happiest dog in the world. I borrowed him from my friend Wendy. Now, you can only keep him until he cheers you up. And he will cheer you up!
joey_tribbiani Thanks so much, Pheebs! We are going to have so much fun, yes we are! Oh! Not that kind of fun.
chandler_bing Happy Valentine's!
monica_geller Okay! I'll be right out. I'm slipping into something a little less comfortable, and a little more slutty.
chandler_bing 'Candy and Cookie'. 'Candy and Cookie?' Monica got me porn?! Girl-on-girl porn?! She really must love me!!
man_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode15 Yeah, just relax.
chandler_bing I love you, St. Valentine.
chandler_bing Woah, woah, that's not pretty!
man_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode15 Now, push!
woman_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode15 Ow! Ow! Ooh! That hurts!
chandler_bing Worst porn ever! Worst porn ever!
woman_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode15 Ohhh! Make it stop!
chandler_bing I am trying!
joey_tribbiani Get the ball, ready? Get the ball, get the ball! Well, you're cute, but you're not too smart!
joey_tribbiani Did I just throw this?
rachel_green Hi.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
rachel_green I accidentally packed these with my stuff. Who is this?
joey_tribbiani Oh, that's, uh, that's Phoebe's friend's dog. I don't know what his real name is, but I call him Mozzarella.
rachel_green Oh, well, you are so cute! I wish I could play with you more, but I've got to go to work! I hope I stop talking like this before my marketing meeting, yes I do. Yes I do. Bye-bye, Joey. Oh, I seriously can't stop it.
joey_tribbiani C'mere. Hey. C'mere. That's Rachel. She's the one who used to live here. Might as well be honest with you-we love her. But we can't have her. I really miss her. Well, hey, you understand, right? You're a guy. Well, you used to be.
monica_geller So what do you think?
monica_geller I've still got it!
chandler_bing Why did you get me this?
monica_geller What is it?
chandler_bing It's yelling...bleeding...dilating. Oh, the dilating
monica_geller Is this the video of the baby being born? Sweetie, this is Phoebe's. Why were you even watching it?
chandler_bing I thought...maybe...you got me porn for Valentine's Day.
monica_geller Chandler, if you thought I was going to get you porn for Valentine's Day... you were right! Apparently, it's about a young girl who moves to the big city, you know, in search of stardom, but ends up having sex with a lot of guys! Yeah, it got four starts! Oh, wait a minute. Those aren't stars. Anyway, you want to take a look?
chandler_bing Well, I'm not really in a sexy mood right now.
monica_geller Honey, what's going on?
chandler_bing Well, remember the first time we saw Jaws?
monica_geller Mm-hmm.
chandler_bing How long it took to go back in the water?
monica_geller Chandler, we can't let this tape wreck Valentine's Day!
chandler_bing You don't know. You didn't see it.
monica_geller Child-birth, it's a natural thing! It's beautiful.
chandler_bing Oh, beautiful? Really? Beautiful? You think this is beautiful?
monica_geller Oh! Oh, my God! No wonder my mother hates me!
chandler_bing See, honey, there's-
monica_geller Don't touch me!
mona Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey! So, how was Atlantic City?
mona Good.
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
mona I brought you back a present.
dr_ross_geller Wha-? Oh, come on. You didn't have to-saltwater taffy?! Thanks! This is interesting. You know, most people think this is made with sea water, but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water. That's not interesting.
mona I think it's interesting.
dr_ross_geller I do too! I missed you!
mona I missed you, too! So, how was your week?
dr_ross_geller Oh, it was good! It was good. Actually, the baby started kicking!
mona How exciting!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! I know! It was. Oh... the only sad thing is I wasn't around when it happened for the first time.
mona Oh no.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm missing out on all this other stuff, too. So, Joey suggested Rachel move in with me.
mona Yeah right!
dr_ross_geller What?
mona Joey cracks me up! It's like, 'Yeah, why don't you have your ex-wife move in with you? That wouldn't be awkward at all!'
dr_ross_geller Huh...uh-huh.
mona Huh, could you imagine. I go away for a few days, and come back, and my boyfriend is living with some woman he got pregnant!
mona So, what'd you tell him?
dr_ross_geller Just a second!
phoebe_buffay How could you not tell Mona that Rachel is living with you?
dr_ross_geller I don't know, she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea! Um, plus, she, uh, she got me taffy!
phoebe_buffay Taffy, really? I've never had any.
dr_ross_geller Ever?!
phoebe_buffay Well, I think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats. Thank you! So what, you're just never going to tell her?
dr_ross_geller Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner. Do all this romantic stuff, and then, just when she thinks I'm the best boyfriend in the world, then I'm going to tell her that my pregnant ex-girlfriend is living with me.
phoebe_buffay If I haven't said it before: she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?
joey_tribbiani So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?
joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay Will you excuse us, we need to talk for a moment.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Oh, me, right!
phoebe_buffay He's miserable! What happened to him?
joey_tribbiani Nothing. We just talked about stuff.
phoebe_buffay What stuff?
joey_tribbiani Rachel stuff.
phoebe_buffay Oh...Joey, you bummed him out! This was the happiest dog in the world, and he spends half a day with you, and look at him!
joey_tribbiani He's breathing!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm, uh, going to pick up Mona. What have you got going tonight?
rachel_green Oh, I've got big Valentine's plans! I've got my Chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy!
dr_ross_geller Y'know, it's interesting! Most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact-
rachel_green Ross, we actually watched the documentary together.
rachel_green Ooh! My Chinese food! Let me get my cash!
dr_ross_geller Mona? What are-hi! What are you doing here? I'm, um, supposed to pick you up!
mona Change of plans, I made you a special Valentine's dinner! Surprise!
dr_ross_geller Ayyyayyyy!
rachel_green Oh, hey, Mona!
mona Hi! Hi. Hi, Rachel! What's she doing here?
dr_ross_geller I have no idea!
rachel_green I'll be watching TV if anybody needs me.
mona Seriously, what is she doing?
dr_ross_geller Uh...lately, she just likes hanging out here.
mona Why?
dr_ross_geller I think she's lonely.
mona Okay, but it's Valentine's Day!
dr_ross_geller I know.
mona Can't we just ask her to go?
dr_ross_geller No, no. She's way to emotional. And by emotional I mean crazy.
rachel_green I'm not here! That's just my Chinese food!
mona Oh, my God! She has food delivered here?
dr_ross_geller Mm-hmm. She's-she's emotional, but, but ballsy.
rachel_green You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to get in my sweats, and eat this in bed!
dr_ross_geller And you thought she was going to be in our way! So, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and I'll be right back. I've got a surprise for you.
mona You got another ex-wife back there?
dr_ross_geller Please start drinking!
rachel_green I'm just going to grab the phone.
mona Oh, Rachel! Wait! Hey, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, but, um... what are you doing?
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry! Do you need the phone?
mona No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?
rachel_green But, but, Mona, I live here.
dr_ross_geller Happy Valentine's Day!..Or something to remember me by.
monica_geller How long has it been this time?
chandler_bing 90 seconds.
monica_geller That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.
chandler_bing You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!
monica_geller Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?
chandler_bing I can do that.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.
monica_geller Oh, thank God!
chandler_bing Oh, I know!
monica_geller Come in!
rachel_green Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.
monica_geller Oh, my God.
chandler_bing Poor Ross.
chandler_bing Oh, great. We have to watch him do yoga in his underwear, but for this he closes the drapes!
monica_geller Rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see? It's here.
chandler_bing Oh, and we should warn you, before you watch it: don't watch it.
rachel_green Why? You saw it? Is it scary?
chandler_bing Well, let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself.
rachel_green Well, now, wait. Now I'm all freaked out. Come on, you guys will watch it with me.
monica_geller No, but I will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you!
rachel_green C'mon, seriously, you guys, you're not going to make me watch this alone!
monica_geller She's right...of course not. Honey, get the tape.
chandler_bing This reminds me of a very specific part of the tape. Okay, here we go.
rachel_green Okay. Ooh, my! Woah! Why is that baby torturing that woman?!
chandler_bing Why have I seen this thing three times?!
monica_geller It's...still beautiful.
rachel_green Uh! It's horrible!
monica_geller I know! I know, I'm so sorry for you!
rachel_green Oh, my God!
chandler_bing Wait, you guys, look!
rachel_green What? Did her ass explode?!
chandler_bing No, the baby's out! Look, look!
monica_geller Oh, look at those little fingers and toes!
chandler_bing And look how happy the mom is now!
monica_geller Oh...Rach!
rachel_green Oh, screw you guys, you don't have to do it!
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, man!
joey_tribbiani Hey, what's up?
dr_ross_geller Uh...Mona just dumped me.
joey_tribbiani Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?
dr_ross_geller Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?
joey_tribbiani Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?
joey_tribbiani Sort of.
dr_ross_geller Really?!
joey_tribbiani You don't have to seem so happy about it.
dr_ross_geller Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I...I d-
dr_ross_geller Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.
dr_ross_geller Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?
joey_tribbiani Forget about it. It's no big deal.
dr_ross_geller C'mon! Joey! What is it?
joey_tribbiani It's nothing.
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?
joey_tribbiani Okay, uh...sit down. Um... there's this woman that I like. A lot. But, uh...it can't happen.
dr_ross_geller She's not a Tribbiani?
joey_tribbiani No!
dr_ross_geller I knew it. So, is she someone from work?
joey_tribbiani Yes.
dr_ross_geller Well, uh, does she like you?
joey_tribbiani Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.
dr_ross_geller Why not?
joey_tribbiani Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?
joey_tribbiani No. I don't think so.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Um... is he a good guy?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, he's the best.
dr_ross_geller Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Joey, it's worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.
joey_tribbiani I do! So much! I can't stop thinking about her! I can't sleep, I-
dr_ross_geller Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen to you, huh? You owe it to yourself.
gunther Here's your warm milk.
dr_ross_geller I'm going to...uh...I'm going to, um, put the bourbon in it at home.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah.
dr_ross_geller Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.
joey_tribbiani It's Rachel.
rachel_green You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!
woman_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode15 I came to the big city to become a star! I'll do...anything to make that happen!
man_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode15 Anything?
rachel_green Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.
