ross Hello! What's this? Oh right its that girl's phone number. Yeah-yeah, there it is, just a phone number a really hot girl gave me. It's no big deal, I mean it is her home phone number, but... Whoa! Whoa-whoops, I almost lost this baby! Yeah, the lovely Amanda gives me her number and I-I go and drop it.
phoebe Thank you.
gunther Rachel?
rachel Yeah?
gunther When's your birthday?
rachel May fifth, why?
gunther Oh, I-I'm just making a list of people's birthdays.
ross Oh, mine's December...
gunther Yeah, whatever.
chandler Ohh, she's pretty. Pretty ahh, pretty girl, the pretty--she's pretty.
monica Just go up to her and ask her out. Oh, what's the worst thing that could happen?
chandler I could die.
ross Yeah, it's-it's tough being single. That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.
rachel Ross, you guys went out once. You took your kids to Chucky Cheese, and you didn't even kiss her.
chandler I tell people secrets. It makes them like me.
phoebe Oh.
chandler Hey!
monica Phoebe! You're sick, you shouldn't play. You should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
phoebe But I'm unemployed, my music is all I really have now. Well music, and making my own shoes. Pretty, huh?
chandler All right, I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna get shot down. Any advice?
monica Just be yourself. But, not too much.
chandler Wish me luck.
ross Good luck!
chandler Wish it! Hi. Hi, I-I was just sitting over there, and uhh, Chandler. My name is Chandler. Did I say that?
kathy No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.
chandler Uh Kathy, with K or a C?
kathy With a K.
chandler Oh-oh-hey!
kathy Wow! You are really good at this.
chandler Hey, come on, give me a break, I'm out on a limb here.
kathy I'm sorry, you're right, I apologize, but I should tell you that I'm waiting for a date. Oh, and there he is now.
joey Hey!
chandler Hey! Hey, hey-hey, hey.
joey Hey, I see you guys already met, huh?
chandler Yes-yes, I was just trying to figure out a way to uh, demonstrate how I could get my exceptionally large feet into my even bigger mouth.
joey Didn't I tell ya? Always showin' off.
phoebe Before I start, I just wanna say that umm, I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of Pepper People. Smelly cat, smelly cat. What are they feeding you? This chick sounds good. Smelly cat, smelly-- Hey Gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
chandler Hi!
kathy Hi.
chandler Jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, I didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
kathy I'm sorry, it's just this Ernie Cofax thing on in a few minutes I wanted to watch.
chandler Oh my God! That's why I got up too!
kathy You're kidding! Oh, I love him.
chandler Hey, listen, I'm sorry about this afternoon, y'know, if I would've known you guys were... I never would've...
kathy Oh please!
chandler So ah, Joey tells me you two met in acting class.
kathy Yeah, they teamed us up as partners. Joey picked three scenes for us to do; all of them had us making out.
chandler That's a good thing actually, because ah, he used to have me rehearse with him.
kathy Oh-oh-oh-oh!
chandler Is it on?
kathy No, but this wonder broom is amazing!
chandler Hey!
kathy Oh my God!
chandler Oh! It's on! It's on!
chandler There we go little fella.
kathy What about the duck?
chandler Well the duck can swim.
kathy Oh, jeez.
phoebe My sticky shoes, my sticky-sticky shoes, why do you stick on me, ba-a-by! Thanks for the lights honey.
all Way to go, Phoebe!
monica That cold makes you sound so great.
phoebe It's fun, God I love how sexy I am.
joey Oh, Kath, we should get going. We're going to by hamsters.
all Ooh, that's great, I love those little guys.
kathy No, no, it's not like that. I, I work for a medical researcher.
rachel Well, have fun!
kathy Okay.
phoebe Well, I think it's great that the medical community is finally trying to help sick hamsters.
monica Y'know what, I like Kathy.
chandler Oh yeah, me too, she's so cool and pretty.
rachel Yeah, she's...
chandler She's smart and funny, y'know? We were up all last night talking, she said the funniest thing about--what?
rachel You love her.
chandler No, I don't.
phoebe Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.
ross Come on, Pheebs lay off him.
chandler Thank you, Ross.
ross Yeah, he's a little sensitive right now, `cause he's so in love.
chandler All right.
all Ohh!
chandler All right.
monica Ooh, umm, oh Kathy! Kathy, I love you! Oh!
phoebe So, I need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
monica Oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
phoebe Uh-huh. Oh, yeah, I could write about the time my hair did that "Woo-hoo" thing.
ross Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey.
ross So I'm going over to Amanda's tonight!
monica Rachel's not here.
ross Oh.
monica How's it going with her?
ross Great, actually. I'm thinking tonight, maybe the night. Yeah, I mean ah, the kids are gonna play together and then when they're asleep, I'm thinking Amanda and I break open a bottle of wine, and do a little "playing" ourselves.
rachel Hi guys! This is Josh. Josh, these are my friends, and that's Ross.
monica Hi, Josh.
phoebe Hi.
josh Dudes.
monica So, did you play in college?
josh Oh, I still do. Next year, I hope to make varsity though.
rachel Ross, didn't you ah, play soccer in High School? Oh no wait, that's right. You just organized their game schedules on your Commodore 64.
josh Well, it's getting late, I've got to get to the game, so I'm gonna... head.
rachel Okay. I'll miss you.
josh Dope!
phoebe Wow, cute one!
monica Very!
rachel I know, isn't he great? It's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know? There's nothing boring about him, and ah, I bet he's never set foot in a museum.
ross Well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
rachel Y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
ross Oh!
rachel What was that?
ross Monica knows.
monica It's this dumb thing that Ross made up `cause he was trying to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger, without actually having to give it. I remember I cried the night you made it up, `cause it was the first time that I realized that I was actually cooler than my older brother.
ross Well, I'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, I'll just_ head.
phoebe Yeah, I should go to, `cause I'm playing in one hour. Hey, you guys should come hear me, ooh hear me. Ooh, My sticky shoes--eww! Eww! I lost my sexy phlegm!
amanda Hi!
ross Hi!
amanda Hi Ben!
ross Wow! You-you look great!
amanda Thanks!
ross Okay! Hey Tommy.
amanda I am so glad that you could come over tonight.
ross Oh no-no-no, it's my pleasure.
amanda Okay, well, my cell phone number is right here on the counter, please help yourself to anything in the fridge.
ross What?
amanda I appreciate this soo much, I've been trying to go out with this guy for like a month.
ross I-I-I...
amanda Oh, I don't mean to be a square, but I'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep? Oh uh, thanks for this, I hope I can do the same for you sometime.
ross Who wants to make some long distance calls?
chandler Kathy! Kathy! Hi!! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Fetch! Fetch it! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy! Kathy.
kathy Hey, Chandler! What are you doing here?
chandler Oh, I just wanted to say, "Hey!"
kathy Hey!
chandler Okay.
monica Oh come on! You're making it sound worse than it actually was.
ross Her date tipped me ten dollars.
ross Pheebs, what are you doing?
phoebe Okay, I wanna be sexy again so I'm trying to catch a cold. It should be easy, supposedly they're pretty common.
monica Phoebe, you'll catch pneumonia.
chandler Okay. You were right. I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.
phoebe What?!
ross Are you serious?
phoebe Well, how-how-how is that possible? You barely know her!
chandler I don't know. I can't--I just, I can't get her out of my head. Y'know? I mean, I'm a very bad person. I'm a very, very bad person. I'm a horrible person. No you're not Chandler! We still love you Chandler!
monica Oh gosh, Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.
phoebe You mean you stole it! Don't cover your mouth when you do that!
joey Hey.
kathy We were just talking about you.
chandler Really?!
joey Yeah-yeah, I told her about the time you got drunk and fell asleep with your head in the toilet.
chandler Right in there!
chandler 99...100! Ready or not, here I come! All right, let's go over the concept one more time.
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey guys. Listen uh, you wanna get some dinner with me and Kathy tonight?
chandler Ohh, umm, y'know what, I already ate.
joey It's 4:30.
chandler Y'know I had a big meal on Monday, y'know. So that's just gonna get me straight through the week.
joey Okay, I see what's going on here.
chandler You-you do?
joey Yeah! You don't like Kathy.
chandler You got me.
joey Yeah, you've been avoiding her ever since we started going out. Look, I made an effort to like Janice, now I think it's your turn to make an effort to like Kathy by going out to dinner with us. Right?
chandler Yeah. Right.
joey Good, and hey! My treat. But that's only because you're not eating anything, right?
chandler Okay.
monica Ross isn't here.
rachel Oh. Stop it!
josh So I'll see you at the party? Beer's beer man, 24, 7!!
rachel Yeah! I am soo gonna marry that guy. Ohhh!
monica What?
rachel I think he's stealing from me.
monica Why?
rachel Because he's stealing from me!
phoebe Hi! It's me. And soup. Hey, I just saw Josh, he looks so yummy in your leather jacket.
rachel Ughh!
phoebe Here, now I don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup. And there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
monica Thank you so much Phoebe.
phoebe Sure.
monica What are you doing with those?!
phoebe But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.
monica Sorry, Phoebe.
phoebe It's okay. How's the soup?
monica Umm.
monica Ohhhh!! Gross!!
kathy Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!
joey Is she great or what?
kathy So? Huh? What do you think?
chandler Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.
kathy Not your type?! She's gorgeous!
chandler Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.
kathy Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!
chandler Uhh, no-no thanks.
kathy Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.
chandler Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer.
joey I'll be right back. What was that?
chandler What?
joey Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.
chandler Hey, look, what do you want from me?
joey I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.
chandler I am pretending.
joey Well then, do it better!
chandler Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!
joey Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.
ross Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?
monica No, sorry.
rachel Well where's Amanda?
monica Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?
rachel I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.
monica Ross, cough drops, please?
ross At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.
rachel Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.
ross You see Amanda and I have a very special...
monica You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!
rachel Ohh, that is soo sad.
monica And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'
rachel Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it!
monica That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!
ross Fine.
rachel Sorry.
ross Here. At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.
rachel Y'know...
phoebe Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. Does it even work without my sexy voice?
gunther I like it.
phoebe Gunther, kiss me.
gunther What?
joey Hey! Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?
chandler Can I sleep on your couch?
phoebe And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.
gunther Rachel?
rachel Yeah.
gunther I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_
rachel No!
gunther Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.
rachel Okay.
gunther So umm, are we cool?
rachel Okay.
gunther I knew you'd understand.
