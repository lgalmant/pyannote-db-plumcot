monica So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
all Ohhh.
monica What?
ross Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
monica You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
ross Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
joey Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
ross Yeah.
phoebe Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
monica Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
monica Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
chandler Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
ross I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
monica Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
joey Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
phoebe Why not her?
joey Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
chandler Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
monica Joey that is horriable.
joey Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
phoebe I'm sorry, I didn't know.
joey I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
ross Hi honey, how did it go?
rachel Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
chandler Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
rachel Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
monica So what happened?
rachel My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
phoebe Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
monica Well, how bout just her mom?
chandler Why her mom?
monica Cause I already invited her.
phoebe Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
joey Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
phoebe Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
monica Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
chandler Excuse me?
monica It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
joey Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
monica Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
mr_greene What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
monica No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
mr_greene Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
monica No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
mr_greene I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
chandler This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
mrs_greene Hi Monica.
monica Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
chandler So, basically just a Chinese guy.
joey Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
mr_greene Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
mrs_greene Well, my goodness, what was that?
monica Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
mrs_greene You thought I was Rachel?
chandler Yes because uh, you look so young.
phoebe And because you're both, you know, white women.
mrs_greene Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
chandler NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
mrs_greene Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
phoebe Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
monica Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
chandler Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
joey Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
monica So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
chandler Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
monica Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
joey Right this is staging.
chandler Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
joey This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
chandler Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
monica Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
chandler Ok, they're coming, shhh.
rachel Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
ross Thanks for being born.
rachel Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.

chandler Well, we could count again.
rachel I can't believe this is happening.
ross You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
rachel I do.
ross That's who.
chandler Look, are you gonna be ok?
rachel Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
chandler Well, actually just one birthday flan.
rachel What?
chandler It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
chandler Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
joey Quick volleyball question.
chandler Volleyball.
joey Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
chandler Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
girls_voice Dennis.
chandler Ok, that's me.
rachel Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
ross Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
rachel Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
monica Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
ross Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
mr_greene It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
ross I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
monica Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
gunther I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
monica No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.
phoebe Listen if you wanna go, just go.
gunter No, she'll yell at me again.
phoebe Alright, I can get you out.
gunther What?
phoebe Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.
mr_greene I think I need a drink.
ross Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?
mr_greene Scotch.
ross Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

mr_greene I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
ross No. no.
mr_greene Whad'ya mean no?
ross No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
mr_greene Get my glasses too.
ross All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
monica Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
phoebe Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
monica What? I don't see anything.
phoebe Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
mrs_geller Ross, whose glasses are those?
ross Mine.
mrs_greene You wear bi-focals?
ross Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
mrs_greene Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
rachel Well those are very popular frames.
ross Neil Sedaka wears them.
guy I hear you can get people out of here.
mrs_greene Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
rachel Yeah, like a chimney.
ross Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
mr_greene Are you wearing my glasses?
ross Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
mr_greene Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
ross Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
phoebe Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
girl_1 What about my friend Victor?
phoebe No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
girl_1 Alright, let me just get my coat.
phoebe There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
girl_1 Is it true they have beer?
phoebe Everything you've heard is true.
monica Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
monica You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
gunther Um
phoebe Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
monica Phoebe.
phoebe Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
monica Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
rachel You want me to see a therapist?
mrs_greene Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
rachel Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
mr_greene Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
rachel Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
mrs_greene You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
mr_greene You work and you work and you work on a boat...
mrs_greene He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
mr_greene ..and you sand it and you varnish it...
mrs_greene ..but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
mr_greene ..and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
mrs_greene ..the scotch and the cigarettes...
mr_greene ..and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
mrs_greene ..I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
mr_greene ..what the hell does she want with half a boat...
chandler Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
rachel This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
chandler Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
rachel Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
chandler Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
rachel It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
chandler I, I know.
monica Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
mrs_greene Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
monica Ok will do. So glad you came.
mrs_greene I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
monica Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
rachel Oh ok.
mrs_greene Happy birthday sweetie.
rachel Ok.
joey Ahh, you drive safe.
mrs_greene Ross, what're you doing.
ross I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
chandler Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
mr_greene To get my coat.
guys No no no.
mr_greene Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
chandler Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
phoebe Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
mr_greene I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
phoebe Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
joey Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
mrs_greene Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
monica Thank you.
monica Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
chandler Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
joey Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
monica Ok, that's enough.
phoebe Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
rachel Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
