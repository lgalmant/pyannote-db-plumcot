phoebe Oh Willie's still alive!
chandler What are you guys doing?
monica Oh, my mom called, they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the local paper, so we're looking for a good picture of us.
chandler Oooh, I'm afraid that does not exist.
monica That's not true, there are great pictures of us!
chandler No, there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who's going like this
phoebe Oh my God! That's the creep that you're with at the Statue of Liberty.
chandler I don't know what it is, I just can't take a good picture.
monica Oh, here's a great one.
chandler Yeah, I'm not in that.
monica I know, but look at me all tan.
phoebe Hey, why don't you guys go, get portraits done by a professional photographer.
monica That's a good idea! I bet they have one of those wind machines! Y'know
phoebe Yeah that's great! Next to that, Chandler won't look so stupid.
monica Chandler what do you say?
chandler All right, but I should warn you, I'm not going. I'm going.
ross Dude, that reverse lay-up! Oh
chandler How about those three pointers?
ross Amazing!
chandler And those guys were this close to lettin' us play this time too.
rachel Hey look-look, Phoebe's talking to uh, Cute Coffeehouse Guy.
ross Oh, you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy, we call him Hums While He Pees.
chandler Yes, and we call Ross Lingers In The Bathroom.
phoebe Hey you guys, Hums While He Pees just asked me out!
rachel Hey, I thought that guy was married.
phoebe He is! But he's getting divorced-Ross! Maybe you know him.
ross It's not a club.
rachel Phoebe, if this guy's going through a divorce, is it such a good idea to start going out with him?
ross Hey, divorced men are not bad men!
chandler They have that on the napkins at the club.
rachel Oh, I gotta get back to work.
phoebe You don't have to be back for a half-hour!
rachel Yeah but, my assistant Tag does sit-ups in the office during lunch. Ohh! I could just spread him on a cracker.
chandler Rach, if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him? I mean y'know you can't date him right?
rachel Oh no, I know that. I know that. Although, we made a joke that we spend so much time together he should call me his work wife.
ross Soon he'll be able to call you, that lady he knew who got fired.
rachel I am not gonna get fired, because I'm not gonna act on it.
phoebe So you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone else?
rachel Why? Is he? He is! Isn't he? He's dating that slut in marketing!
ross Maybe I should open a divorced men's club.
chandler Dude that is so sad.
ross I could put uh-uh a basketball court in the back.
chandler Could I play?
rachel Oh, no sit-ups today Tag?
tag I just did them.
rachel Oh, well drop and give me ten more!
tag What?
rachel Uh, I-I had a drink with lunch. Did those cost reports come in?
tag Yeah, I filled them out last night?
rachel Oh, great could you make me four copies of those?
melissa Hey Rachel!
rachel Ahh, hi! Hi! Melissa, what's up? I'm just uh, about to umm, go out to the store to get some stuff to put in my backpack. Y'know, like dried fruit and granola and stuff. What's up?
melissa Umm, is Tag here?
rachel No. Why?
melissa Oh, I was gonna talk to him about doing something tonight.
rachel Really?! Got a little crush on Tag there do ya?
melissa Well, we've been flirting back and forth, but I was hoping that tonight it would turn into something a little more than that.
rachel Okay, whoa-whoa easy there Melissa! This ain't a locker room, okay? But, y'know I remember him saying that-that he had plans tonight.
melissa Oh no!
rachel Oh yeah. All right, back to work.
melissa Hey! Isn't that Tag's backpack.
rachel Yeah Melissa, I don't want to be known as the uh, office bitch, but I will call your supervisor.
the_photographer Great! That's great Monica! Great! Now, Chandler, you want to give us a smile?
chandler Okay.
the_photographer I'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable?
chandler No, I am.
monica Chandler, listen to me sweetie, I know you can do this. Okay? You have a beautiful smile.
chandler I do?
monica Yeah! All right, maybe you don't have to smile. Let's try something else. Let's try umm, try looking sexy.
chandler Okay.
monica Or not.
rachel Hi Joey! What are you doing here?
joey Uhh, well I've got an audition down the street and I spilled sauce all over the front of my shirt. You got an extra one?
rachel Yeah, sure. Umm...here.
joey Great. You got anything that's not Ralph Lauren?
rachel Yeah, I don't think so Joe.
joey All right, I guess this will be fine.
rachel Hey, listen umm, what-what are you doing tonight?
joey Nothing, why?
rachel How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? I'll pay.
joey Huh, Rach I got to say it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.
rachel I'm not asking you to go on a date with him!
joey Really? 'Cause I could kinda use the money.
rachel Joey, just-just he-he's new in town and I know he doesn't have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. I'll really appreciate it.
joey Yeah, okay.
rachel Yeah?
joey Sure, no problem. Ooh-Hey, donuts!
rachel Yeah!
joey Okay.
monica I know. Let's try a look...of far off...wonderment. Okay, we'll-we'll gaze into our future and we'll think about our marriage and the days to come. Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" Hey! Don't laugh at him! He's my drowning moron!
chandler Aww!
monica That's it! Take it! Take it! Take it!
ross I like this one. It seems to say, "I love you and that's why I have to kill you."
monica They can't all be bad. Find the one where you make your bedroom eyes. Ohh, there it is.
chandler Oh my God! Those are my bedroom eyes?! Why did you ever sleep with me?
monica Do you really want to pull at that thread?
phoebe I'm having a really good time!
hums_while_he_pees Me too! I'm sorry that guy in the subway licked your neck.
phoebe Ohh. No that's okay, he's a friend.
hums_while_he_pees Hey uh, I don't mean to be presumptuous but I have these two tickets to the ballroom dancing finals tomorrow night if you want to go?
phoebe Yeah, I... Well y'know I-I mean I missed the-the semi-finals, so I'd just be lost.
hums_while_he_pees I know it's really lame, but I got these tickets from my boss and-Oh no! No! No! My God!
phoebe Okay, don't freak out. I'll go.
hums_while_he_pees No it's... Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!
phoebe Okay, I know. Hold on. Hey Ross?
ross Yeah?
phoebe Yeah, umm that's Whitney , Kyle's ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can y'know divert her so that we can slip out?
ross What?! No!
phoebe Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals.
ross Look, I don't think so Pheebs. All right, I'll do it. But just because you're a friend.
phoebe Hi Ginger.
ross All right! I want my key back!
phoebe I don't have it!
ross It's right there!
phoebe Ugh, okay Sherlock!
ross Look, I'm sorry but you-you-you better go Pheebs.

ross Oh yeah-No-You're welcome. We'll talk about it later.
phoebe Okay.
ross Hi Whitney.
whitney Hi Ross! You ready for breakfast?
ross Yep. Okay.
phoebe Kyle's ex-wife? You were supposed to divert her not date her!
ross Hi! I'm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.
whitney Sure.
ross Okay. I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?
phoebe Watching ballroom dancing?
ross Yes! That's where we realized we were both super cool people!
phoebe Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.
ross Like what?
phoebe Like she's really mean, and she's over critical, and-and-No! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!
ross Okay.
phoebe And! She uses sex as a weapon!
ross Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast I'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.
phoebe You're still gonna go out with her?!
ross Yeah!
phoebe Well, didn't you just hear what I said?!
ross Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. Now, if you'll excuse me
phoebe No listen to me! She is crazy!
whitney Uh, your door isn't sound proof.
phoebe You see? Nothing is good enough for her!
tag Good morning.
rachel Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night?
tag Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game.
rachel Ohh that's nice.
tag Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!
rachel Wo-women? You mean like old women?
tag Well kinda old, like 30.
rachel Oh.
tag And I never used to be able to just talk to girls in bars, but I got like 20 phone numbers last night.
rachel That's great! Wow man, so Joey must've really taught you some stuff huh?
tag A little.
rachel Yeah?
tag How you doin'?
joey See? That's a great smile! Easy. Natural. Now, pretend I have a camera. You're changing it!
chandler I can't help it!
joey All right, all right, all right, all right, you wanna know what I do when I take resume shots?
chandler Borrow money from me?
joey Okay, first-first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous. I look down , look down, keep looking down; then I look up. See? All right, now you try. Look down , you're looking down, keep looking down
chandler Why is there jelly on your shoe?
joey I had a donut.
rachel Hi!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
rachel So uh, heard you had some fun with Tag last night.
joey Yeah! That guy's all right!
rachel Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.
joey What?
rachel Y'know, all the women.
joey Hey well, you can't teach someone to be good with women. Y'know, that's why I never had any luck with Chandler.
chandler I'm right here!
rachel All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, it's just-And I know he's my assistant and I can't date him-but it just bothers me, all right?!
joey Hey! No-no-no-no, you can't take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!
chandler I'm still right here!
rachel All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!
joey What?!
rachel I just don't want him to meet anybody until I am over my crush-And I will get over it. It's-it's not like I love him, it's just physical! But-I mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!
joey I know, Monica told me.
chandler Did you have a crush on me, when you first met me?
rachel Yeah. Sure.
chandler Can you people not see me?!
rachel So, will you talk to him?
joey I don't know Rach.
rachel Oh, come on! I'll give you ten free Ralph Lauren shirts.
joey One! No ten! You said ten! You can't take that back!
tag Hey Joey, you wanted to talk to me?
joey I don't know. You uh, you got something for me?
tag Oh, yeah, this is from Rachel.
joey Ten. Okay. Now Tag there's such a thing as to many women.
tag Really?
joey Yeah, for you!
monica Hey! There you are!
chandler There I am!
monica Are you okay?
chandler Yeah, Joey said I uh, I needed to relax so he gave me an antihistamine.
monica What?!
chandler Yeah, and then I fell asleep on the subway and went all the way to Brooklyn. Brooklyn is f-far!!
monica Chandler, what were you thinking?
chandler I don't know, but don't worry, don't worry, because I know how to take a picture now. Okay, see? Look down , look down, look down
monica Chandler?
chandler Yeah!
phoebe Hi.
ross Hi.
phoebe So, how are things going with crazy? Has she cooked your rabbit yet?
ross Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okay-and F.Y.I she must've shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
phoebe Yeah well, maybe she should've spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.
ross Well, I don't think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe that's just because I am not emotionally unavailable!
phoebe You think he's emotionally unavailable?
ross I think he can be.
phoebe Well, maybe he wouldn't be she didn't bring the office home every night!
ross Well, excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life!
phoebe Yeah well, she certainly knew what she was doing New Year's Eve 1997.
ross I knew you were gonna throw that in my face!! That was three years ago! She apologized and she apologized! What more do you want?!!
phoebe We want the last six years back!!
ross So do we!! So do we!! I'm sorry you had to see that.
tag Good morning Rachel.
rachel Hi! Thanks, hey so uh what'd you do last night?
tag Went out with Joey.
rachel Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?
tag No. We had a really good talk. I don't think I'm gonna do that bar scene anymore.
rachel Wow! I did not see that coming.
tag It's just not really who I am. Y'know, I've always been happier when...Why am I telling you this? You don't care about this stuff.
rachel Oh no, yes I do! I do! I mean, come on go on, you were, you were saying I am happier when uh, y'know?
tag When I'm in a relationship, I love having a girlfriend.
rachel Really?
tag Someone I can spoil, y'know?
rachel Sp-spoil?
tag Uh-huh! Let me ask you something?
rachel Uh-huh.
tag Do you believe that there is one perfect person for everyone?
rachel Well, I-I'm startin' too.
tag And if that person is already in your life, you should do something about it right?
rachel Yes! Hell yes!
tag All right then, it's settled.
rachel Okay.
tag I'm gettin' back together with my ex-girlfriend.
rachel I'd love to!
tag What?
rachel Hello?! Oh, yeah! This is gonna be a while. Excuse me. Yeah!
ross My God!
phoebe Oh, I'm sorry. Is that annoying? And speaking about being selfish in bed, how's Whitney?
ross Well maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was!
phoebe Oh he knows! For the most part.
kyle Oh hey! Good, you're both here.
whitney We kinda need to talk.
phoebe Both of you together?
ross Wh-what's up?
whitney Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing
kyle ...we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
ross Oh just say it Kyle!
kyle We're gonna give it another try.
phoebe What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
whitney I'm gonna work on that.
phoebe Oh right, because you're so capable of change.
ross Y'know, he hums when he pees!
whitney I do know.
ross It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.
whitney We're so sorry.
ross That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already.
phoebe Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass.
kyle Yeah, we're gonna go.
ross I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she did try to use sex as a weapon! Yeah, I hurt my back a little.
phoebe Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to.
ross Yeah, were better off without them.
phoebe And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!
ross Divorced men's club.
phoebe Potato, Potaato.
monica Hey guys check it out! My mom sent me the paper!
phoebe Ooh, let's see it!
