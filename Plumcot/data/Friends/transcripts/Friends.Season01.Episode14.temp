joey I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
ross She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
chandler Any contact?
ross She lent me an egg once.
joey You're in!
ross Aw, right.
woman Hi, Ross.
ross Hey.
chandler Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian-I don't think we need a third...
joey Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
ross An egg?
joey Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, "Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."
chandler I think it's winning.
ross I think it's insane.
chandler She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
joey Think it'll work?
chandler No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
monica You can not do this.
rachel Do what, do what?
monica Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
rachel No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
phoebe 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
monica But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
rachel Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
joey Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
chandler Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
joey No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
chandler Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
joey Pathetic mess? I know, but-come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
ross Hi. She said yes.
chandler Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh?
joey How do I look?
chandler Oh, uh, I... don't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
lorraine Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
chandler ..And what did you bring?
lorraine She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
chandler Janice?
janice Oh.... my.... God.
chandler Hey, it's Janice.
chandler Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
joey No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
chandler Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
joey Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
chandler I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
rachel Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
monica Which one was Pete Carney?
rachel Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. "Was it good for you?"
monica Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-"I-win"-guy. "I win! I win!" I went out with the guy for two months-I didn't get to win once.
rachel How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
monica I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
phoebe I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
monica There's more beer, right?
phoebe Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
rachel Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
phoebe Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
monica Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
phoebe Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
rachel Or?
phoebe Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
monica Burning's good.
rachel Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
lorraine You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
joey Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
janice By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
chandler That's OK.
janice Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
joey We can't do that.
chandler What? What can't you do?
joey Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
joey Uh, we might be leaving now.
chandler Tell me it's "you and me" we.
joey She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
chandler Ok, you can not do this to me.
joey You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
lorraine Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
joey I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
chandler I hope she throws up on you.
chandler So...
janice Just us.
chandler Oh, what a crappy night!
janice Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
chandler Excuse me. How ya doin'?
janice So, do we have the best friends or what?
chandler Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
janice I will go for that drink.
chandler You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
janice Each.
chandler That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know...
janice Happy Valentine's Day!
janice Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
chandler No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
janice Kiss me!
monica Oh, Chandler, sorry.
monica Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
janice Hi, Monica.
chandler Ok, well, this was very special.
monica Rach, come see who's out here!
rachel Oh my god. Janice, hi!
chandler Janice is gonna go away now.
monica I'll be right back.
rachel Oh, Joey, look who it is.
joey Whoa.
chandler Oh, good, Joey's home now.
janice This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
monica Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. He just happened to call.
janice Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
ross I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
kristin That's funny. Who are they?
ross The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
kristin You mean they're lovers.
ross If you wanna put a label on it.
kristin Wow, uh, anything else I should know?
ross Nope, nope, that's it.
ross Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo!
phoebe Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
monica All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
phoebe Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
rachel Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
monica Can we just start throwing things in?
phoebe Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK.
rachel Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
phoebe Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
monica Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
rachel Hey he's wearing a sweater.
monica No.
rachel_and_phoebe Eww!
rachel And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
monica Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
chandler How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
joey I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
chandler Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
janice Hello, funny Valentine.
chandler Hi, Just Janice.
janice Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!
joey If you don't do it, I will.
ross So, um, what do you do for a living?
kristin Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major.
carol Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you.
susan I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry.
ross Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
kristin I guess.
ross Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
carol Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine.
ross Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
fireman_no_1 What do we got there?
fireman_no_2 A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture-Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!
monica You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
fireman_no_3 It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
fireman_no_1 You're our third call tonight.
rachel Really?
fireman_no_2 Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.
janice I brought you something.
chandler Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever.
janice I had them made special.
chandler Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
janice That's fine.
chandler It is?
janice Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
chandler Oh no, you see, actually it is.
janice No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing.
chandler Oh, no I don't.
janice Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
chandler I did, but...
janice You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya.
chandler Call me!
carol It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
ross You did so. I swear, I swear- How long has she been in the bathroom?
carol Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.
ross Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
carol That could be it.
ross Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot.
carol Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
ross No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
carol Oh, I love you too. But...
ross No but, no but.
carol You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
ross That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
carol All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
carol Not her.
fireman_no_3 We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?
rachel So, um, will you bring the truck?
fireman_no_3 I'll even let you ring the bell.
rachel Oh, my god.
phoebe See, there you go, the cleansing works!
monica They're nice guys.
rachel Oh, they're firemen guys.
fireman_no_1 You guys tell them you were married?
fireman_no_2 No way!
fireman_no_3 Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!
