joey Hey!
ross Hi!
joey Who wants French toast?
ross Oh, I'll have some!
joey Good, me too. Eggs and milk are in the fridge. Thanks.
monica Oww!
chandler What's the matter honey?
monica I don't know, my hand feels weird. I guess it's because, I'm engaged! How long before it starts getting annoying?
phoebe It starts?
rachel Yeah, so let's get started on the wedding plans!
monica Okay!
chandler Already?!
rachel Yeah, we got a lot to do! We gotta think about the flowers, the caterers, the music
chandler Oh, I got some thoughts on that.
rachel Oh wait Chandler, too many cooks
ross Take from me, as the groom all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.
monica Okay!
chandler What in God's name is that?!
ross Oh my God, the wedding book?! I haven't seen that since the forth grade!
monica This baby has got everything. Take y'know, locations for instance. First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.
phoebe That is so smart! Break it off. Break it off now.
ross And that should conclusively prove that I had the idea for Jurassic Park first! Now let's take a look at
phoebe Hey! Ross!
ross Phoebe, oh my God! Wh-wh-what are you doing here?
phoebe I need to talk to you, it's pretty urgent. It's about Monica and Chandler.
ross Oh my God! Of course, of course. Umm, would you please excuse me for a moment? Umm, do you know each other's hometowns? Why don't you... Wh-what's going on?
phoebe Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, y'know? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?
ross Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
phoebe Nothing-Why?!
ross Phoebe, you said it was urgent!
phoebe Oh yeah it is! I'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.
ross Do you realize I have a classroom full of students?
phoebe Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude. Does anyone want to come to the movies?
monica All right, so I haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet, but tell me how this is for music.
rachel Okay.
monica All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.
rachel Aw.
monica A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.
chandler Well, you couldn't get them anyway. Ian doesn't plan anymore and Derrick... And Derrick is a name I shouldn't know.
joey Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? Y'know, something a little snugglyer?
chandler Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?
joey Well, the duck
rachel What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!
joey Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!
chandler Now, do I get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding?
monica Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!
chandler Okay.
monica Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?
chandler Centerpieces!
monica Yeah! Roses or Lilies?
chandler Definitely roses. Well, I just think they're a little more weddingy. But Lilies are the clear choice.
monica Oh my God! It's like one mind.
chandler Uh-huh!
joey Guys! Guys!! You gotta let me nap! Ugh, I'm gonna get cranky!
rachel Joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall!
joey Yes it is perfectly good, and it is not one of the places the duck got sick!
rachel What?!
joey All right, I'm gonna go!
rachel Now Joey, what did the duck do?!
joey I don't know! But he did not eat your face cream!
joey Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar?..wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!
ross Uh, Phoebe
phoebe Oh Ross, hi.
ross Phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.
ross Phoebe!
phoebe Okay, let's talk outside.
ross Phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment!
phoebe What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!
ross And they knew about it?
phoebe Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?
ross Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!
phoebe Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just don't know what the big deal is!
ross The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.
rachel Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?
joey Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?
rachel No.
joey Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?
rachel Joey, did you my face cream?
joey Where are you going? The vicar won't be home for hours.
rachel Joey, where did you learn that word?
joey Where do you think, Zelda?
rachel You found my book?!
joey Yeah I did!
rachel Joey, what-what are you doing going into my bedroom?!
joey Okay, look I'm sorry, I went in there to take a nap and I know I shouldn't have, but you got porn!
rachel Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.
joey You got porn!
ross Hello.
woman Hi, is uh Phoebe here?
ross Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.
woman Ohh great.
ross Can I, can I help you with something?
woman Well, I don't know. Are you a masseur?
ross Yes I am.
woman Great! Dad! Thank you so much, I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.
mrs_geller So Chandler, you're parents must've been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.
chandler Oh yeah, I should probably call them.
mr_geller I remember when we first got engaged.
chandler Oh, I don't think I ever heard that story.
monica Oh dad, really you don't need to
mr_geller Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant. I still don't know that happened.
mrs_geller You don't know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!
chandler What a sweet story.
monica Well, at least you're not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.
mr_geller What?! They wanted a scary story!
monica Anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. What?
mrs_geller You tell her Jack, I can't do it.
monica What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund don't you?
mr_geller We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.
monica I don't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!
mrs_geller We're sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 you'd pay for it yourself.
monica You bought the beach house when I was 23!
mr_geller Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you can't put a price on that sweetie.
mrs_geller We really do feel bad about this though.
mr_geller We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.
monica What about when I started dating Chandler?
mrs_geller Well it was Chandler! We didn't think he'd ever propose!
chandler Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.
monica I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!
mrs_geller We might still have some money, if your father didn't think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.
mr_geller It seemed like such a simple idea.
mrs_geller Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.
mr_geller All right, enough! I don't want to hear about it anymore! Good luck, Chandler.
ross Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.
monica I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?
chandler I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.
rachel Well what happened at dinner?
monica My parents spent the money for our wedding!
phoebe My God! What did you order?!
rachel Wait, but there's no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!
chandler Honey, it's gonna be okay.
monica No! No it's not! It's not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!
rachel No, y'know what? It's gonna be okay. I mean you don't have to have this rustic Italian feast. Y'know? And-and you don't need, you don't need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack.
chandler Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that we're gonna get married.
rachel Do you even understand what off the rack means?!
phoebe Look, why don't you just pay for it yourself?
monica How? I don't have any money.
chandler Well, I have some.
monica How much?
chandler Well, close to
monica Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!
rachel Well what?! How-how much is it?!
monica It's enough for wedding scenario eight.
rachel Ohh! Really?!
monica How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!
rachel Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.
chandler Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?
rachel_and_monica Ah, yeah!
chandler Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
phoebe Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.
monica This is the most special day of our lives.
chandler No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.
monica Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.
chandler Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.
monica You-you're gonna have to put your foot down?
chandler Yes, I am!
phoebe Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.
joey Hey Rach.
rachel Joey.
joey Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?
rachel Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.
joey No-no-no, I'm serious. You don't smell it? Something's on fire.
rachel Well no, I don't smell anything.
joey Oh, y'know what? It's probably just your burnin' loins.
ross Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?
rachel Nothing!
ross Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?
rachel Y'know, I can not believe you told him, Joey!
ross So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?
rachel Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you.
ross Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?
phoebe Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!
ross Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?
phoebe My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.
ross I gave him an extremely professional massage!
phoebe He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.
ross Okay, so it wasn't uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.
phoebe Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!
ross Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.
phoebe Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!
ross He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.
joey Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?
ross His daughter was hot.
joey Gotcha.
monica Hey.
chandler Hey.
monica Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
chandler Ehh.
monica Eh, you work for that.
chandler Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
monica You do?!
chandler Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.
monica Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
chandler Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
monica You thought about that?
chandler Yeah.
monica How many kids were we gonna have?
chandler Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
monica What else did you think about?
chandler Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
monica Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
chandler Sure you do.
monica No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.
chandler You sure?
monica Uh-hmm.
chandler I love you so much.
monica I love you. Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkin' about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.
chandler Oh yeah, totally!
monica Oh good.
joey Hello, Zelda.
rachel Who are you supposed to be?
joey The vicar!
rachel Do you even know what a vicar is?
joey Like a goalie, right?
rachel Yeah. Look Joey, it's enough all right?! You keep making these stupid jokes and this sleazy innuendoes and it's-I'm not-it's just not funny anymore!
joey All right, I'm sorry. Rach I-Rach I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry! Maybe I can make up for it by, taking you roughly in the barn.
rachel All right! Y'know what? That's it! You wanna do it?! Let's do it!
joey Huh?
rachel That's right, I wanna do it with you! I've been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.
joey I-I-I-I did?
rachel Yeah! Ohh, I've been waitin' so long to get on that body!
joey This body?
rachel Yeah that's right! Come on Joey; sex me up!
joey Hey-hey, you're startin' to sound like the butcher's wife there in-in chapter seven.
rachel Oh, come on now, don't keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because you're in for a rough ride!
joey I don't want to, I'm scared.
