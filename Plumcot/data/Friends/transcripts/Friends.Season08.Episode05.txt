monica_geller Okay, now this one is rare, this one is medium well! Now go-go-go! Hey Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey how was dinner?!
phoebe_buffay Dinner was good!
monica_geller Okay!
phoebe_buffay I'm just saying hi! Now I'm gonna go!
monica_geller Okay!
phoebe_buffay Oh, well hello there.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Hi.
phoebe_buffay I didn't see this on the menu.
monica_geller Uh Tim? This is Phoebe. Phoebe this is Tim, my new sous chef.
phoebe_buffay Oh, so you're Monica's boss?
tim Actually she's my-my boss. Sous is French for under.
phoebe_buffay Oh! I sous stand.
monica_geller Hey Tim? I need a calamari and a Caesar salad. And umm, could you get me the pesto?
tim Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Oh you...you made pesto?
tim Yes I did.
phoebe_buffay Would you say your pesto is the best-o?
tim I...I-I don't know, but I would say it's pretty good-o.
monica_geller All right, I still need a calamari and a Caesar salad.
tim I like your necklace.
phoebe_buffay I made it myself.
tim You are so talented.
phoebe_buffay Well, it's no pesto.
monica_geller All right, all right! Let's just cut to the chase, okay? You're single. You're single. He gets off work at eleven. She'll be waiting for your call. I'll give him your number if I can get one calamari and one Caesar salad!! I did not yell. I am not putting a dollar in the jar.
mr_franklin Wow Bing! Burning the midnight oil.
chandler_bing You know me sir. Oh ah, I do have a question for ya. Do you know how I get around the office computer network so I can access the really good Internet porn?
mr_franklin You're a joker Bing.
chandler_bing What's funny about that?
dr_ross_geller Hey! Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
chandler_bing Hey that's okay. So, where do you want to go?
dr_ross_geller Oh ah, I think you know where I want to go.
chandler_bing The Hard Rock Caf√°?
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
chandler_bing Again?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!!
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you, I like the food!
chandler_bing You like the Purple Rain display! Hey Bob.
bob Hey Toby! Have a good night.
dr_ross_geller Did that guy just call you Toby?
chandler_bing Yeah, he thinks that's my name.
dr_ross_geller Well, why don't you correct him?
chandler_bing Oh it's been going on way to long now. Y'know, I mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway, so I didn't say anything. And then the next time he said, "Hey Toby, do you want a donut?" And I-I wanted a donut. And now it's five years later, the donut's gone and I'm still Toby.
dr_ross_geller Five years?! Chandler you have to tell him!
chandler_bing No! That would be so awkward! Look-Besides, we work in different departments. He's on the sixth floor y'know? So he calls me Toby once in a while. What's the big deal? It could be worse, it's not like he's calling me Muriel.
dr_ross_geller Muriel. Wh-why would he call you Muriel? Oh my God! Chandler M Bing? It's not just an M, your middle name is Muriel!!
chandler_bing Shh! It is a family name!
dr_ross_geller Chandler Muriel Bing. Boy, your parents never gave you a chance did they?
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Drake, I've discovered the reason for all your headaches and memory loss.
dr_drake_ramoray#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 What is it?
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Apparently your brain transplant was not entirely successful. It seems your body is rejecting Jessica's brain.
dr_drake_ramoray#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Is it serious?
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Not if we extract tissue from the original host body, synthesize antibodies, and introduce them into your system, which could stop it from rejecting the brain.
dr_drake_ramoray#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Well that sounds simple enough, let's just do that.
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 We would, but when we went to exhume Jessica's body, it was gone.
director#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Cut! Very nice people!
joey_tribbiani Okay, let me just get changed and we can go to dinner.
rachel_green Well don't-What happened to Jessica's body?!
joey_tribbiani I'm not telling, you'll have to see it on TV!
rachel_green You don't know do you?
joey_tribbiani No, couldn't care less.
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Hey good scene man.
joey_tribbiani Hey you too!
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode05 Alright.
joey_tribbiani What? You weren't in it.
rachel_green Oh!
joey_tribbiani Oh sorry. Uh-uh, Kash?
kash_ford Yes?
joey_tribbiani This is my friend Rachel. Rachel, Kash, Kash, Rachel.
rachel_green Hi.
kash_ford Hey! How come I haven't seen you here before?
rachel_green Well, Joey probably thinks I'll just embarrass him. Y'know, he thinks I'm some kind of a soap opera nut-Which I'm not! I'm not. Although I do know that your uh, your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan. And uh, and that your-your dog's name is Wally. Well look at that, I'm just stroking your arm.
joey_tribbiani Here we go! Here we go!
rachel_green Oh, we're leaving. Bye Kash.
kash_ford Bye.
rachel_green Say hi to Wally.
phoebe_buffay Ooh Monica!
monica_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! I had the best time with Tim last night. He is so sweet! Oh, I can't wait to get sous-neath him.
monica_geller I...I have to fire him.
phoebe_buffay But why?!
monica_geller Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!
phoebe_buffay Well maybe he was just nervous, y'know you can be very intimidating. And besides I've met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two.
monica_geller Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.
phoebe_buffay But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?
monica_geller All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!
phoebe_buffay That's fair! Thank you so much. Thanks. Oops, it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too.
monica_geller I paid to have this done.
phoebe_buffay Love it!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Oh you know uh Kash, really liked you the other day. He said he thought you were charming.
rachel_green I thought I was a complete idiot.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him.
rachel_green Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?
joey_tribbiani I said no.
rachel_green What?!
joey_tribbiani What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
rachel_green Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?
joey_tribbiani I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
rachel_green Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?
joey_tribbiani Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great
rachel_green Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet 'em all!
chandler_bing Hey Bob.
bob Hey! How's my pal Toby doing today?
chandler_bing If I see him, I'll ask.
bob Toby!
mr_franklin Hey-hey! Bing? Was that Bob from six you were just talking too?
chandler_bing Yeah!
mr_franklin Oh then you know each other.
chandler_bing We're on a semi-first name basis.
mr_franklin What do you think of adding him to our team?
chandler_bing Bob? Ooh, working here with us? Everyday? Yeah, I don't know if he has what it takes.
mr_franklin Really? They love him down on six.
chandler_bing But this is eleven. It's almost twice as hard up here.
mr_franklin Okay, I hear you loud and clear. Bob will stay put.
chandler_bing I think it's best sir.
mr_franklin But we really do need to find someone up here. The work is starting to pile up. I've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.
chandler_bing Y'know what you should do, just toss 'em in the shedder and claim you never got 'em.
mr_franklin That's a good one.
chandler_bing What does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!
phoebe_buffay But
monica_geller No! No-no! He is totally incompetent. I called the chef who recommended him to me. He said, "Ha-ha! Gotcha!"
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.
monica_geller Why not?!
phoebe_buffay Because I'm dumping him today.
monica_geller What?! You said he was sweet!
phoebe_buffay He is sweet. He's too sweet. He calls me all the time. "So did-did you get home from work okay?" "Did-did you get out of the shower okay?"
monica_geller Just don't pick up your phone.
phoebe_buffay Then he comes over! "I'm so worried about you." Uck! Be a man!
monica_geller What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
phoebe_buffay You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.
monica_geller Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!
monica_geller Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!
phoebe_buffay Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.
monica_geller What do you mean?
phoebe_buffay Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!
monica_geller I wanted to do this days ago so I think I should go first.
phoebe_buffay All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!
bob Hey Toby, you got a sec?
chandler_bing Sure, what's up?
bob I just had a meeting, I was actually hoping to get transferred up here, but I just found out its not gonna happen. Apparently somebody thinks I'm not eleventh floor material. Say uh, who the hell is this Chandler?
rachel_green Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. "Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon," or "I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?"
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller So, what do you want to do tonight? There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelica that's supposed to be very powerful. Interested?
joey_tribbiani No. No. But I'll go see a normal person movie with ya.
dr_ross_geller Rach? You wanna come?
rachel_green Oh no, I can't. I got a date.
dr_ross_geller A date?
rachel_green Yeah. Why? Is that weird for you?
dr_ross_geller Why no, it's the opposite of weird. It's-it's uh, regular. It's-it's uh, it's mundane. It's actually uh, a little dull.
joey_tribbiani It's no Ukrainian film.
rachel_green Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!
dr_ross_geller A date?! She's-she's got a date?! With who?
joey_tribbiani I set her up with this actor on my show.
dr_ross_geller You set her up?!
joey_tribbiani No
dr_ross_geller Joey what-what were you thinking?!
joey_tribbiani Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!
dr_ross_geller Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?
joey_tribbiani Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.
dr_ross_geller A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!
joey_tribbiani Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?
dr_ross_geller Why don't they just jump out of an airplane?! Huh?! That-that's a fun date! Or burn each other with matches?! That's fun too! Whew!!
kash_ford Hey Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey Kash. Uh hey-hey this is Ross. Ross, this is Kash.
kash_ford Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hi. I-I hear you're going on a ferry tonight.
kash_ford Yeah.
dr_ross_geller A bit of a daredevil are we?
rachel_green Hey guys do you think this is too slutty-Hi Kash!
kash_ford Hey Rachel! You ready to go?
rachel_green Yeah! All right, I'll see you guys later.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Have a great time you guys.
rachel_green Thank you.
kash_ford Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Yes it is too slutty!
tim Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hi.
tim Oh, I'm so glad you called. I feel like it's always me calling you. So, what's up? Is everything okay with Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay It will be...in a minute. Listen, Tim you're a really great guy.
tim It's because I'm with you.
phoebe_buffay Aw. I'm just-I'm in a place in my life right now where I...I
tim Whoops. Sorry. This just in. Oh, it's 9-1-1 from the restaurant, that means Monica needs me right away.
phoebe_buffay Oh-oh no she doesn't! I know what that is. You can stay.
tim Awww, I'll miss you too Pheebs. And I will be holding you, right here.
joey_tribbiani So what movie do you want to see-And not another one I have to read. Okay? I get enough of that from books.
dr_ross_geller Books?
joey_tribbiani All right, car magazines, cereal boxes, but it's like enough!
dr_ross_geller Well, I tell you what. Why don't we uh, why don't we just stay here? Let's not see a movie, we'll just hang.
joey_tribbiani And just wait for Rachel to come back from her date?
dr_ross_geller Hey, if that's what you want to do I'm not gonna say no.
joey_tribbiani Dude! What is going on?!
dr_ross_geller I just...I have to find out how it went.
joey_tribbiani Why?
dr_ross_geller This guy could be my baby's stepfather!
joey_tribbiani They go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?! He's not you!
dr_ross_geller I just-I-I can't believe she's-she's dating?!
joey_tribbiani Well Ross, what did you think she was gonna do?
dr_ross_geller I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.
joey_tribbiani What do you mean?
dr_ross_geller It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.
joey_tribbiani That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!
dr_ross_geller No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.
joey_tribbiani Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?
dr_ross_geller It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.
joey_tribbiani Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.
dr_ross_geller No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?
joey_tribbiani I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.
dr_ross_geller No, it's not what I want either. I mean I-I can't force myself to fall in love with her again now.
joey_tribbiani That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I tell you what. Let's you and me go out and have some fun. Huh? Whatever you want. Come on!
dr_ross_geller We can still catch that Ukrainian film.
joey_tribbiani No, I said fun!
bob Hey Toby!
chandler_bing Hey Bobby.
bob It's Bob actually. Hey, you work up here, can you tell me where this Chandler Bing's office is?
chandler_bing Uhh yeah. Yeah, it's right, right down there. Right there, yeah. Can I ask you why?
bob I want to talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.
chandler_bing Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here.
bob Toby don't.
chandler_bing Bob!
bob Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
chandler_bing Well that puts me in a difficult position.
monica_geller Hey.
tim I got your page, is everything okay?
monica_geller Uh well that depends, how are things with Phoebe?
tim Oh it's great! It's great! Thank you so much for introducing us!

phoebe_buffay I'm breaking up with you!
tim What?
phoebe_buffay I'm, I'm breaking up with you.
monica_geller You're fired.
tim Why?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm just-I'm...I'm just not ready for a relationship right now.
monica_geller Yeah and-and I'm sorry too. But, well I just-I like things done a certain way and the chemistry's just not right.
phoebe_buffay Oh that's good, the chemistry thing for us too.
tim Wow! Umm, okay. Umm... I-I-I realize I came on a little strong but, it's only because I think you're so amazing. And uh, I-I just wanna, I just wanna tell you how much I appreciate you giving me an opportunity here because I-you're the most talented chef I've ever worked for. Anyway
monica_geller Tim wait!
tim Yeah?
monica_geller Umm, I think I spoke too quickly. There-there's a learning curve with this job and maybe we can try it again.
tim Really?
monica_geller Yeah.
tim Thank you so much! 'Cause I-I know I can do better!
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay And Tim I just wanna say, good luck here.
dr_ross_geller Hello.
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Well, how was the date?
rachel_green Well I'm alone and I just bought fifteen dollars worth of candy bars, what do you think?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. What happened?
rachel_green I made the mistake of telling him that I was pregnant.
dr_ross_geller Ah, he didn't uh, take it so well?
rachel_green Well better than you, but y'know still not what you want.
dr_ross_geller Oh?
rachel_green He got all weird and sputtery and then he said uh, "Yeah, I hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch."
dr_ross_geller He sounds swell.
rachel_green Doesn't he?
dr_ross_geller Hey, wanna...wanna a little cheering up?
rachel_green Yes.
dr_ross_geller Sit down.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Guess whose middle name is Muriel.
rachel_green Chandler M. Bing?
dr_ross_geller Yeah-ha!
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry about your date.
rachel_green Oh it's all right. I'm guess I'm just done with the whole dating thing. It's one more thing in my life that's suddenly completely different. This is hard.
dr_ross_geller Yeah I know. On the other hand in um, in about seven months you're gonna have something that you're gonna love more than any guy you've ever gone out with. Just wait. Wait until uh, wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger. You have no idea.
rachel_green Thanks sweetie.
dr_ross_geller You wanna, you wanna grab some coffee?
rachel_green Oh no, I think I'm gonna go home and eat ten candy bars.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I thought I cheered you up.
rachel_green Oh you did, there are twenty in here.
dr_ross_geller Right. Good night.
rachel_green Good night.
mona Ross?
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
mona Hey it's Mona! From the wedding.
dr_ross_geller Oh hi!
mona Hi!
dr_ross_geller Wow! Uh...how are you?
mona I'm good except umm, you still owe me a dance.
dr_ross_geller Oh that's right. Well uh, would you be interested in seeing a Ukrainian film?
mona Oh you're serious. Sure!
dr_ross_geller Great! Well umm
mona I think I might need one more cup of coffee.
dr_ross_geller Sure! Uh, let me get it for ya.
