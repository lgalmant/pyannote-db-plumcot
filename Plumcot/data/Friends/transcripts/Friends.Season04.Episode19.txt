dr_ross_geller Uh, I don't know, whatever.
emily_waltham I think it makes you look really dangerous.

emily_waltham Ohh, Ross, please!
dr_ross_geller One more day, seriously/
emily_waltham Don't do this to me, again. You'd know I'd stay here in a minute, but I'd really miss so much work, they'll fire me.

emily_waltham I wish I could.
dr_ross_geller Oh no. Don't, don't, don't start packing. Come on!
emily_waltham I don't think you understand packing. Look, I just don't want to leave it to the last minute. Last time I left in such a rush, I left my knickers here.

joey_tribbiani Oh come-look, when I was a kid my dad's company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasn't in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!
dr_ross_geller Hey, guys!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani We don't make enough fun of you already?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.

dr_ross_geller I like it, and Emily likes it, and that's what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?
joey_tribbiani Oh-no, don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.

dr_ross_geller Yeah!! Yeah!
chandler_bing Easy tiger.
dr_ross_geller I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, it's-it's so great. But at the same time I'm thinking, "Well, I'm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."
chandler_bing So what are you going to do?
dr_ross_geller Nothing! There's nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-she'd have to uh, move here. She should move here!
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller I could ask her to live with me!
chandler_bing Are you serious?
dr_ross_geller I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!
chandler_bing Because you've only known her for six weeks! Okay, I've got a carton of milk in my fridge I've had a longer relationship with!
dr_ross_geller Look guys, when I'm with her it's-it's-it's like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, y'know?
chandler_bing And I love the milk! But, I'm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! Joey, you say things now.
joey_tribbiani All right look, Ross, he's right. Emily's great, she's great! But this way too soon, you're only gonna scare her!
dr_ross_geller I don't want to do that.
joey_tribbiani No! You don't want to wreck it, you don't want to go to fast!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, no, you're right, I know, you're right, I'm not, I'm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys.
chandler_bing Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.
phoebe_buffay That's too hard. Too hard!
monica_geller All right boys, last chance for the tickets!
rachel_green Or I'll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.
chandler_bing No thank you.
joey_tribbiani Wait-wait-wait-wait! Come on! Come on, let's trade! The timing's perfect, I just clogged the toilet!
chandler_bing Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we can't leave in the small apartment after we've lived here! Didn't you ever read Flowers for Algernon?
joey_tribbiani Yes! Didn't you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didn't read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!
chandler_bing Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.
joey_tribbiani It's the Knicks!
chandler_bing Screw the Knicks!
joey_tribbiani Whoa!
chandler_bing I didn't mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.

joey_tribbiani Yeah, the Knicks rule all!
phoebe_buffay Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?
chandler_bing No. No. We're not gonna do that, y'know why? Because its not an even trade.
rachel_green All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?
joey_tribbiani Done!
rachel_green Let me finish.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
rachel_green I'm talking about a bet, winner takes all.

chandler_bing No!
monica_geller Oh, just do it!!
chandler_bing Op, op, I'm convinced!
joey_tribbiani Come on man, you know I'd do it for you! Because, you're my best friend.
chandler_bing All right, but you can't use that again for a whole year. I'm in.
joey_tribbiani All right!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?

dr_ross_geller Move in with me.
emily_waltham What?!
dr_ross_geller Don't be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say it's too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.
emily_waltham Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.
dr_ross_geller I know.
emily_waltham My job!
dr_ross_geller Well, so, you-you'll get a job here! I mean, I'm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!
emily_waltham Yeah, but it-it-it's my whole life-you come to England.
dr_ross_geller No, I can't. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I can't leave him. Isn't-you don't think there's any way?
emily_waltham Ohh, I don't think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future -and-and-and we were getting married or something.
dr_ross_geller What?
emily_waltham Oh no, no, right I shouldn't have said married. Uh, please don't go freaky on me. I didn't mean it. Well, I didn't say it; I take it back!
dr_ross_geller No, no, don't. Why don't we?
emily_waltham Why don't we what?
dr_ross_geller Get married.
emily_waltham You are mad!
dr_ross_geller No! No! I'm not! It's-it's-it's perfect! I mean it's better than you just-just moving here, 'cause it's us together forever, and that's-that's what I want.
emily_waltham We've only known each other for six weeks!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, who's-who's to say? Does that me we-we can't do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesn't it?
emily_waltham My parents are going to be really mad.
dr_ross_geller Is that-are you saying yes? Is that yes?

emily_waltham Yes.
emily_waltham Ohh, it's a bit small.
dr_ross_geller Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!
emily_waltham It was.
chandler_bing Those were like the best seats ever.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Y'know, kinda like a peace offering.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, that's very nice. Plus, y'know they were free and they're too small.
chandler_bing Oh. Oh, God!
joey_tribbiani Hey, want a beer? WHOA!!!!
chandler_bing I KNOW!!!
chandler_bing Open up! Open up! Open up!
monica_geller We'll discuss it, in the morning!

phoebe_buffay I had nothing to do with it. Okay, it was my idea, but I don't feel good about it.
chandler_bing We are switching back, right now!
monica_geller No, we're not! We're not leaving!
chandler_bing Well, you're gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, we're switching it back! There's nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani I don't want to move again!
chandler_bing I don't care, this is our apartment! And they stole-you stole it-our apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. I'm getting back right now!
rachel_green All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You can't offer anything to us!
rachel_green Let us keep the apartment and
monica_geller As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.

chandler_bing Good night.
joey_tribbiani Good night.
monica_geller Men are such idiots.
rachel_green Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?
phoebe_buffay That's so funny to think if you'd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.
monica_geller Yeah, let-let-let's pretend that's not true.
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Okay, scarf's done.
