ross So I told Carl, 'Nobody, no matter how famous their parents are, nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur.' But of course this went in one ear and out.....
rachel I love how he cares so much about stuff. If I squint I can pretend he's Alan Alda.
monica Oh good, another dinosaur story. When are those gonna become extinct?
chandler If I was a superhero who could fly and be invisible, that would be the best.
gunther What does Rachel see in this guy? I love Rachel. I wish she was my wife.
phoebe Who's singing?
ross Hey. When you guys were kids and you played Happy Days, who were you? I was always Richie.
monica I was always Joanne.
joey Question. Was ah, 'Egg the Gellers!' the war cry of your neighbourhood?
phoebe Ewww! Oh! It's the Mattress King!
joey Booo!!
chandler Don't look honey. Change the channel! Change the channel!
janice Wait! Wait! I wanna see this. After I divorce him, half of that kingdom is gonna be mine.
matress_king 'Despair fills the mattress showroom. My kingdom is suddenly without a queen. I'm so depressed I'm going to slash... my prices!! Check it out! Four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set! I'm going medieval on prices!
chandler What a wank!
janice Oh, I cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.
monica I know! And four ninety-nine for a pillow top queen set, who cares about the divorce, those babies will sell themselves. And I'm appalled for you by the way.
matress_king I'm close. I'm cheap. I'm the king.
rachel 'Okay. Okay, daddy we'll see you tomorrow night. Okay bye-bye.'
ross We?
rachel Are ah, having dinner with my Dad tomorrow night, I hope that's okay.
ross Oh shoot, tomorrow's not so good, I'm supposed to um, fall off the Empire State building and land on a bicycle with no seat. Sorry.
rachel Ross, my father doesn't hate you.
ross Please, he refers to me as 'wethead'.
rachel But honey he calls everybody by a nickname! Okay, look, I know, all right, just one dinner, please, just one night for me, please. I just want him to love you like I do. All right, well not exactly like I do, but, but, if you do come to dinner, I'll love you like I do in that black thing that you like.
chandler I'll go.
ross Fine.
rachel Thank you.
ross Hi Gunther.
gunther Yeah, we'll see!
joey Hey, you guys!
phoebe Hey!
joey Guess what?
ross What?
joey I got a gig!
all Yay!!
chandler See, that's why I could never be an actor. Because I can't say gig.
phoebe Yeah, I can't say croissant. Oh my God!
monica What's the part?
joey Well, it's not a part, no. I'm teaching acting for soap operas down at the Learning Extension.
ross Come on! That's great.
all Wow!
joey Yeah, yeah. It's like my chance to give something back to the acting community.
ross Y'know your probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.
joey I know!
phoebe Ugh! I don't know Monica. It feels funny just being here. I mean if you buy a bed from Janice's ex-husband, that's like betraying Chandler.
monica Not at these prices.
phoebe Hi. Y'know in England this car would be on the other side of the store. Woo!
monica Oh! Ohhhhh! Oh! Phoebe, come here. Aw, this is my new bed. You gotta feel this bad boy.
phoebe Eh, Monica it, it feels so weird, y'know, Chandler's your friend... Oh! Oh my God! Aw, all right take this bed, you can make other friends.
joey Good evening. I'm Mr. Tribbiani. And I will be teaching acting for soap operas. Now um, on my first day as Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives, I learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting, this does not mean acting again, it means, you don't have a line, but someone else just did. And it goes like this. Thanks, thanks, a lot. Oh, by the way, before I forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive. All right, moving right along.
joey Hi!
phoebe Hey! Ooh! How was teaching last night?
joey Oh it was great. Yeah, you get to say stuff like, 'Hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you, I dismiss you.'
phoebe Ooooh, nice.
joey Oh, and guess what, I got an audition for All My Children.
phoebe Oh, yay!
joey Yeah, it's this great part, this boxer named Nick. And I'm so, so right for it, y'know, he's just like me. Except he's a boxer, and has an evil twin.
phoebe Oh.
guy Dom da-da dom! Here ye! Here ye! Delivery from the Mattress King. You Miss Geller?
phoebe Okay.
guy Sign here.
phoebe Oh, do I have a middle name. All right Monica Velula Geller. It's that bedroom there.
joey Hey, Monica bought a bed from the Mattress King?
phoebe Yeah, so please, please, please, don't say anything to Chandler.
joey You want me to lie to Chandler?
phoebe Is that a problem?
joey No.
phoebe Oh, hey, hey Nick the boxer let's see what you got. All right ya, put 'em up. Come on.
joey Hey, you're ah, pretty good at this.
phoebe Yeah, well I had to learn, I was staying at the Y and some off the young men weren't acting Christian enough.
joey Ahh!
joey Hey now!
joey Hey!!! Oww!! And I'm bleeding.
phoebe Oh! Oh! Oh!
joey Okay, great.
phoebe Wow! And I'm a vegetarian! All right, all right, well I'm sorry, we'll put some ice on it.
joey Okay.
phoebe 'Kay, put your head back.
joey All right. I can't see.
phoebe All right, I have ya. Oh God.
guy Which bedroom do ya want it in Miss Geller?
phoebe Oh, it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay.
guy Gotcha.
rachel Hi Daddy!
dr_green This where they put it? What, there no table available in the kitchen! Hello, baby.
rachel You remember Ross.
dr_green Um-hmm.
ross Nice to see you again Dr. Green.
dr_green So! How's the library?
ross Ugh, museum.
dr_green What happened to the library?
ross There never was a library. I mean there are libraries, its just that I ah, I never worked at one.
dr_green You know what's really good here, the lobster. What do you say shall I just order three.
ross Yeah, if you're really hungry. It was a joke, I made a joke.
rachel Yeah, actually Daddy Ross is allergic to lobster.
dr_green What kind of person is allergic to lobster? I guess the kind of person that works at a library.
ross It's not a library...
dr_green I know!! It's a museum! What, you're the only one around here who can make a joke! At least mine was funny. Ah, waiter, we will have two lobsters and a menu.
ross So, Dr. Green, how's the old boat.
dr_green They found rust. You know what rust does to a boat?
ross It gives it a nice antiquey look.
dr_green Rust, is boat cancer, Ross.
ross Wow. I'm sorry, when I was a kid I lost a bike to that.
dr_green Excuse me for a moment, will you please, I want to say good night to the Levines, before we go.
rachel Okay.
ross Okay!
rachel Aw honey stop! It's not that bad.
ross Yeah. Op! Uh-oh! I think your Dad must've added wrong. He only tipped like four percent.
rachel Yeah. That's Daddy.
ross That's Daddy?! But doesn't it bother you? You're a waitress.
rachel Yes, it bothers me Ross, but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house, I'd be serving him sneezers.
ross So?
rachel So. Ross, I've bugged him about this a million times, he's not gonna change.
ross You really serve people sneezers?
rachel Well um, I don't.
dr_green You kids ready?
ross Thanks again, Dr. Green.
dr_green All right.
dr_green Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, I think I forgot my receipt.
ross Oh, ah, you don't need that.
dr_green Why not?
ross The carbon, it's messy, I mean it gets on your fingers and causes, the, the ah, night blindness.
dr_green What is this? Who put a twenty down here? Huh?
ross Oh, yeah, that would be me, um, I have, I have a problem I-I tip way too much, way, way, too much, it's a sickness really.
rachel Yeah it is, it is. We really, really have to do something about that.
ross I know.
dr_green Excuse me, you think I'm cheap?
rachel Oh Daddy, no he didn't mean anything by that, he really didn't.
ross Nothing I do means anything, really.
dr_green This is nice. I pay two hundred dollars for dinner, you put down twenty, and you come out looking like Mr. Big Shot. You really want to be Mr. Big Shot? Here, I'll tell you what, you pay the whole bill, Mr. Big Shot, all right.
ross Well Mr. Big Shot is better than 'wethead'.
joey Okay, some tricks of the trade. Now, I've never been able to cry as an actor, so if I'm in a scene where I have to cry, I cut a hole in my pocket, take a pair of tweezers, and just start pulling. Or ah, or, let's say I wanna convey that I've just done something evil. That would be the basic 'I have a fishhook in my eyebrow and I like it' Okay, let's say I've just gotten bad news, well all I do there is try and divide 232 by 13. And that's how it's done. Great soap opera acting tonight everybody, class dismissed.
student Hey, Mr. Trib.
joey Hey-hey.
student Guess what, I got an audition!
joey Awww, one of my students got an audition. I'm so proud.
student I was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it?
joey You bet! What's the part?
student Oh it's great, it's a role on All My Children, Nick the boxer.
rachel You had to do it, didn't you? You couldn't just leave it alone.
ross Four percent. Okay. I tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.
rachel Ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along. Oh, would you just see my chiropractor, already.
ross Yeah, I'm gonna go to a doctor who went to school in a mini-mall.
ross Hey Pheebs, what are you doing?
phoebe I'm, I'm freaking out! Monica kinda trusted me with something and she shouldn't have! All right, I haven't lived here in a while, so I have to ask you something. Does Monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom?
rachel Um. yeah.
phoebe I am soo dead.
rachel All right, look, here's the bottom line Ross, this is fixable, if we act fast, okay. So, I'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.
ross Look, honey, I have tried to make nice, it doesn't work.
rachel Okay, look, Ross, I realise that my Father is difficult, but that's why you have got to be the bigger man here.
ross Look sweetie, I could be the bigger man, I could be the biggest man, I could be a big, huge, giant man, and it still wouldn't make any difference, except that I could pick your Father up and say 'Like me! Like me tiny doctor!'
rachel Okay, well can't you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?
ross Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we're never gonna get along.
rachel Okay, well you are just gonna have too, okay. Because I already got a Mother and a Father who cannot stay in the same room together, okay, I don't wanna have to have a separate room for you too!!
ross Okay, okay, okay. I'll get the bagels.
monica What's this?
phoebe Isn't it cool! Varoom! Varoom!
monica This is not the bed I ordered!
phoebe I know, you must've won like a contest or something!
monica Phoebe!
monica Why is this car in my bedroom?
phoebe I'm sorry, okay, I-I wasn't looking, and the store says that they won't take it back because you signed for it...
monica When did I sign for it?
phoebe When I was you! Y'know what, it's all Joey's fault, 'cause he left his nose open!
monica Did you make brownies today?
chandler Knock, knock.
monica Quick, take off your dress, he won't notice the bed.
chandler Hey, I'm going for sushi does anybody want.. Whoa-whoa, somebody missed the off ramp.
phoebe It's Monica's bed. What?
chandler Okay. It's a racecar.
phoebe So. This has always been Monica's bed, what you're just noticing now, how self-involved are you?
chandler Okay, well it this bed isn't new, how come there is plastic on the mattress?
monica Sometimes I have bad dreams.
student Look, I just saw my best friends brains smeared across the canvas, that's not gonna be me, not me.
joey Wow! That was good. That was... Tweezers?
student No.
joey Whoa. That was really good.
student Thanks, any suggestions?
chandler You told him to play the boxer gay!!
joey Well, I-I might've said supergay.
chandler You totally screwed him over.
monica Joey, you're this guy's teacher. I mean how could you do this?
joey Because, Monica, the guy's so good, and I really, really want this part.
phoebe Well, if you really, really want it, then it's okay.

rachel What?!
ross Look, look I'm sorry. It's just that....
dr_green Ross? What's with the neck?
rachel He's got this thing. And I keep telling him to go to my chiropractor...
dr_green You're still going to that chiropractor, that man couldn't get into medical school in Extapa!
ross Thank you! That's what I keep saying.
rachel Excuse me, Dr. Bobby happens to be an excellent doctor.
ross Uh.
dr_green Wait a minute, his name is Dr. Bobby?
rachel Well that's his last name.
ross And his first name.
dr_green He's Bobby Bobby?
rachel It's Robert Bobby.
dr_green Oh.
rachel And um, excuse me, he helps me.
ross Oh-ho please. Ask her how?
dr_green What do you need help for?
rachel With my alignment. I've got one leg shorter than the other.
dr_green Oh God!
ross Argue with that.
rachel What? It's true, my right leg is two inches shorter.
dr_green Come on! You're just titling! Her legs are fine!
ross I know that!
dr_green So, why do you let her go to a chiropractor for?
rachel I'm sorry, let her?
ross What can I do, she doesn't listen to me about renter's insurance either.
dr_green Wait a minute, you don't have renter's insurance?!
rachel No.

ross Okay. Wow! This is going so well. Did you see us? Did you see?
rachel Yeah honey, I'm standing right there! Why didn't you just tell him about the mole I haven't got checked yet.
ross Excellent!
joey There will come a time in each of your careers when you'll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor. I had such an opportunity in the recent, present. And I'm ashamed to say that I took it, I advised a fellow actor to play a role, homosexually. Yeah, we both auditioned for the part, and uh, as it turned out, they ah, they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him. And now, he's got a two year contract opposite Susan Luchhi, the first lady of daytime television, and me, me I'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people, most of whom are too ugly to even be on TV. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you.
jester Uh, may I help you?
monica Yeah, I talked to you on the phone, I'm the lady that got stuck with the racecar bed.
jester Look, it's like I told you, there's nothing I can do. You signed for it, Monica Velula Geller.
joey All right, Jester man, look we wanna see the king.
jester Nobody sees the king!
joey Oh-ho-kay, I'm talking to the king.
jester Hey! You can't go back there!
janice Oh my God.
chandler Varrrrrroom! Hey! Watch it lady! Varrrrrrrrrrom! Hey-hey good lookin'! Varrrrrrrrroom. All right, I'll leave. My bed's so boring.
