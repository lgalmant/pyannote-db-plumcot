joey I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
all Did not, she did not wink at you....
chandler Huh.
ross I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
rachel Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
phoebe See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss.
rachel What song was that, Pheebs?
phoebe Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za.
phoebe Hi Monica!
ross Hey Mon!
rachel Hey Mon!
phoebe Oh my God, has she slept at all?
ross Nope.
rachel No, it's been three nights in a row.
ross Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so.
phoebe Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
chandler Morning.
joey Morning, hey, you made pancakes?
chandler Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that.
janice Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up. Good morning Joey.
joey Good morning.
chandler Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me.
janice Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer.
chandler I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
janice I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss.
chandler Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay.
joey Kiss her! Kiss her!
janice I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey.
joey B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
chandler Nope, not this time.
joey Come on, quite yankin' me.
chandler I'm not yanking you.
joey This is Janice.
chandler Yeah, I know. She makes me happy.
joey Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking.
chandler I'm not breaking up with her!
monica God, look what I found in the drain.
rachel What?!
monica It's some of Richard's hair! What do I do with this?
ross Getting it away from me would be job one.
monica It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh!
phoebe Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.
monica God, what is wrong with me.
ross You need to get some sleep.
monica I need to get some Richard.
rachel Monica, you broke up with him for a reason.
monica I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!
phoebe Maybe, because you told him not to.
monica What are you the memory woman?
joey Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
rachel Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute.
joey Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
rachel Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?
joey There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
ross Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her.
joey Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?
rachel Honey, I was wondering....
ross Hmm?
rachel Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?
ross Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place.
rachel Hmm.
ross I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
rachel You remember not having sex in high school, right?
ross Yeah.
rachel Well honey, what about you?
ross What?
rachel I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?
ross No.
rachel Come on you gotta have one!
ross Nope.
rachel Ross, you know what...
ross What?
rachel ..if you tell me, I might do it.
ross Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?
rachel Yeah.
ross Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia.
rachel Oooh!
ross Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool.
phoebe Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that.
rachel Really!
phoebe Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know.
rachel Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
phoebe Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!
rachel Really! That-that great huh?
phoebe No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
ross Hey!
rachel Hi you guys!
ross Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
rachel Mon. Hi!
monica Hi.
rachel Why aren't you at work?
monica Oh, they-they sent me home.
rachel Why?
monica Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
ross Okay.
rachel You really, really need to get some sleep, honey.
monica I know I do.
ross Hi.
rachel Hi.
ross Guess what?
rachel What?
ross They published my paper.
rachel Oh, really, let me see, let me see.
phoebe Rach, look! Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me. There he is.
chandler Hey!
joey Wheel!
chandler Of!
joey Fortune! This guy is so stupid. It's Count Rushmore!!
chandler You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?
joey I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?
chandler No, Janice.
joey Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers.
chandler You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?
joey No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?
chandler Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!
joey Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know.
chandler Well, there you go.
joey Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?
chandler Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'! Don't worry, those are the right letters.
joey Look, what do you want me to say?
chandler I want you to say that you like her!
joey I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her.
chandler Thanks for trying. Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!
joey Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?
ross How could you have told her?
rachel Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal.
ross Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal.
rachel Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?
ross Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us.
rachel Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff.
ross That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'.
rachel Were both of those Joey?
ross Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her.
rachel Not even with your best friend.
ross Noo!
rachel That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are.
ross Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?
rachel Pretty much.
ross Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
rachel Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol.
ross I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think.
phoebe Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place.
monica Richard's living room, drinking wine.
phoebe All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!
monica I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.
phoebe Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything.
monica All right, I'll try not to.
phoebe Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky....
monica Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
phoebe All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees....
monica I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine.
phoebe All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook....
monica Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee.
janice So, I hear, you hate me!
joey I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that.
janice A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
joey And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
janice All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together.
joey But what does that gonna do...
janice For Chandler!
joey Okay. I'm in.
janice Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
joey Does it have to be a whole day?
janice Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.
joey Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room.
monica So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil War. He loved the Civil War.
phoebe Monica, do you want us to take you home?
monica Uh, huh. Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.
ross Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
chandler Umm, yeah.
ross No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth....
chandler Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?
ross Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?
chandler We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
ross Nooo!
chandler Yeah, okay.
ross Yeah?
chandler Yeah! All right! You go first.
ross Okay, okay, I'll go first.
chandler Okay.
ross So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing....
chandler Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
ross Yes!
chandler I know!
ross Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go.
chandler Okay.
ross Okay.
chandler Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman.
ross Hmph.
chandler And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place....
ross With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!
chandler I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!
ross Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?
chandler You said...
ross I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there!
janice We're baack!
joey Hey!
chandler What are you guys doing together?
janice Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!!
chandler Really.
joey Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy.
janice I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler.
chandler You still can't stand her can you?
joey I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did.
chandler Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a shot.
joey But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium.
chandler Well, I guess that's something.
joey No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway.
chandler Okay.
joey Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross.
chandler Oh God!
joey Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too.
chandler Really?
joey Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex.

monica Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?
mr_geller Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle. Since when did you start smoking cigars?
monica I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?
mr_geller Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
monica What makes you think that I might not be okay?
mr_geller I saw Richard.
monica Oh.
mr_geller So, how are you doing?
monica I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?
mr_geller You don't wanna know.
monica No, I really, really do.
mr_geller Well, he's doing terrible!
monica Really!
mr_geller Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
monica You're not just saying that are you?
mr_geller No, the man is a mess.
monica Was he crying?
mr_geller No.
monica Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?
mr_geller Maybe.
monica I think so.
mr_geller Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However,
rachel Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?
ross No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's
mrs_geller Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here.
ross I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life.
