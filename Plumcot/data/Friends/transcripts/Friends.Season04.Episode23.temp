monica Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!!
chandler Six-hour trip to London. That's a lot of Monica.
monica Passport, check! Camera, check! Traveller's cheques, check!
rachel Who are you saying "check" too?
monica Myself. Y'know for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.
phoebe Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.
ross Hey!
monica Hey!
ross Hey! Are you ready yet?
monica Yep! You got the tickets?
ross Oh! Got 'em right here, check!
joey It's all London, baby! Here we go.
chandler You got your passport?
joey Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You don't want to lose that.
joey Ohh!!
chandler There it is.
monica Okay, if you need the vacuum, it's in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigerator
phoebe Okay, okay, but Rachel's gonna be here too, can't I just ask her this stuff?
monica Yeah, okay, give that a try!
chandler All right! Let's do it!
joey Woo-hoo!!
ross Yeah, cheerie-o!
joey London baby!
chandler Okay, 'cause that's not gonna get annoying.
joey London baby!!
chandler Hey, y'know what? I was wrong.
ross Well, we're all here! I guess we should get going!
phoebe Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I don't-can't get up.
ross Oh, I'll-I'll come hug you.
phoebe Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?
ross Yeah.
phoebe Oh, have a great wedding!
ross Thanks.
phoebe Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!
chandler Hey!
phoebe Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, it's on the counter in your apartment.
chandler Oh.
ross So, we're off.
rachel Have fun!
ross Thanks! Ugh, I can't believe you're not gonna be there!
rachel Oh, I know.
ross So-so come! Why don't you come?
rachel What?!
ross To London! Come to London. Please? It'll mean so much to me.
rachel Yeah, well, I gotta work, I'm sorry.
ross Why-why can't you take a couple of days off?
rachel Because, I can't! Ross, I told you, no. I can't.
ross This is my wedding.
monica All right, y'know what? We really are late! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!!
ross Fine. You'll-you'll watch it on video when we get back.
chandler Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.
phoebe Thank you.
phoebe Thank you.
ross All right, let's go! Bye, Pheebs!
joey Bye, Pheebs!
joey London baby!!
phoebe Oh, do you need a hug? You don't have to bring me anything!
joey Come on! Do something!
chandler I am, I'm ignoring you.
joey Okay, here! I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey.
chandler Oh, what the hell is that?
joey It's London, baby! All right, the hotel's here. Wait. No, we wanna go... No. I know. I'm gonna have to go into the map.
chandler Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!
joey I got it! Here we go.
chandler Okay. Listen-listen, we're not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?
joey Shhh! Man, you made me lose it!
emily ...and that was all before 10 o'clock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there aren't any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. We're not gonna be
ross Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, honey, okay?
emily Well, up yours too!
ross What?! No! No! That's-that's time-out!
emily Sorry.
ross Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everything's gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.
monica Chicken Kiev?
ross Um-hmm! Doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?
monica Yeah, y'know, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella. So, I can't wait to see this place you're getting married!
ross Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emily's parents got married here.
emily I still can't believe they're tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building you'll ever see. I mean it's over... Oh my God!
monica It's nice.
emily Oh. Oh.
emily Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?
ross It's all right! Everything's gonna be all right.
emily How's it gonna be all right?!
ross Uh-huh, I see that.
monica Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.
ross What? What?
monica They torn it down a few days early.
joey All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey I've ever seen. Hey! Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?
chandler I think it's great. It's great. Y'know, they're thinking of changing the name of this place.
joey Really? To what?
chandler To Put the Camera Away!!!
joey Man, you are Westminster Crabby.
phoebe Oh. Oh.
rachel Oh, honey! Don't get up! What do you need?
phoebe Oh, no. Oh, nothing.
rachel Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.
phoebe Okay, I have a wedgie.
rachel Okay, that is all you.
phoebe So-so, what do you want for lunch?
rachel Oh, I don't know. I guess we have to eat.
phoebe Yeah, I do. What's the matter?
rachel I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.
phoebe Eh, don't be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting married
rachel Still in love with?!
phoebe Yeah!
rachel I'm not in love with Ross!
phoebe Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.
rachel Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!
phoebe We thought you knew!
rachel We?!
phoebe Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!
rachel You all know? Does Ross know?
phoebe Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.
rachel Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!
phoebe Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."
joey Hey!
the_vendor So, what are you guys in the market for? We've got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...
joey Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?
chandler Well, I don't have to buy that, "I'm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.
joey Well, I like it. Here you go.
chandler All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?
joey Oh, I embarrass you?
chandler How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?
the_vendor He's just jealous. You'll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!
chandler Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?
the_vendor They're all tourists.
chandler All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.
joey Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.
the_vendor Good choice.
joey Thanks.
chandler Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!
emily Hello?
ross Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.
emily We don't have to.
ross Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?
emily No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.
ross She said what?
emily She said, "If I'm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."
ross Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.
emily I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, I'm sure they'll come back when we can do it right.
ross I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?
emily Don't you point your pants at me! We have no choice! Anywhere that's half-decent would've be booked months ago, Ross don't you understand? This is our wedding I'm talking about.
ross The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.
emily So what are you saying? It's now or never?
ross No. I'm saying it's now.
emily Or?
ross There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!
emily It's not the pants. It's you that is backwards. And if, and if you don't understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldn't get married at all!
ross No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hi.
phoebe So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?
rachel Manhattan does not have enough stores.
phoebe Well, I think I can help you get over him.
rachel You can?
phoebe Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.
rachel Um-hmm.
phoebe And a small piece of chocolate.
rachel Okay.
phoebe And a glass of tepid water.
rachel Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
phoebe Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.
rachel I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.
phoebe Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?
rachel I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.
phoebe Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.
rachel Okay.
phoebe Okay?
rachel All right.
phoebe So uh, now look at the picture
rachel Okay.
phoebe All right, and umm
rachel Ow!
phoebe Okay, how do you feel now?
rachel Well, I like you less!
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
joey Oh. Sorry!
chandler No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.
joey Me too.
chandler Yeah?
joey Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out!
monica Hey!
joey Sh-shh-shh!
joey Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.
fergie Okay, so umm, what's your friend's name?
joey Oh, Chandler.
fergie Hi Chandler!
chandler That's... That's was
monica Oh my God!
joey That's Fergie baby!!
fergie Joey says you don't really like his hat, but I think it's kinda dashing.
chandler How did you? How? How?
joey Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, I'm in my map and-and... Hey!
monica Hey!
ross Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.
monica Yes, I did! And you are welcome!
ross Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!
monica Umm
chandler I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
joey Wait up!
ross Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?
monica She said that?!
ross Yeah.
monica Why?!
ross I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.
monica Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!
ross Excuse me?
monica Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?
ross I don't know. A month?
monica Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.
ross I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.
monica Sometimes we were.
ross Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?
monica Okay.
ross Come on.
chandler That was pretty intense huh?
joey Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!
chandler I hope he did!
phoebe Hello.
joey Hey, Pheebs! It's Joey!
phoebe Hey, Joey! Hey! Ooh! Ooh! I just say someone on the-that looks just like you on the subway. And I was gonna go over and say 'hi!' but then I figured, he doesn't care if he looks like you.
joey That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?
phoebe Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?
joey Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.
phoebe So you're not homesick yet?
joey No, I don't think so.
phoebe All right, the seven of us miss you.
joey Who's seven?
phoebe Y'know, me, Rachel, the birds, the babies
joey Ahh, the babies miss me?
phoebe Ooh, the pizza guy's here!
joey What? You ordered pizza without me?!
phoebe Yeah. But y'know we were thinking about you, y'know we ordered the Joey Special.
joey Two pizzas?!
phoebe Yep! Okay, gotta go, talk to you later.
joey Wait, well, where did you get it from?!
emily Monica, why have you brought me here of all places?!
monica You'll see.
emily I tell you, this wedding is not going to happen.
emily Oh God.
ross Okay? But-but imagine a lot more lights, okay? And-and y'know fewer bricks, and-and-and flowers, and candles
monica And the musicians, look, they can go over here , okay? And the chairs can face this way , and... You go.
ross But-but, if you don't love this, we'll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, it's fine, whatever you want.
emily It's perfect.
ross And, I don't know, if it starts to rain
emily Well then we'll get wet.
monica Ohh. And I don't even have a date.
rachel Pheebs?
phoebe Yeah?
rachel Do you remember where the duck food is?
phoebe Yeah, it's in the guys' apartment under the sink. Why?
rachel Because I'm going to London.
phoebe What?! What do you mean you're going to London?
rachel Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you don't have those babies until I get back.
phoebe I-Rachel, you can't go! Ross loves Emily!
rachel Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.
phoebe That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."
rachel Ohh-Do you think he will?!
phoebe No! Because he's in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Y'know, it's too late! You missed you're chance! I'm sorry, I know this must be really hard, it's over.
rachel Y'know what? No. It's not over until someone says, "I do."
phoebe I do! I do! I do! I do! Ugh, like I can really chase you. I'm carrying a litter.
housekeeper The Waltham Residence.
phoebe Oh...yes..is this..umm..Emily's Parents' house.
housekeeper This is the housekeeper speaking. And by the way, young lady, that is not how one addresses oneself on the telephone. First one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
phoebe This is Phoebe Buffay. I was wondering, please, if-if it's not too much trouble, please, umm, might I speak to Miss Emily Waltham, please?
housekeeper Miss Waltham, is at the rehearsal dinner and it's not polite to make fun of people. Goodbye.
phoebe No no no, I'll be nice, I swear!!! Could you just give me the number for where they are?
housekeeper I'm afraid, I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.
phoebe Ok, somebody is on their way to ruin wedding okay. And I have to warn somebody, alright. So if you don't give me that number then I'm going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to New Glocken..shire.
housekeeper Hangs up.
phoebe Hello, Hello. Ohh, OHH, she knew I could kick her ass.
monica Hey.

waiter Goat cheese, water chestnuts, and panchetta.
joey That's not food...No, I don't, no... Everything's different here...I want to go home. I...I miss my family. I miss the coffee house. I can't even remember what Phoebe looks like.
chandler Joey, it's been three days, okay.. Your just a little homesick, Okay. Would you just try to relax. Just, just try to enjoy yourself.
joey Your different here too. Your mean in England.
mr_geller What the hell!!!
ross what's up, Dad?
mr_geller This bill for my half of the wedding. it's insane.
mrs_geller How could it be so much? The receptions at their house.
mr_geller Flowers, liquor, recarpet first floor. New guest bath, landscaping. I'm paying to remodel this guys house. I'm going to give that son on a bitch, a piece of my mind.
ross Dad, dad, please. Look I don't want anything to upset Emily tonight. Alright, she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is. Now here, here, let me go talk to him, okay?
mr_geller And you tell him no one takes advantage of the Gellers.
mrs_geller Ooh, Jack.... Sometimes I forget how powerful you can be.
monica And I'm going to go get drunk.
rachel Ooh, ooh, ooh,ooh,ooh. Hi.

mr_waltham Ahh, then you have to give us the lawn ornaments.
ross I go back there with lawn ornaments, he's going to laugh in my face.
mrs_waltham This is ridiculous. I mean we had an agreement. Will you say something, Steven?! Please!!!
mr_waltham Don't take that tone with me. All-all right you can.
rachel Hi, Pheebs.
phoebe Oh thank god. Oh, you changed your mind. Oh, look I know you probably want to be alone, and you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just want you to know, I think you are doing the right thing and...
rachel Bye, Pheebs.
phoebe Wait!! Where are you going?! What are you doing?! No!! Wait!! God!! Why am I always pregnant when she does that?!
chandler I'd like to toast, Ross and Emily. Of course, my big toast will be tomorrow at the wedding, so this is kind of my little toast or Melba toast, if you will. Okay. I known Ross for a long time. In fact, I knew him when he was going out with his first girlfriend. And I thought things were going to work out for him..Until the day he over inflated her. Ohh, Dear God..
mrs_waltham Hello, Waltham Interiors.
phoebe Oh, hi, Mrs. Waltham. I need to speak with ether one of the best men, or Ross's sister Monica.

phoebe Ohh! Okay, I'm going to have to kick her ass too.
chandler And I'm sure we're all very excited that Ross and Emily are getting married at Montgomery Hall. I mean to think, my friend getting married in Monty Hall. Ohh, come on!! Monty Hall!! Lets make a Deal!! Come on, you people!! All right, forget it!! Congratulations, Ross and Emily.
joey Hey, best man number two, Joey Tribbiani. Now I'm not good with the jokes like Chandler here. Boy...but ahh, I just want to say congratulation to the happy couple. I first met Ross in this coffee house back home...Home...New York City...Where everybody knows my name. Well anyway, I love you guys. But not as much as I love America. Could we please..go home now?
felicity Are you going home? I was hoping to get to know you better.
joey I'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.

monica Well I didn't want everyone to think I was stupid.
chandler So how are you doing?
monica My mother's driving me crazy, but Ross is getting married. I'm happy. I'm not going to let anything spoil that.
drunk_man I just want to say that Ross is a wonderful young man.
monica Well, thanks, we like him.
drunk_man My god!! You must have been a teenage when you had him.
mr_geller There's no way in hell, I'm paying for it.
ross Look, were down to just one point. Could we please, maybe just settle it after the wedding.
mr_geller All-right fine, but I just want to say, I'm not paying for your wine cellar. You thieving, would be speaking German if it weren't for us, cheap little man.
chandler The guy was hammered, okay? There's no way, you look like Ross's mother.
monica Then why would he say it?
chandler Because he's crazy. Okay? He came up to me earlier and thanked me for my very moving performance in Titanic.
monica Oh, my mother's right. I'm never going to get married.
