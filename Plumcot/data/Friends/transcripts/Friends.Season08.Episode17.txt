rachel_green Joey? Are you in there?
joey_tribbiani Oh God! That's Rachel!
monica_geller Joey, you have to talk to her!
joey_tribbiani No-no, I can't! I can't! Not after the other night, it's just it's...too weird, okay? Don't tell her I'm here! Don't eat that!
rachel_green Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hey Rachel!
rachel_green Is Joey here?
chandler_bing I don't see him. Do you see him?
monica_geller I don't see him. Hey! Maybe he's in the sugar bowl! Joey? Nope!
rachel_green Well, at least you make each other laugh.
monica_geller What's up?
rachel_green Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?
monica_geller We were playing a game.
rachel_green Ew, was Chandler naked? Sort of like a, like a ring toss kind of situation?
monica_geller Sure.
chandler_bing What?! No! No!
rachel_green All right. Well listen, if you see Joey will you just tell him uh...tell him I miss him.
monica_geller Okay, did you hear that?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, a naked bagel game? Dude, I don't know. That's a pretty small hole.
monica_geller Honey, you gotta talk to her.
joey_tribbiani I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.
chandler_bing I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, "I love you," was, "Oh crap!"
monica_geller Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.
joey_tribbiani All right so, so what do I do?
monica_geller This is Rachel. I mean, what are you gonna do, never going to talk to her again? I mean I know it's weird, it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Okay. Whoa! I almost forgot this was on your
chandler_bing We didn't play it!!
phoebe_buffay Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.
chandler_bing I didn't know you read tea leaves.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.
monica_geller Okay, I'm done. Read mine.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Ooh, I see a ladder. Which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.
monica_geller I-I'm the head chef. I-I can't get promoted.
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm, who's next?
rachel_green Okay, I'm done. Do mine.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Umm, oh! Okay, I see a circle.
rachel_green Ah.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Which can either mean you're having a baby or you're gonna make a scientific discovery!
rachel_green Well, I have been spending a lot of time in the lab.
chandler_bing What does yours say Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Umm... Wow, all right. Wow! Yay! Ooh, I'm gonna meet a guy! And really soon! And he's gonna be the man of my dreams. Probably not the guy I had a dream about last night.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Has anyone seen my shirt? It's a button down, like a, like a faded salmon?
monica_geller You mean your pink shirt?
dr_ross_geller Faded salmon color.
monica_geller No, I-I haven't seen your pink shirt.
dr_ross_geller Great! Great. Then I must've left it at Mona's. I knew it!
chandler_bing Well, I'm sure you get another one at Ann Taylor's.
dr_ross_geller That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!
rachel_green Well just ask Mona to give it back!
dr_ross_geller I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.
phoebe_buffay Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.
chandler_bing Phoebe, did you see that?! He totally checked you out! He is so cute! Mine has a picture of The Village People, what does that mean?
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
rachel_green Hi.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
monica_geller Tea gives Phoebe the trots.
rachel_green So I thought Joey and I would be okay once we hung out, but it's not even like we know how to be with each other anymore.
chandler_bing I know it's tough now, but things will get better.
rachel_green How do you know that? What if it just gets worse and worse and worse, to the point where we can't even be in the same room with each other?!
chandler_bing I'm not great at the advice, can I interest you in a sarcastic comment? Some cheese?
monica_geller Honey, what is the Bruce Springsteen CD in the Kat Stevens case?
chandler_bing Let's just say if I can't find the right CD case I just put it in the nearest one.
monica_geller Okay, where is the Kat Stevens CD?
chandler_bing In the James Taylor case.
monica_geller Where is the James Taylor CD?
chandler_bing Honey, I'm gonna save you some time, 200 CDs, not one of them in the right case.
monica_geller Okay. No need to panic. Deep breathes everyone. Okay umm uh, we're just gonna have to spend some time and put the CDs in the right cases.
chandler_bing Well, if we're gonna do that we should come up with some kind of order. Y'know alphabetically or by genre?
monica_geller Hmm, I don't know. We really have to talk this through.
rachel_green Oh my God!! You guys have such problems!! I feel so terrible for you!
monica_geller Okay, I-I'm sorry. You and Joey, your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing, what you need to do is to change the subject. Next time you see him try to get him talking about something else.
rachel_green Oh yeah. That makes sense.
monica_geller Yeah, like I don't know, maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on.
rachel_green Ooh, I can do that.
monica_geller Good. Uh honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack? Really?
chandler_bing They were just giving those away at the store in exchange for money.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi.
monica_geller Uh I really don't know what to tell you Rach, I really don't. I mean, maybe Joey can help you out with your, with your big work problem.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Yeah Joey she's...Rachel's got this really big work problem, and it is a head scratcher. Wow! Y'know what, if we're gonna make dinner we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.
joey_tribbiani So you uh, have a...big work problem?
rachel_green Yeah it's umm... Yeah it's uh... It-it's y'know-It's nothing.
joey_tribbiani Huh. Okay. So uh, I think I'm gonna take off.
rachel_green Yeah-No wait! Joey no wait it is. It's something. It's-it's umm...it's my boss.
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
rachel_green Yeah, and umm my baby.
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
rachel_green My boss wants to buy my baby!
joey_tribbiani What?! Oh my-oh my God!
rachel_green I know I told you, it's a really big problem.
joey_tribbiani What he wants to buy your baby?!
rachel_green Can you believe that?!
joey_tribbiani That's crazy!
rachel_green That's what I told him!
joey_tribbiani Okay, how did this even happen?
rachel_green Well I'll tell ya! See uh my-my boss and his wife-They-they can't have children. So umm, and that-we were at the Christmas party, and he got drunk, and he said to me, "Rachel, I want to buy your baby."
joey_tribbiani Man! When you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby I figured it was something about maternity leave.
rachel_green Ohh! Yeah! Yeah that-that would've been a much simpler problem.
phoebe_buffay Oh hello.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode17 Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere. I'm Jim, Jim Nelson.
phoebe_buffay Oh Jim, Jim Nelson I'm Phoebe, Phoebe Buffay. We certainly have been seeing a lot of each other lately.
jim_nelson We have. Maybe we'll be seeing each other at dinner tomorrow night, say around 8 o'clock?
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe we will. Oh!
dr_ross_geller Mona? Okay, if I were a salmon shirt, where would I be?
mona I am so sorry I spilled wine all over your shirt.
monas_date Oh, it's okay.
mona No, it's still wet. Y'know what? Let me get it out before it sets. Ooh, I have something you can wear. Here.
monas_date Oh umm, I-I don't know if I want to wear a woman's shirt.
mona No-no that's a man's shirt.
monas_date It's awfully pink.
chandler_bing Oh my God, honey we are so meant to be together. We both have copies of the Annie soundtrack.
monica_geller Honey, both yours.
rachel_green Hey! Great advice on that Joey thing!
monica_geller Yeah? The work problem?
rachel_green Oh it was perfect! I mean it really felt like he was my friend again.
chandler_bing What problem did you tell him you had?
rachel_green Oh that's not important. The point is, I really-I think everything's gonna be okay.
mr_zelner May I help you?
joey_tribbiani Do you think you can just buy my friends baby?!
phoebe_buffay Isn't it funny how we kept running into each other? It's as if someone really wants us to be together.
jim_nelson Someone does. Me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, witty banter. Well done.
jim_nelson So, tell me a little bit about yourself.
phoebe_buffay Oh okay, well I'm a masseuse, and I used to work at this place
jim_nelson Do you like to party?
phoebe_buffay I-I-I like, I like parties.
jim_nelson You're wild, aren't ya?
phoebe_buffay Yeah I guess, a little.
jim_nelson It ain't no thing, I'm wild too.
phoebe_buffay So! Umm, anyway I-I lived in New York, someone wildly I guess, for umm-Well since I was fourteen.
jim_nelson I'm sorry. I'm staring. It's just that you have the most beautiful eyes.
phoebe_buffay Oh stop it.
jim_nelson And your breasts! Hmm!!!
phoebe_buffay Okay. Umm look, you're coming on a little strong. But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt, because it seems the universe really wants to be together. So, why don't we just start over okay? And you can just tell me about yourself.
jim_nelson All right.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
jim_nelson I write erotic novels, for children.
phoebe_buffay What?!
jim_nelson They're wildly unpopular.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
jim_nelson Oh also, you might be interested to know that I have a Ph.D.
phoebe_buffay Wow! You do?
jim_nelson Yeah, a Pretty Huge
phoebe_buffay All right.
chandler_bing The sun'll come out...tomorrow! Bet...your bottom dollar that tomorrow.....there'll be sun.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hey! Oh Joey, honey listen, thank you for talking to my yesterday about that thing with my boss. That really meant a lot.
joey_tribbiani Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know, that guy's not going to be bothering you about that baby thing anymore.
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani Let's just say I took care of it.
rachel_green Whoa-whoa-whoa, let's say more!
joey_tribbiani Don't worry! Don't worry. I just told him, very nicely, "You don't go buying people's babies, so back off!!"
rachel_green What?!
chandler_bing@monica_geller What?!
rachel_green No! No, no-no-no Joey he doesn't want to buy my baby! I made that up!
joey_tribbiani What?! Why?!
rachel_green So that we would have something to talk about! So it wouldn't be awkward!
joey_tribbiani And you couldn't think of anything else?!
monica_geller You said your boss wants to buy your baby?!
rachel_green I can't believe that you yelled at my boss! I'm-I'm gonna lose my job! What am I going to do?!
chandler_bing You can always sell your baby.
rachel_green Oh Joey, I can't believe you brought my boss into this! I'm gonna get fired!
joey_tribbiani You lied to me!
rachel_green Well, she told me too!
monica_geller Chandler has two copies of Annie!
mona Oh my God! Ross!!!
dr_ross_geller Hello!!
mona Ross, what are you doing?!
dr_ross_geller Not touching myself if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.
rachel_green Morning. You wanted to see me?
mr_zelner Please, come in. Have a seat.
rachel_green Okay look Mr. Zelner
mr_zelner Oh I think it's best that I speak first.
rachel_green Yeah.
mr_zelner I've asked Lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.
rachel_green Oh God.
mr_zelner If I in any way implied that I wanted to buy your baby...I am sorry. Okay? Last week when I asked you when your due date was uh, I certainly did not mean that I felt that I was due your baby. Yeah, I want to be very clear that I understand that its your baby, and it is not mine to purchase.
rachel_green Well, as long as we are clear about that.
phoebe_buffay Oh there it is.
monica_geller That's not your regular dry cleaners.
phoebe_buffay I know, but that creep that I went on that date with goes to there so I have to find a new one. I also have to find a new video store, a new bank, a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store
monica_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay A new grocery store. The universe said I was going to meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me? When I get up there I'm going to kick some ass.
monica_geller Don't worry Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone. If I can meet a great guy, so can you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, we both can. And we both will.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
monica_geller Are you kidding? This is where they get out stains! Okay? This is like Disneyland for me. I'm-I'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode17 Oh, excuse me! I think you dropped s... Wow!
phoebe_buffay What?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode17 I'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah well, I'm sorry about that too, but what are you going to do?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode17 I hope you don't think I'm crazy but I feel like I was meant to pick this up, do you believe in that kind of thing?
phoebe_buffay A little. Now you're talking.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode17 Would you like to go out and have a cup of coffee?
phoebe_buffay I-I-I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.
monica_geller Ooh, an ink stain! Hey, can I watch how you get this out?
phoebe_buffay She must've left.
rachel_green Hi.
joey_tribbiani So? What-what-what happened?
rachel_green It's all gonna be okay. They're just so happy that I'm not suing them that they gave me one extra month paid maternity leave. So long as I understand that the money should not construed as a down payment on this or any other child I should bear.
chandler_bing Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.
rachel_green Chandler, can you give us a minute?
chandler_bing Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?
rachel_green Yeah.
chandler_bing I'll be in there.
rachel_green Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you. I was just trying to make things
joey_tribbiani I know. I know.
rachel_green It kinda worked. I mean y'know, I don't know about you buy I haven't thought about our thing since all this.
joey_tribbiani Hey you're right. Yeah, it's kinda been like us again a little bit.
rachel_green Yeah I know! I miss that.
joey_tribbiani Me too. I mean I...haven't thought at all about how I put myself out there and said all that stuff and how you didn't feel the same way about me and-and how it was really awkward.
rachel_green My gynecologist tried to kill me.
dr_ross_geller Item J437-A, color: winterberry. Hi umm, listen come here, come in. I'm so-so sorry about yesterday. I-I'm really sorry. It's just that I
mona Listen Ross, you don't have to apologize. I understand why you were there.
dr_ross_geller You do?
mona Yeah, you still have feelings for me. And-and to be honest, I-I still have feelings for you. And I wish that we can work it out Ross, but we can't. It's too complicated with you and Rachel and the baby, I-I just... It just wasn't meant to be.
dr_ross_geller Oh God you're right.
mona Ross, we...we have to be strong. Okay, I-I'm gonna go. Can I? To remember you?
dr_ross_geller No.
