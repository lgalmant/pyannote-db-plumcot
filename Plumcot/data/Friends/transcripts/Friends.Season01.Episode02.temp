monica What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
joey Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
phoebe Oh, yeah!
rachel Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
monica Absolutely.
chandler Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
ross Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
chandler The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
rachel Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
joey ...Are we still talking about sex?
ross No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
marsha Well, she has issues.
ross Does she.
marsha He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!
ross Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
marsha Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?
ross No. No.
marsha Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!
ross Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
ross Hi.
carol So.
ross You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
carol Sorry. You look good too.
ross Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
carol A lesbian?
ross Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
carol Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-
ross Why- why are you here, Carol?
carol I'm pregnant.
ross Pregnant?!
chandler Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
phoebe ...Then I've already seen this one!
monica Are you through with that?
joey Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
monica Whose little ball of paper is this?!
chandler Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and....now I wish I was dead.
phoebe She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- -but, it's fine!
monica Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
chandler Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
phoebe Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
joey Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
monica That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
chandler Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
monica What?
chandler Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
all Eeaagh!
rachel Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
phoebe Yeah, it's beautiful.
rachel Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....
phoebe No, look, don't touch that!
rachel Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
monica Easy Rach, we'll find it. Won't we!
chandler_and_joey Oh! Yeah!
joey Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
phoebe Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
chandler You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
rachel I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
chandler ..Dinah?
rachel Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
monica You didn't.
rachel Oh, I am sorry...
monica I gave you one job!
rachel Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
chandler Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
monica I just... can't do it.
chandler Boys? We're going in.
ross ....Hi.
monica Wow. That is not a happy hi.
ross Carol's pregnant.
phoebe Ooh! I found it!
monica W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
ross Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.
chandler Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
rachel Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
ross Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
phoebe She is so great! I miss her.
monica What does she mean by 'involved'?
chandler I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
ross Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
rachel So what are you gonna do?
ross I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
joey ....Well, this is still ruined, right?
mrs_geller Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste?
monica Curry.
mrs_geller Mmmm!
ross I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
mr_geller Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?
mrs_geller They all had a thing for him.
ross Aw, Mom...
monica I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
mrs_geller Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-
monica No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
mrs_geller Well, they don't have to know that...
monica Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
ross Yeah.
mrs_geller Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.
monica I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
mrs_geller What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.
mr_geller I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
mrs_geller Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...
monica What's that supposed to mean?
mrs_geller Nothing! It's an expression.
monica No it's not.
mr_geller Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...
mr_geller Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.
mr_geller ..And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.
monica So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
ross Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
mrs_geller And you knew about this?!
joey Your folks are really that bad, huh?
ross Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
monica Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- -I'd want yours.
ross Must pee.
phoebe Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
rachel You're twins?
phoebe Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
chandler What does she do?
phoebe She's a waitress.
rachel All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
monica Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
chandler Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
rachel The lights, please..
ross ..How long was I in there?
rachel I'm just cleaning up.
ross D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
rachel Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!
ross Anyway.. um.. So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
rachel Oh.. a little..
ross Mm-hmm..
rachel A lot.
ross Mm.
rachel So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
ross Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
rachel Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
ross Got me.
rachel Remember when we were in high school together?
ross Yeah.
rachel I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?Ross?
ross Yes, yes!
rachel Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..
ross Me either...
ross Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
susan Hi.
carol Ross, you remember Susan.
ross How could I forget?
susan Ross.
ross Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
carol Dr. Oberman.
ross .Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
susan She.
ross -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
carol Yes, and she's very supportive.
ross Okay, that's great. No, I'm- Oh.
carol Thanks.
ross Quack, quack..
carol Ross? That opens my cervix.
rachel Barry?
barry C'mon in.
rachel Are you sure?
barry Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.
robbie Huh?!
barry So, how ya doin?

barry Yeah, well..
bernice Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging.
barry Be right there. Be back in a sec.
rachel I dumped him.
robbie Okay.
ross So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
carol Give me a 'for instance'.
ross Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
carol Marlon-
ross Marlon?!
carol -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.
ross ..As in Mouse?
carol As in my grandmother.
ross Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
carol Julia..
susan We agreed on Minnie.
ross 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
barry Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
rachel Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
barry Oh, that's great.
rachel Why are- why are you so tanned?
barry Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba.
rachel Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
barry No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt.
robbie Me?!
barry No! I went with Mindy.
rachel Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
barry Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.
rachel Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs!
barry Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
rachel And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
barry Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.
rachel Okay..
barry See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.
rachel Wow.
barry You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.
rachel What?
robbie Me.
rachel Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
barry Well, thank you for giving it back.
robbie Hello?!
susan Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?
ross Helen Geller? I don't think so.
carol Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
ross Thank you!
carol No, I mean it's not Geller.
ross What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
carol No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.
ross Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
susan It's my baby too.
ross Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
susan Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!
carol All right, you two, stop it!
ross No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
carol Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
ross Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
susan Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!
ross My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
dr_oberman Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
all Yeah. Yeah. A little.
dr_oberman Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back..
ross You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
ross Oh my God.
susan Look at that.
carol I know.
ross Well? Isn't that amazing?
joey What are we supposed to be seeing here?
chandler I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
phoebe You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
ross Then don't do that, alright?
phoebe Okay!
ross Monica. Whaddya think?
monica Mm-hmm.
ross Wh- are you welling up?
monica No.
ross You are, you're welling up.
monica Am not!
ross You're gonna be an aunt.
monica Oh shut up!
rachel Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
