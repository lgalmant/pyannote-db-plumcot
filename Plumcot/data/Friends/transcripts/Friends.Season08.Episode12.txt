chandler_bing Oh my goodness! Where did you hide it?
phoebe_buffay I got it for your wedding and I ordered it weeks ago, and it finally got here!
chandler_bing Pheebs you didn't have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang
monica_geller I love it! It's huge!! Let's open it! Open it!!
phoebe_buffay It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!!
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay I didn't know where to put it so I just left it here for now.
monica_geller Oh well, maybe we can put it in the guest bedroom.
chandler_bing Oh, okay.
monica_geller All right.
chandler_bing I kinda like it here.
phoebe_buffay Do you really like it?
monica_geller Are you kidding?! I practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade! This is like-Oh my, this is like my second favorite game!
phoebe_buffay Oh really? What was your first?
monica_geller Well I-I really don't remember the name of it.
chandler_bing Well what did it do?
monica_geller Well, you just-you put a quarter in and y'know pull-pull some handles and win like a candy bar or something.
chandler_bing A vending machine?
monica_geller Don't feel bad for me! I won like every time!
dr_ross_geller Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you guys are here. I've been dying to tell someone what happened in the Paleontology department today.
joey_tribbiani Do you think he saw us or can we still sneak out?
dr_ross_geller Professor Neuman, the head of the department, so....
rachel_green They made you head of the department!
dr_ross_geller No, I get to teach one of his advanced classes! Why didn't I get head of the department?
joey_tribbiani Oh! Hey Rach, listen umm
rachel_green Yeah.
joey_tribbiani I got a big date coming up, do you know a good restaurant?
rachel_green Uh, Paul's Caf√°. They got great food and it's really romantic.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, great! Thanks!
rachel_green Yeah! Oh, and then afterwards you can take her to the Four Seasons for drinks. Or you go downtown and listen to some jazz. Or dancing-Oh! Take her dancing!
joey_tribbiani You sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, I'll tell ya
rachel_green Ooh, I miss dating. Gettin' all dressed up and going to a fancy restaurant. I'm not gonna be able to do that for so long, and it's so much fun! I mean not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a sixteen pound baby is not fun.
joey_tribbiani Hey, y'know what?
rachel_green Huh?
joey_tribbiani Why don't I take you out?
rachel_green What?! Joey, you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.
joey_tribbiani Yes I do! And we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time, and take your mind off of childbirth and c-sections and-and giant baby heads stretching out
rachel_green Okay! I'll go with ya! I'll go! I'll go with ya.
joey_tribbiani I'll be fun.
rachel_green All right?
phoebe_buffay No. No! Yes! Ahh. Oh, would you look at that Monica? I just knocked off all of your top scores, how sad.
monica_geller Okay, I'm next. Don't! Don't start another game! I said I'm next! Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you over all the winning.
monica_geller Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game!
chandler_bing Who cares? It's a stupid game.
monica_geller You only think it's stupid because you suck at it.
chandler_bing I don't suck. It's sucks. You suck.
phoebe_buffay Wait okay, if this game is gonna cause problems between the two of you, then maybe I should just keep it.
monica_geller No! No-no! I love it! It is a great present! In fact, why don't you go home and wait for the thank you card?
chandler_bing Why do you want to play this game so bad?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! It's not like it spits out a Clark bar after every game.
monica_geller Okay. Phoebe that's it. Come on, get out-out of the chair. Get out! Oh come...Phoebe!
rachel_green Joey? Could you get that? What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?
joey_tribbiani No, I'm picking you up for our date. These are for you.
rachel_green Ohh, Lilies. Joey, they're my favorite. Thank you.
joey_tribbiani And, a brownie! Well, half a brownie. Actually, it's just bag. It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so
rachel_green Oh man! This is so great! I actually feel like I'm going on a real date! Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.
joey_tribbiani Hey come on now, this is a real date. Uh, so...nice place you got here. Foosball, huh? Pizza box. Oh, a subscription to Playboy, my kind of woman.
rachel_green Yeah, actually that's my roommate's.
joey_tribbiani I would like to meet him. He sounds like a stand up guy.
rachel_green Ah yes, but he's very protective of me so you'd better watch yourself.
joey_tribbiani Ah... Hey, so this roommate of yours...is he good looking?
rachel_green Hm-mmm.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, it must be tough to keep your hands of him, huh?
rachel_green Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no, he's not! No! Why are you trying to ruin the game? Come on!
dr_ross_geller ...which brings us back, of course, to Greely's theory of dominance. Okay, that-that's all for today. Oh, uh does anyone know where the Freeman building is?
the_student Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.
dr_ross_geller What?! That-that's all the way cross town, I'm supposed to teach a graduate seminar there in ten minutes.
the_student Ooh, dude. That's not gonna happen.
dr_ross_geller Move it! Move it! Move it!! Hey!!! I'm the teacher!!
dr_ross_geller Hello. I'm sorry I'm a little late. Ah--Whoa! A lot late. Let me start by uh, by introducing myself, I am Professor Geller. So to sum up, I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.
rachel_green Now the filet mignon, what comes with that?
the_waitress There's a side of steamed vegetables.
rachel_green Emmm. Now, instead of the vegetables, is there anyway I can substitute the three-pound lobster?
joey_tribbiani Y'know what? Bring her both, and I'll have the same.
rachel_green Wow! This is shaping up to be a pretty good date-Oh, I almost forgot. I didn't pay you the rent check.
joey_tribbiani Oh whoa-whoa-whoa, no roommate stuff. Okay? We're on a date.
rachel_green Okay. Wow! So I get to see what Joey Tribbiani is like on a date. So do you have any moves?
joey_tribbiani No! No. Umm, just myself and if they don't like me for- I'm sorry I couldn't even get through that.
rachel_green I knew it! I knew it. Come on tell me your moves.
joey_tribbiani Oh alright. Umm, well, okay, I usually start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.
rachel_green Oh my God. And that works?!
joey_tribbiani Well it does when you combine it with, "This is so embarrassing, I just want to have a normal life!"
rachel_green Oh, you poor little famous man.
joey_tribbiani Oh okay, how about this one. I was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you, but you're so beautiful...I don't think I can.
rachel_green Oh my God! Wow! That was fantastic, I almost leaned in. I really almost did!
joey_tribbiani Alright, so...so tell me one of your moves.
rachel_green Alright. So where'd you grow up?
joey_tribbiani That's your move? Boy Rach, you're lucky you're hot.
rachel_green Come on, just answer the question!
joey_tribbiani Queens.
rachel_green And so were-were you close to your parents?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, with my mom. Yeah, not so much with my dad.
rachel_green Why not?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. I guess there's just always been this distance y'know-I mean we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.
rachel_green Oh. It's gotta be rough.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!
rachel_green Huh?
joey_tribbiani "Where'd you grow up," it's so simple!
rachel_green Thank you! And now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to the rest room.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green And now you're watching me walk away.
joey_tribbiani Yes I am! Again so simple!
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing You are not going to believe what I did today!
monica_geller Well it clearly wasn't showering or shaving.
chandler_bing I got good. I played this game all day and now I rule at it! They should change the name of it to Ms. Chandler. Although I-I hope they don't.
monica_geller Wait a minute, you stayed home all day and played Ms. Pac-Man while I went off to work like some kind of chump?!
chandler_bing Uh-huh, and I got all the top ten scores, I erased Phoebe off the board! High five!
monica_geller What is the matter with your hand?
chandler_bing Well I've been playing it for like eight hours, it'll loosen up. Come on, check out the scores. Oh, and also look at the initials, they're dirty words.
monica_geller Chandler, why would you do that?
chandler_bing Because it's awesome.
monica_geller You think this is clever?
chandler_bing Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.
monica_geller Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.
chandler_bing It is when you put it together with that one.
monica_geller Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.
chandler_bing Come on, he won't even know what they mean.
monica_geller Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.
chandler_bing Have you talked to him lately?
monica_geller All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.
chandler_bing No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!
monica_geller Honey you-you got to beat your scores!
chandler_bing With the claw?!
monica_geller All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.
chandler_bing Pull my finger--My hand is messed up.
rachel_green I am not gonna answer that!
joey_tribbiani Oh come on! Just pick one! Between Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, and Ross if you had to, if you had to, who would you punch?
rachel_green No one! They are my friends, I wouldn't punch any of them.
joey_tribbiani Chandler?
rachel_green Yeah, but I don't know why. Look at me, I'm having such a wonderful time!
joey_tribbiani Me too! Hey Rach, can I just say I think this is the best date I ever had!
rachel_green I know!
joey_tribbiani I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?
rachel_green Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.
joey_tribbiani I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.
rachel_green Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.
joey_tribbiani Huh. Huh.
rachel_green All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.
joey_tribbiani Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.
rachel_green So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?
joey_tribbiani Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.
rachel_green How do you do that?
joey_tribbiani Now you can't tell anyone, but uh...I put on shiny lip balm.
rachel_green Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.
rachel_green No, I don't want to tell you.
joey_tribbiani Why not?
rachel_green Because it's embarrassing.
joey_tribbiani More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!
rachel_green Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, "Hmmm." Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya
rachel_green All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Yeah. Me to.
rachel_green ...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!
dr_ross_geller No, I ran. It was really far, and when did people stop understanding the phrase, "Get the hell out of my way!"
rachel_green Well, why didn't you just take a cab?
dr_ross_geller Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?
rachel_green Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.
dr_ross_geller Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter.
rachel_green You what?
dr_ross_geller You've seen it, the Geller Yeller.
rachel_green Right. Wow!
dr_ross_geller Besides, I-I think I figured out a much faster route, I'm sure I can make it this time. I just...I just can't be afraid to get a little bit...hit by cars.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi! Hey, remember how last night we were talking about that movie Cujo?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, I still can't believe you haven't seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?
rachel_green Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!
joey_tribbiani Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?
rachel_green Yeah I know it's really boring, but it's like a big deal. Anyway, I was thinking about renting Cujo sometime.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah? All right, let's do it tonight.
rachel_green Well don't you have that big date tonight?
joey_tribbiani Oh right!
rachel_green Hey Joey, can I ask you something?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green After our date last night, did you feel a little weird?
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!
rachel_green I don't know! I'm-I'm kinda thinking it-it was the lobster
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah-yeah, the lobster.
rachel_green Yeah, I mean I was up sick all night.
joey_tribbiani Yeah me too, all night.
rachel_green Really?! How come we didn't cross paths?
joey_tribbiani Yeah well that's because uh...I stayed in my room. Yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.
monica_geller Okay, I got that. I'll escape over there. I'll come back over here. All right, come on Ms. Pac-Man. It's got-Right- Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?
phoebe_buffay Hey, you guys. Listen, I'm sorry that I was hogging the game before--Oh my God! Your friends have some unfortunate initials!
monica_geller They're all Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Chandler sucks! He couldn't have gotten this good!
chandler_bing I did. But it came at a price.
monica_geller But Ben is coming over tonight and he can't see this.
chandler_bing Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! Okay, why don't we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where... Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots. Okay, umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-
mable Hey. Are you all right? You seem a little distracted.
joey_tribbiani No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?
mable You mean like from behind?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.
mable Ew, y'know what? One time I saw this guy from behind and he seemed like a totally normal guy and then he turned around and it was Stephan Baldwin!
joey_tribbiani Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.
mable Totally! Wow! Would you excuse me for a sec?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, sure. Ehhh.
monica_geller Oh my God Phoebe, you're on fire!
phoebe_buffay I know!
chandler_bing One more score to go! You can do it!
phoebe_buffay Don't touch me!!
monica_geller Don't touch her!!
chandler_bing All right! Go left! Go left! Go right!! Go right!!
phoebe_buffay I can't!! I can't!! Noooooooo!!!!!!! You son of a bitch!!!!!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe!!
phoebe_buffay Oh hi Ben-No!! Don't look at the machine!
rachel_green Oh God! Thank God you're home! I'm watching Cujo.
joey_tribbiani Alone?!
rachel_green Yes! But what is wrong with this dog?!
joey_tribbiani Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?
rachel_green No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, it didn't work out.
rachel_green Oh. Do you want to watch the rest of the movie with me?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, okay. Yeah.
rachel_green Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me.
joey_tribbiani Oh sure, yeah, why not?
rachel_green Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!
joey_tribbiani All right, I know! I know. Yeah, it'll be okay.
rachel_green Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?
joey_tribbiani Terrified.
dr_ross_geller So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs
