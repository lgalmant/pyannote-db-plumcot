monica_geller Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...?
chandler_bing You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.
monica_geller I'll put a pillowcase over my head.
chandler_bing You're on!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller What's up?
phoebe_buffay Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...
dr_ross_geller .. finally...
phoebe_buffay Is that Ross?
monica_geller Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.
phoebe_buffay Sounds like he's with someone.
chandler_bing He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.
monica_geller Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.
charlie_wheeler Ooh... Dr. Geller!
dr_ross_geller God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.
monica_geller Oh my God, that's Charlie!
chandler_bing She's cheating on Joey with Ross!
phoebe_buffay Oh that tart... floozy... giant...
monica_geller I'm not sure about this.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.
monica_geller No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.
rachel_green Ooh... I love Barbados!
joey_tribbiani Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!
rachel_green I know, I'm her!
phoebe_buffay Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Get over here!
rachel_green ooh...
chandler_bing Wow!
monica_geller Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!
monica_geller Thank you.
rachel_green Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?
joey_tribbiani Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...
rachel_green What? Ross and Charlie? Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?
monica_geller I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?
chandler_bing How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!
monica_geller I'm on it!
chandler_bing Anything?
monica_geller I think I hear curtains closing...
phoebe_buffay We've got shoes being kicked off over here.
monica_geller Bedsprings, unmistakable!
chandler_bing You do realise that's your brother?
monica_geller Not until you said it. Somebody switch! Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.
chandler_bing That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.
monica_geller Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.
chandler_bing Okay Buckwheat!
phoebe_buffay You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn!
dr_ross_geller Weh...'sigh'
charlie_wheeler uhm... Is everything okay?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...
charlie_wheeler Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the.. I could just...
dr_ross_geller No, NO! Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.
charlie_wheeler I uhm... I completely understand.
dr_ross_geller Alright, I'm gonna go find them... I just need a... need a before I can... you know. Grandma... grandma... grandma... Okay, I see you later.
charlie_wheeler Okay...
phoebe_buffay That's the door. He's gone...
chandler_bing And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!
monica_geller Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what are you guys doing?
phoebe_buffay Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa...
monica_geller Yeah, we had a great time, thank you!
chandler_bing Bye!
dr_ross_geller Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?
chandler_bing He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it...
dr_ross_geller Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?
chandler_bing You got it!
dr_ross_geller Thanks! Thank you!
monica_geller Other wall, people! Other wall!
dr_ross_geller Rach, you there?
joey_tribbiani Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?
rachel_green Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. That's not nonchalant!
joey_tribbiani No idea what it means.
rachel_green Oh... okay, just hide!
dr_ross_geller Rach?
rachel_green Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!
rachel_green There's no room under the bed.
dr_ross_geller Is everything okay?
rachel_green Yeah...
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hi...
dr_ross_geller You know where Joey is?
rachel_green ..I really don't...
dr_ross_geller Can I talk to you for a minute?
rachel_green Yeah, sure...
joey_tribbiani I don't believe this... Have you guys been...
phoebe_buffay Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.
dr_ross_geller And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.
rachel_green Uh-huh... right... yeah...
dr_ross_geller And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.
rachel_green Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.
dr_ross_geller Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?
rachel_green That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.
dr_ross_geller You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.
rachel_green You would think!
rachel_green Joey!
joey_tribbiani Is he gone?
rachel_green How are you doing this?
joey_tribbiani Pssst...
rachel_green How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?
chandler_bing@monica_geller@phoebe_buffay YE-AH!
phoebe_buffay Now, what is this?
rachel_green Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!
phoebe_buffay Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?
joey_tribbiani Well, he's with Charlie now.
monica_geller Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?
joey_tribbiani You're a pain in my ass, Geller!
rachel_green All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...
chandler_bing Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?
rachel_green Sure...
chandler_bing Enunciate!
rachel_green Get out!
rachel_green Are they right?
joey_tribbiani Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.
rachel_green Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...
rachel_green Although...
joey_tribbiani I like although!
rachel_green I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...
joey_tribbiani Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...
rachel_green Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.
joey_tribbiani Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.
rachel_green No...
joey_tribbiani I'm thinking about you...
rachel_green Yeah...
joey_tribbiani Let's forget about Ross...
rachel_green Forgotten.
joey_tribbiani What's wrong?
rachel_green Nothing...
rachel_green Seriously... What is it?
rachel_green Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...
dr_ross_geller What's wrong?
rachel_green Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...
joey_tribbiani Well, maybe I can help.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again...
joey_tribbiani Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...
both#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode01 Yeah
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller You guys ready to go?
chandler_bing Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.
dr_ross_geller Dude! You're not taking your Bible?
chandler_bing You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?
dr_ross_geller Learn about Jesus...
dr_ross_geller Hey!
charlie_wheeler So, did you talk to Joey?
dr_ross_geller Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.
charlie_wheeler Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!
dr_ross_geller Stop it!
charlie_wheeler PHD
dr_ross_geller You're filthy!
phoebe_buffay Hey, have you guys seen Monica?
dr_ross_geller Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...
monica_geller Check it out!
phoebe_buffay Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!
chandler_bing Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!
monica_geller What do you think?
chandler_bing I think.... I think I can see your scalp.
monica_geller Don't you just love it?
dr_ross_geller Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.
charlie_wheeler It's so... something... You go girlfriend!
dr_ross_geller You've never said that in your life, have you?
charlie_wheeler Not once.
dr_ross_geller I thought so.
monica_geller And listen to this...
chandler_bing What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.
joey_tribbiani Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.
chandler_bing Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.
joey_tribbiani Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.
joey_tribbiani I understand...
dr_ross_geller No, I'll do it.
chandler_bing Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.
phoebe_buffay Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...
mike_hannigan You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...
phoebe_buffay Aaah... you're not good at this...
mike_hannigan You don't have to go home tonight, do you?
phoebe_buffay No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?
mike_hannigan Oh...
phoebe_buffay What?
mike_hannigan Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.
phoebe_buffay Why not?
mike_hannigan I have a date.
phoebe_buffay You have a... You have a date? With who?
mike_hannigan Oh, it's... my girlfriend.
phoebe_buffay You have... have a girlfriend?
mike_hannigan Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.
phoebe_buffay For how long?
mike_hannigan Three months.
phoebe_buffay Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?
mike_hannigan I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.
mike_hannigan Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...
phoebe_buffay You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.
dr_ross_geller Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".
charlie_wheeler Okay... Good luck.
rachel_green Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.
joey_tribbiani I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.
rachel_green Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.
joey_tribbiani Ooh...
rachel_green Still nervous?
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna get the lasagna.
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach...
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?
rachel_green Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...
joey_tribbiani You kissed.
dr_ross_geller Wha... What? What would give you that idea?
joey_tribbiani I saw you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.
joey_tribbiani Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.
dr_ross_geller Are you serious?
joey_tribbiani Yeah... Now I have something...
dr_ross_geller I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?
joey_tribbiani Oh... uh... look... before you...
dr_ross_geller No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...
joey_tribbiani I am those things, yeah.
dr_ross_geller You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...
joey_tribbiani Dude!
dr_ross_geller Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...
joey_tribbiani I can't think of anything.
dr_ross_geller Thanks!
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green So hi!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green So you eh, you talked to Joey?
dr_ross_geller Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.
rachel_green Oh! That's great!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
rachel_green Oh, so everything's okay?
dr_ross_geller Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.
rachel_green Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm so excited about this.
rachel_green Really? Excited?
dr_ross_geller Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...
rachel_green Excuse me! You didn't tell him, did you?
joey_tribbiani I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.
rachel_green Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.
joey_tribbiani Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.
phoebe_buffay Hi, Mike's place.
mike_hannigan Hey, it's Mike.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, that was fast.
mike_hannigan Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.
mike_hannigan One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.
phoebe_buffay Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?
mike_hannigan Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.
phoebe_buffay Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout.
precious Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?
phoebe_buffay I... I'm Phoebe.
precious Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Enchanté
monica_geller Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... Ow!
chandler_bing You go back to work tomorrow night, right?
monica_geller Yeah!
chandler_bing So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?
monica_geller Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. You like that, right?
chandler_bing What are you singing?
monica_geller It's "Bolero" from "10".
chandler_bing It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!
monica_geller You what? You said you liked them.
chandler_bing Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.
monica_geller Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.
chandler_bing Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.
monica_geller You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!
chandler_bing Hit yourself in the tooth?
monica_geller And the eye!
dr_ross_geller Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle?
rachel_green That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.
dr_ross_geller Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.
rachel_green Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.
dr_ross_geller Okay, shoot!
rachel_green Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.
dr_ross_geller OH NO!
rachel_green What? What is it?
dr_ross_geller Oh, major shampoo explosion!
rachel_green Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.
dr_ross_geller Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me?
rachel_green Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?
rachel_green Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...
dr_ross_geller Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?
rachel_green Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.
dr_ross_geller Duh, you think?
phoebe_buffay Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.
precious I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?
phoebe_buffay Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?
precious My name is Precious.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.
precious I just can't believe this... Why?
phoebe_buffay Well, I don't...
precious Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?
phoebe_buffay Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.
precious I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?
phoebe_buffay Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.
phoebe_buffay Okay, not a fan of the tough love.
precious I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.
phoebe_buffay But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...
precious He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever.
phoebe_buffay Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.
precious Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.
precious Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.
phoebe_buffay You're welcome!
chandler_bing Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?
monica_geller Not really.
monica_geller I have a problem.
chandler_bing Really? What happened?
monica_geller Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.
chandler_bing You can't move at all?
monica_geller Oh, well, I can move...
chandler_bing If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?
monica_geller I guess so...
chandler_bing Some of these look a little frayed.
monica_geller Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
joey_tribbiani So, did you err... did you tell Ross?
rachel_green Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.
joey_tribbiani No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.
rachel_green Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.
joey_tribbiani Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.
rachel_green Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...
joey_tribbiani I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.
rachel_green No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Good night!
rachel_green Goo--ood night!
joey_tribbiani Good night!
rachel_green Seriously, good night!
joey_tribbiani Stop saying good night.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Look what I found in the drawer... And you said I'd never wear this...
chandler_bing Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?
monica_geller Sure, what do you have in mind?
chandler_bing I think you know.
monica_geller Really? I don't really feel like it.
chandler_bing This is what I want to do.
monica_geller Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.
chandler_bing She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.
