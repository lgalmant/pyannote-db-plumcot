phoebe Hi.
nurse Hi.
phoebe Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
nurse Okay. Have you started having contractions?
phoebe Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
nurse Well
phoebe Oh my God!
ross It's all right.
nurse Now, which of you is the father?
phoebe Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
nurse Okay
rachel I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
joey Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
phoebe Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
ross Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
monica Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
chandler That's right.
rachel You-you're not wearing a jacket.
monica Oh man! I did it again!
phoebe Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
joey I gotta get the before shot!
rachel Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
phoebe What?!
ross Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
phoebe Oh my God, she's so stupid!
ross Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
phoebe That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
rachel Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
ross Yeah, he's head of the department.
phoebe All right-Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
monica What?
phoebe I'm having my first contraction!
chandler Oh no.
phoebe Ooh, it's not bad.
chandler Okay.
joey Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
chandler Hey! You okay?
joey Ooh, something hurts!
phoebe Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
joey Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
ross Hello.
dr_harad Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
chandler Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
monica That's what it sounded like.
chandler All right
frank Hey!
all Hey!
frank Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
phoebe No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
frank Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
chandler Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
frank Yeah.
rachel Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
joey Oh my!
rachel They're male nurses.
joey Not in my head.
rachel Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
monica Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
rachel What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
monica Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
rachel What?
monica Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
rachel Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
joey Yep! There's always room for Jell-O
rachel Joey, how do you make that dirty?
joey Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad
joey Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
phoebe Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either-Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
ross Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
joey Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
chandler Really? Male nurses?
joey Yeah, I was bummed too.
chandler So they're going on dates? When?
joey I think Saturday-.
frank What's with him?
phoebe Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
dr_harad Okay!
phoebe Hey.
dr_harad Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
chandler This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
dr_harad Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
chandler All right.
frank It's not that weird, is it?
phoebe It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
ross To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
phoebe What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
ross Again, it's not that he
chandler Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
monica Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
chandler Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
monica Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
chandler Fine! Maybe I will too!
joey Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
ross Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
phoebe Hi! And you're going into what grade?
dr_oberman Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early
phoebe Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
dr_oberman Oh no, I'm fully qualified to
phoebe Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
frank Oh cool! You made him cry!
joeys_doctor Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
joey Umm, well, what else could it be?
joeys_doctor It's kidney stones.
joey Or?
joeys_doctor Kidney stones!
dr_harad All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
phoebe They are. Why?
dr_harad They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
phoebe Happy birthday!
dr_harad Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
rachel Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
phoebe I know, it is.
rachel Yeah!
phoebe Can I tell you a little secret?
rachel Yeah!
phoebe I want to keep one.
rachel Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
rachel Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
phoebe Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
rachel Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
phoebe Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
rachel Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
phoebe Oh, just ask him!
rachel Me?!
phoebe I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
rachel No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
phoebe You're right.
phoebe Tell him it's for you.
monica Feeling a little better sweetie?
joey Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
monica Me too.
ross Hey! I just heard. What's up?
joeys_doctor Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
joey Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option-what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
phoebe So did you ask him?
rachel No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
phoebe Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
dr_harad Oh Fonzie.
rachel Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
phoebe Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
dr_harad Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
rachel Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
dr_harad Yeah, that's right.
monica Hey!
phoebe Hi!
monica How are you doing?
phoebe Okay, doctor says any minute now.
frank Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
phoebe Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.

joey They're so small!
dan So, I'll call you tomorrow.
monica Great!
chandler So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
monica Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
chandler Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
monica I think you're better than you think you are.
chandler Really? Okay, so
monica Know when to stop.
chandler Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
monica Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
chandler Right!
monica I think you're my favorite.
phoebe Which one do you have?
monica I don't care.
rachel Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
phoebe But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
rachel Yeah, umm, no honey.
phoebe Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
all Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
phoebe So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
monica Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
phoebe I know.
rachel So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
phoebe Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
chandler So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
phoebe They're gonna call her Chandler.
chandler That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
phoebe Works on you.
