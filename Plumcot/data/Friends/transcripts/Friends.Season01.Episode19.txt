rachel_green Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay.
monica_geller Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven.
rachel_green Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!
monica_geller Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
rachel_green Oh. Right...Oh great.
monica_geller What is it?
rachel_green Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration.' Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!
monica_geller Barry who you almost...?
rachel_green Barry who I almost.
monica_geller And Mindy, your maid of...?
rachel_green Mindy, my maid of. Oh!
monica_geller That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty. Lucky. To have had a friend like you.
dr_ross_geller Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice. Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'. 'Bring me the' and- Rach?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them.
dr_ross_geller Really.
rachel_green No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody.
dr_ross_geller Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?
rachel_green Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual...
dr_ross_geller Wait-wait. I, I got it. I was there.
rachel_green Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?
dr_ross_geller Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could-could curl your toes, might just be the one who...
monica_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller ..Gets interrupted. Hi!
rachel_green Hi, how was the movie?
monica_geller Wonderful!
phoebe_buffay So good!
joey_tribbiani Suck-fest.
chandler_bing Toootal chick-flick.
phoebe_buffay I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast...
joey_tribbiani Hey, I don't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity.
monica_geller There was nudity!
joey_tribbiani I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Hugh! Hugh Grant!
dr_ross_geller Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are.
chandler_bing They're still just friends, right?
rachel_green And I will see you tomorrow!
dr_ross_geller That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you.
monica_geller Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?
dr_ross_geller 'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there.
chandler_bing I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
joey_tribbiani I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.
chandler_bing I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?
dr_ross_geller I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me.
joey_tribbiani She really said that?
dr_ross_geller Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight.
joey_tribbiani 'Tonight' tonight?
dr_ross_geller Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey...
chandler_bing I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
dr_ross_geller Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her.
chandler_bing Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used.
rachel_green Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay- Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because- Marcel? Marc-
joey_tribbiani How could you lose him?
rachel_green I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-
monica_geller Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
rachel_green I don't know. The left one.
monica_geller Which ones?
rachel_green Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
all@ Hi.
phoebe_buffay Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?
chandler_bing Rachel lost Marcel.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, how?
monica_geller He- he pooped in my shoe.
phoebe_buffay Which one?
monica_geller Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
phoebe_buffay No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky...
rachel_green C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?
joey_tribbiani Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
chandler_bing Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room.
rachel_green Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna kill me!
monica_geller Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth.
rachel_green Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?
monica_geller Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you.
rachel_green Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
mr_heckles Whaddyou want?
monica_geller Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?
mr_heckles I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?
monica_geller No!
phoebe_buffay Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
mr_heckles I wasn't ready for it.
monica_geller A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
mr_heckles Saw Regis Philbin once...
phoebe_buffay Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles.
mr_heckles You owe me a waffle.
rachel_green Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face....with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?
rachel_green Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. You, uh, you want some?
rachel_green Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?
dr_ross_geller Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well-
rachel_green Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this.
dr_ross_geller Okay, quick and painful.
rachel_green Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me.
dr_ross_geller Oh, what? What-what?
rachel_green Y'know Marcel?
dr_ross_geller ..Yeah?
rachel_green Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him.
dr_ross_geller I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.
rachel_green I know, I know, I'm sorry-
dr_ross_geller No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.
rachel_green Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- Oh! Who is it?
intercom#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Animal Control.
rachel_green See? I've even called Animal Control!
dr_ross_geller You called Animal Control?
rachel_green Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
dr_ross_geller Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me.
rachel_green O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that...
dr_ross_geller That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!
rachel_green Hi, thanks for coming.
luisa_gianetti Somebody called about a monkey?
rachel_green Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't.
rachel_green Turned out it was a hat.
dr_ross_geller Cat!
rachel_green Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
monica_geller Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.
luisa_gianetti Marcel?
dr_ross_geller My uncle Marcel.
phoebe_buffay Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?
luisa_gianetti Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?
phoebe_buffay Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
monica_geller Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?
phoebe_buffay Yes, but there isn't always time!
monica_geller Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller.
luisa_gianetti Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!
rachel_green Yeah!
luisa_gianetti Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
rachel_green Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
monica_geller The Luisa from home room!
rachel_green Yes!!
luisa_gianetti You have no idea who I am, do you.
monica_geller No, none at all.
rachel_green None.
luisa_gianetti Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?
monica_geller Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!
luisa_gianetti Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch!
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?
luisa_gianetti I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine.
phoebe_buffay Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
chandler_bing Marcel?
joey_tribbiani Marcel?
chandler_bing Marcel?
joey_tribbiani Marcel?
woman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Hi, can I help you?
chandler_bing Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we-we were looking for something...
joey_tribbiani A monkey.
chandler_bing Yes have you seen any?
woman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?
joey_tribbiani Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?
woman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Of course.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Then, no.
woman_no_2#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Did I put too much rum in here?
woman_no_1#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey.
chandler_bing Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu.
joey_tribbiani Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?
chandler_bing Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot.
joey_tribbiani We can't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.
chandler_bing Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.
joey_tribbiani Marcel?
chandler_bing Marcel?!
phoebe_buffay Marcel?
monica_geller Marcel?
phoebe_buffay Marcel?
both#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Marcel?
phoebe_buffay Oh-my-God!
monica_geller Whaaat!
phoebe_buffay Something just brushed up against my right leg!
monica_geller What is it?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.
monica_geller Look, Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!
luisa_gianetti Step aside, ladies!
monica_geller What're you gonna do?
luisa_gianetti Just a small tranquiliser.
monica_geller Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah.
monica_geller Oh gosh.
dr_ross_geller Marcel?
rachel_green Marcel?
dr_ross_geller Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.
rachel_green Ross, you don't know that.
dr_ross_geller Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much.
rachel_green Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!
rachel_green Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.
dr_ross_geller Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...
rachel_green Ross.
dr_ross_geller I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...
rachel_green Ross.
dr_ross_geller Oh, forget it, okay?
rachel_green Ross!
dr_ross_geller What? What?
both#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode19 Hey! Hey, Bananaman!
phoebe_buffay Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea.
dr_ross_geller Hi, did you order some bananas?
mr_heckles What about it?
dr_ross_geller Gimme back my monkey.
mr_heckles I don't have a monkey.
rachel_green Then what's with all the bananas?
mr_heckles Potassium.
dr_ross_geller Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?
dr_ross_geller Marcel! What've you done to him?
mr_heckles That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.
dr_ross_geller Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon.
mr_heckles C'mere, Patti.
dr_ross_geller C'mere, Marcel.
mr_heckles C'mere, Patti.
luisa_gianetti Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha.
dr_ross_geller Okay, gimme my monkey back.
mr_heckles That's my monkey.
luisa_gianetti You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
mr_heckles That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.
dr_ross_geller Alright, I want my monkey.
luisa_gianetti No!
rachel_green Oh, c'mon, Luisa!
luisa_gianetti Sorry, prom queen.
dr_ross_geller You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.
rachel_green Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!
luisa_gianetti Nope.
rachel_green Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?
dr_ross_geller It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine.
rachel_green Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.
dr_ross_geller Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I...
rachel_green Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?
rachel_green That'd be good.
dr_ross_geller Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...
barry_farber Rachel.
rachel_green Barry?!
barry_farber I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Oh!
dr_ross_geller We have got to start locking that door!
monica_geller This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
phoebe_buffay Nope.
monica_geller That's because I'm in front of them.
chandler_bing Eh. I thought that was an alp.
monica_geller Well, high school was not my favourite time.
joey_tribbiani I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.
chandler_bing Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.
monica_geller Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?
phoebe_buffay Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
