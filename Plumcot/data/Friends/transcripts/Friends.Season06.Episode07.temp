rachel Now wait a minute. You just took all the words!
phoebe Uh-huh. You've met your match Rachel Green.
ross So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.
chandler And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.
monica Hey!
ross_and_chandler Hey!
monica Honey, that's a great idea nailing the boxes to the floor!
chandler I didn't nail the boxes to the floor.
monica Oh, So you can move them!
chandler Yes, and while I'm doing that, Ross has a great computer story for you.
joey Hey everybody! Uh, I'd like you to meet Janine. She's-she's gonna be my new roommate!
janine Hi.
ross Hi!
janine Hi
joey Yeah, she's gonna live with me!
monica It's nice to meet you. Janine...?
janine Lecroix. Janine Lecroix
joey I didn't know that! Well, what a pretty last name!
chandler So, uh, wh-where ya from?
janine Australia, I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.
joey From the land down under? I didn't know that either!
ross So uh, wha-uh, what do you do?
janine I'm a dancer.
joey You're a dancer? She-she's a dancer!
janine Well, I think I'll go and unpack.
joey Oh, hey let me.
monica Joey, did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?
joey Of course I did.
monica Uh-huh, what exactly did you ask her?
joey "When can you move in?"
ross Thank you for bringing her into our lives.
chandler Unbelievable
monica Oh, so you like her too Chandler?
chandler Hey, look at all the boxes!
joey Ugh, I cannot wait to ask her out!
monica Wait a minute...Joey. Joey you can't ask her out, she's your roommate. It-it'll be way too complicated.
ross Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.
chandler All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?
joey Oh God, yeah.
chandler Now imagine you live at the supermarket.
joey Okay!
chandler No-no
joey Oh, Oh, you're right! I don't want that. I can't date her!
monica Yeah and you better watch the flirting too, cause you know, in such close quarters, it could be trouble.
joey Well, that's gonna be tough Mon. I mean it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.
monica Hmm, well you're around me all the time and you don't flirt.
joey You a little sad about that sweetheart?
phoebe I have to tie my shoe, so you go ahead, I'll catch up.
rachel Okay.
phoebe Okay. Come on! That's not running! Let's go!
rachel You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs, she looks like a cross between Kermit The Frog and The Six Million Dollar Man.
ross Monica had such a crush on him. Yeah, she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.
rachel Oh! I used to do that too!
monica Did you also have his album, It's Not Easy Being Green?
rachel Aw, Mon...
monica So, Phoebe runs weird huh?
rachel Yeah, yeah and you know what, I know she's gonna wanna run again, I just don't know how to get out of it, I mean, I live with her.
monica Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.
ross Yeah.
rachel You're right, you're right. I should just tell her the truth.
phoebe Hey!
ross Hey!
rachel Pheebs, Monica tripped me, I don't think I can ever run again, ever!
phoebe Why? Why would you do that?
monica I don't know. Rachel I'm-I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.
rachel Ankle.
monica We'll see.
chandler OK, I'm officially unpacked. Thanks for helping me man. Joe? Well, I guess Joey went home. Oh and look, there's still one box that I have to unpack.
joey I Gotcha!!
chandler Oh my God! You-almost-gave-me-a-heart-attack.
joey Boy, it was so hard not to laugh, I tell ya. Hey, hey, the place looks great!
chandler Yeah, not bad right? You know what, Monica's gonna be working late, so I'm gonna make this place spotless. You know what else I'm gonna do, know what else I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go downstairs, I'm gonna get her some flowers. Now who wouldn't wanna live with me?
joey I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.
chandler Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?
joey Yeah. Well, so far yeah. But it's tough you know? I got all this built up flirting energy and I don't know how to get rid of it. How you doin?
joey Ohhhh man
janine Sorry, there's just more room out here.
joey No-no-no-no-no, it's-it's uh, you just uh, uh reminded me that uh, I need to do my stretches too.
janine Why don't you try to do-
janine What's wrong?
joey Uh-uh nothing. I-I-I-I didn't want you to touch me cause I'm -I'm all sweaty from the workout. I better hit the shower. Oh my God!
janine Oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there. It's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.
phoebe Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.
rachel No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!
phoebe Please Rachel, I am not an idiot.
rachel No, wait Phoebe.
ross Wow, couples who live together do start to look alike. So, Mondler...uh, what uh, what 'cha doin?
chandler What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!
ross Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?
chandler Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.
ross Put it back exactly where you found it?
chandler Yes I'm gonna put it back exactly where I found it.
ross 'Kay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.
chandler She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.
ross Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?
chandler She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.
ross Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.
chandler I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.
ross Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freak... out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.
chandler No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. Phone's done ehh.
monica Hi!
chandler Hey Mon, how's it going?
monica Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.
chandler Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.
monica It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.
chandler No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.
monica Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?
chandler It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! She's-she's gonna kill me.
ross Yeah, the phone was facing the other way. And that goes back up there.
chandler We should start with the big stuff. Y'know? That'll be the easiest. Uh, let's start with the couch. I got it.
ross Yeah that-that, doesn't look right.
chandler What are you talking about? The couch is perfectly in line with the carpet. And then I can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the... OK, OK, here's what we do, we just uh, move the couch closer to the coffee table.
ross Whoa, whoa, but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet.
chandler OK well here, we'll just move the coffee table closer to the couch.
ross Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.
chandler Yes, but the coffee table doesn't match the...blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds...Rooosss!!!!
joey Look, what am I gonna do? I'm not flirting but still, I'm drawing her to me like - like a moth to a flame! What the hell's going on over here?!?!? Monica's gonna kill you! Look I need your help, I have to do something to-to repel this woman! Wait a minute, wait a minute, you guys repel women all the time.
ross Hey, I've been married 3 times
joey No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?
ross Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.
chandler Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?
ross Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"
chandler Yeah, Monica doesn't like that either, Maybe I should stop doing that.
ross Oh y'know what, girls don't like it when I start talking about science.
chandler That's not specific to girls.
joey This is great, this is great, what else, what else?
ross Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.
chandler And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.
ross They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.
chandler Man, I'm so lucky I have Monica.
ross I'm never gonna find love again.
rachel Hey Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe Sure
rachel Okay, um, I... All right Phoebe look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry. OK? I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.
phoebe So, what should you have done?
rachel Well, I-I should've told you the truth.
phoebe Uh-Huh, Which is...?
rachel Well, y'know, the reason I didn't wanna go running with you is because um, well y'know the way that you run is a little...
phoebe So?
rachel Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.
phoebe Why do you care?
rachel Because they're people.
phoebe But people that you don't know and will never see again.
rachel Yes, but still. They're people... with eyes.
phoebe Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss . But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.
rachel I-I am not uptight - Hey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.
phoebe That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? The neighbor's dog.
chandler Okay, is this lamp in the same place?
ross Who cares? I repel women.
chandler No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no!!! You can't come in here! R-r-r-r-Ross is naked.
monica What?!
ross What?!
chandler I couldn't say that I was naked because she's allowed too see me naked.
ross Why does anyone have to be naked?
monica Why is Ross naked?
ross I-I had to show Chandler something?
monica Naked?
ross Yeah-yeah I uh, I have a uh, a guy problem.
monica Is it the same thing that Chandler had?
chandler Look, uh, just come later, we'll get everything squared away and you can come back later.
monica Okay, listen, there's still some of Chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom. Bye!
chandler Bye! Thank God
ross Dude, what'd you have?
chandler Look, we have no time okay? We must focus. We gotta get everything back into its original place.
ross The photo album! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album. We just go through it and match everything to the pictures.
chandler That's perfect! That's brilliant!
ross So really, what'd ya have?
janine Hey Joey, I got some beer for you.
joey Uh, don't you mean "for whom?"
janine Sure, listen I was gonna order some pizza, you wanna share one?
joey Pizza, heh, its not like I never had that before...ba dum bum cheshhh.
janine Is there something wrong?
joey All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.
janine Joey...
joey No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?
janine Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.
joey Oh!
janine No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.
joey Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.
janine I don't think so.
joey Oh, I do. How you doin?
janine I'm OK
joey What?!?!
janine What?
joey Oh dear God!
rachel Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Oh honey, I'm so sorry, you were right, this feels great!
phoebe See? And you don't care if people are staring, it's just for a second cause then you're gone!
rachel Gone! I mean its amazing Pheebs. I feel so free and so graceful. Hey! Look out for the horse! Sorry!
monica Is it okay for me to come in now?
chandler Uh-huh
monica Why is everything different?
ross Bye!
chandler No, I don't see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it.
monica Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.
chandler Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
monica It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?
chandler Do you want me to be afraid of you?
monica Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.
chandler Really?
monica Of course!
chandler Oh well you're the best. You come here to me.
monica All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?
ross So it said that by the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer...
janine ...and live forever as a machine!
ross That's so Janine, you-you-you know what, do you know we're doing right now? You and I, we're interfacing.
janine Yeah, I gotta go.
chandler Ba dum bumb cheshhh!
