chandler Okay, well tonight's the big night.
phoebe Yeah!
joey Okay listen, how are you gonna ask her?
chandler It is going to be perfect. I am taking her to her favorite restaurant. I'm going to get her a bottle of the champagne that she really loves; therefore knows how expensive it is. Then when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast I'm just gonna propose.
rachel Ohh
joey That sounds perfect!
chandler Yeah.
joey You're gonna mess it up let me do it.

chandler Well, Monica and Chandler can't go. We're going to dinner remember?!
rachel Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
monica What's the big deal?
chandler I just get mad when Rachel doesn't remember where we're going.
joey Where are you going?
rachel How about you guys?
phoebe Open bar?
rachel I think so.
phoebe I can do that for the kids.
joey Hey, y'know what? I'll come too. I'm making money now; it's about time I give something back.
chandler Well, you could also give back the money you owe me.
joey Okay. Have a benefit.
ross Hey!
rachel Hey! Ross, listen can you come to a charity event tonight?
ross Oh no, I have plans with Elizabeth.
chandler Oh, so you're already doing your part for the kids.
ross I'm sorry, it's just one of my last nights together before she leaves for camp-to be a counselor!
monica Ross let me ask you a question. All jokes aside, where is this relationship going?
chandler Wait a minute, all jokes aside? I didn't agree to that!
monica Do you really see this as a long-term thing?
ross I don't know.
phoebe Y'know, you are 12 years older than her.
ross Wait a minute, does-does everyone feel this way?
all Yeah! Yeah, sort of. I'm sorry.
ross Uh-uh-Wow! Uh, I thought you guys were just like making jokes, I had no idea. What you know what? You guys are wrong. Uh yes, there is a chronological age difference but I never notice it. You know why? Because she is very mature. Besides, it doesn't really matter to me what you guys think. I mean, I'm the one dating Elizabeth, not you!
joey That's not what she said last night.
rachel See? Now, he could date her.
chandler Will you marry me? Will you marry me? Hey, you marry me! What's going on little elves?

rachel Well now it's an empty bar.
phoebe You just can't stand anyone else enjoying themselves can't you?
mr_thompson And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman's day sailer sailboat. The winning bid was a whooping $20,000!

mr_thompson Congratulations on your new boat, Joey Tribbiani!!

phoebe Forget her! You enjoy this!! (Pulls him back up and starts applauding again. Joey waves and does a salute.]
monica What are you doing?
chandler One nation, under God. Indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I remembered it. The champagne is here.
monica Are you okay?
chandler Yes! Yes! I'm good! Are you good? Are you good? Is everything-are you-are you perrr-perfect?!
monica Yeah. I'm okay. I'm actually-I'm a little cold, can I have your jacket?
chandler Oh, yeah. Uh, no you can't have my jacket! Because then I would be cold! If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should've brought your own jacket. But uh, other than that, are you okay? Are you okay?
monica Are you sure you're okay?
chandler Yes! I'm fine. In fact I've been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
monica Ohh that's sweet!
chandler Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn't imagine growing old with
monica Oh my God!
chandler I know, but just let me say it.
monica Oh my God, Richard.
chandler What?! I'm Chandler! Oh, that's Richard!
monica Oh God, maybe he won't see us. Richard!
richard Monica! Chandler!
chandler Hey-hey, hey! I don't know why I did that!
monica Hey, it's good to see you!
richard You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
monica Yeah-Oh that's right. You, you always wanted me too. Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
richard Well, my nose got lonely.
chandler And uh, you don't have a mustache which is good. I'm Chandler; I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
richards_date Hi, I'm Lisa.
chandler Hi.
richard Oh, I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler. We used to date.
chandler Richard! No one supposed to know about us! See I, did it again.
monica Chandler, wh-why don't we sit down?
chandler Yeah, I'll sit down.
monica It's good to see you
richard Oh. Good to see you guys.
chandler Yes.
richard That might be fun.
rachel What were you thinking?!
joey I didn't know it was an auction!
rachel Wh?!
joey I figured, take a guess, help a charity, free boat!
rachel Why would a charity give away a free boat?!
joey I don't know! Charity?
rachel Ugh!
phoebe Well, just buy the damn boat!
rachel Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?
phoebe I'm just helping the kids!
rachel How is you drinking helping the kids?
phoebe Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.
mr_thompson Mr. Tribbiani.
joey Oh hi!
mr_thompson Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
joey Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?
mr_thompson I think it was valued at 19,000
joey Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.
rachel Joey! Joey, good one!
mr_thompson That's good. Very good!
joey So uh listen, I think I'm gonna take off now.
rachel Hey! You...can't...leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!
joey Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I don't have that kind of money!
rachel I know. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what we're gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then you're just gonna pay the difference.
joey Okay.
rachel Okay.
joey Look, I don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Y'know? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
rachel Not great.
monica And so, we're hiding in the bathroom.
richard And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.
monica So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they're going at it right on the bathroom floor.
lisa Oh my God!
chandler I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.
richard It's so great seeing you guys again. I'd like to make a toast. Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it's morning and is refreshed."
monica Ohh.
chandler What?!
ross Oh my God, you guys!!
chandler Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!
ross Who?
chandler Richard!
ross What? A-ohh! Ohh. Oh that's right that's right. That's Richard's favorite place too.
chandler Oh you knew that. Good!
monica I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
ross Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
monica Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can't get out of!
ross Y'know, maybe she is too young for me. Y'know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I don't know what to do.
monica Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.
ross Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, I'm-I'm 12 years older than she is.
monica If the school finds out you're fired.
ross Hmm.
monica She's leaving for three months.
chandler For camp!
ross Okay, good stuff. Umm, well she's-she's sweet and pretty and
monica Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didn't you?!
ross No! No! I...didn't do that. It's just... Okay, honestly no. I don't, I don't see a big future with her.
monica Okay well I think...that's your answer.
ross I've got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.
chandler Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if you're not careful you may not get married at all this year!
joey Rach! Rachel! Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
rachel Oh great!
joey Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
phoebe Oh, okay.
rachel Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?
phoebe It's a trip for two! Excuse me. Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?
emil_alexander That was me.
phoebe Oh, en chante.
joey Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
mr_bowmont That's me.
joey Ahh, yes.
rachel Oh well, hello. This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
joey You-you have to pay that! It's not just a guess.
rachel Okay. Okay.
mr_bowmont I was actually relieved uh I didn't win the boat. My wife would've killed me.
rachel Ohh
joey Are you kidding me?! She's gonna this boat!
rachel Y-Yeah! What-what is your wife's name?
mr_bowmont It's Pam.
rachel Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
joey Aw-awww!
mr_bowmont I don't think she'd like that.
rachel Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."
joey Oooooh
mr_bowmont I don't think so dear.
rachel Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. All right, you are settin' sail up the Hudson! You've got the wind in your h--arms! You-you get all that peace and quiet that you've always wanted! You get back to nature! You can go fishin'! You can-ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you're old, Cappy.
mr_bowmont What the hell, it's for a good cause! All right!
joey No way! It's mine!!
rachel What?! What?!
joey All that stuff you just said? I want that!
rachel But Joey you don't have $20,000!
joey Who cares?! I-I'll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!
joey Oh my God, you're back!
phoebe Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand!
monica Why do you want to see my hand?
phoebe I wanna see what's in your hand. I wanna see the trash.
joey Yeah.
phoebe Eww! Oh, it's all dirty. You should throw this out.
monica Okay.
chandler What did you guys just do?!
phoebe What happened?
chandler Richard was there so I couldn't do it!
joey What?! Noooo
chandler I'm gonna do it tomorrow y'know, and-and surprise her, but now you've ruined it!
joey We didn't ruin it!
chandler Who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?!
phoebe Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor
joey Glove salesman!
phoebe Good one! Yeah.
chandler This is terrible. What am I going to do?
phoebe Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
chandler That's right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
phoebe Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!
chandler I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.
joey Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
monica I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!
joey That guy's still doing that?!
rachel Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!
phoebe No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!
ross Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didn't seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?
elizabeth Ross! Wait!
ross Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking about
elizabeth You suck!!
ross What?!
ross Okay, break-up's still on!
chandler Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?
joey Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. I never noticed that before.
monica Hi guys!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
monica What are you up too?
chandler Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
joey Yeah, Big Brother.
monica Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
chandler Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
monica Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!
chandler Eh
monica Okay well that's good to know.
joey The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!
waitress Hey Monica, there's a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
monica Sure, I love this part!
waitress Come on in.
richard Hi!
monica Richard!
richard Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef.
monica Ohh... Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So what's up?
richard Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
monica Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
richard No! I came here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
monica What uh-What did you-What?!
richard I still love you. And I know I probably shouldn't even be here telling you this, I mean you're with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he's straight I'll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn't tell ya I'd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.
monica Y'know you're really not supposed to be back here!
richard Well yeah, I'm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.
monica Oh God... Why don't they put chairs back here?!
richard I know this is crazy but am I too late?
monica What the... Yes you're too late! Where was all this three years ago?!
richard Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Y'know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
monica What were you doing in Africa?
richard Working with blind kids.
monica Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-I... I'm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
richard Okay that's fine, I'll walk away. And I'll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandler's willing to give you everything I am.
monica Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, I'm the one that's making him wait!
richard You are?
monica Yeah!
richard Why?
monica Why? Because of the government.
rachel Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.
phoebe I know, they're gonna be so happy together.
rachel Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
phoebe Not that often!
rachel No! I'm so happy for them!
phoebe Me too! So happy for them!
rachel I'm so happy and not at all jealous.
phoebe Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!
rachel I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.
phoebe Totally. I'm like 90/10.
rachel Yeah me too.
joey Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
rachel Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
monica So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?
chandler Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!
monica Yeah, but that's pigs not people!
chandler If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.
monica Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
chandler Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.
monica Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!
chandler Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!
monica Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!
chandler It's okay, I got a plan.
rachel We're gonna find love!
phoebe Definitely!
rachel Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
phoebe What do you mean?
rachel Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.
phoebe You mean a backup?
rachel Exactly!
phoebe Yeah, yeah I got that.
rachel You do?
phoebe Hm-mmm.
rachel Who?
phoebe Joey.
rachel Joey?!
phoebe Yeah!
rachel Are you serious?!
phoebe Yeah, I locked him years ago!
rachel Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.
phoebe Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
rachel Oh, seriously?
phoebe Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were
rachel Charming.
phoebe Well hey, it's just a backup.
rachel Yeah.
joey Hey Monica!
monica Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?
joey This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?
monica Yeah, it's great.
joey Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!
monica I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!
joey Chandler giving you a hard time huh?
monica It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!
joey Well, you know Chandler.
monica No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.
joey Maybe you changed?
monica I didn't change!
joey Maybe that's the problem.
monica What?!
joey Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
monica Is that some kind of boat talk?
joey I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.
monica What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?
joey Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!
monica Well there's some people who do want to marry me.
joey There are?
monica Yeah! Richard!
joey R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!
monica That's right.
joey Chandler loves marriage!!
monica You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!
joey You got that from what I said?!
narrator When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
ross What happened you guys?
ross Rach!
rachel Hey you!
ross Hey, come on in.
rachel Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
ross Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.
rachel Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?
ross I guess so.
rachel So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "What's that?!"
ross Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.
rachel Exactly.
ross Ohh, yeah I already have one.
rachel What? Who?
ross Phoebe.
rachel Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.
ross Ohh, I don't think so.
rachel Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!
ross That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.
joey Where the hell have you been?!
chandler I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
joey Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!
chandler What?!
joey Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
chandler My-Oh my God!
joey I know! They suck!!
chandler He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!
joey I know!
chandler Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!
joey Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!
chandler You're right.
joey Yeah!
chandler Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!
joey Okay.
chandler Okay great.
joey Dude-dude-dude!
chandler What?!
joey Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
monica Hi.
richard Hi.
monica I don't know why I'm here.
richard I didn't ask. You wanna come in?
monica I don't know.
richard Oh, okay. Well, I'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
monica Chandler is such an idiot!
richard Drink?
monica Yeah, I'll have a scotch
richard ...on the rocks with a twist? I remember.
monica Still smoking cigars?
richard Uh, no! No! That's...art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.
monica No that's, that's okay.
richard So Monica let me ask you a question. Y'know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
monica Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.
richard Oh really?
monica Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.
richard Who is it?
monica Edward Nevski?
richard Yeah he's no good. Do you ever think about me in a non-eye doctor way?
monica No.
richard Ahh.
monica But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.
rachel Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!
phoebe Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!
rachel What?!
joey Hey!
ross Hey!
joey Phoebe! We're both your backup?!
ross Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!
phoebe I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!
joey No we weren't!
ross I was not!
phoebe Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!
rachel Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!
joey Pick me!!
ross No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!
phoebe All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!
joey This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
ross Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!
phoebe No wait! Just-Okay-Just wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Don't make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
rachel Oh God, Phoebe!
phoebe I'm talking about massages.
rachel Oh.
rachel Okay, y'know what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what we're gonna do! I'm gonna write Joey on one napkin and I'm gonna right Ross on the other napkin and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?
joey Okay that's fair.
ross All right.
phoebe Good!
rachel Pick one.
phoebe Left! Thank you.
rachel You're welcome.
phoebe Ross!
rachel Joey! We should just switch.
phoebe Yeah absolutely!
joey Yeah.
monica I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!
richard Excuse me?
monica Oh! Him.
richard Oh. Whew!
monica I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-up's apartment! Y'know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
richard Yeah! You're saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.
monica Y'know, let's face it, I'm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don't want that!
richard I think that's fair.
monica Fair? Please don't even talk to me about fair! Fair would've been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would've been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!
richard It's okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. Shhhh.
monica Nothing. I don't kn-Umm. I don't know. Umm
richard I know.
monica Y'know, I-I... I have to figure...some st-Y'know, some stuff before I can
richard Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. I'll be here. Not smoking.
richard Chandler.
chandler Where is she? I'm not scared of you!
richard She's not here and please come in.
chandler Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!
richard Okay, she was here, but she left.
chandler Well where did she go?
richard Well she said she had to think things over.
chandler Oh my God, I can't believe this! Y'know, I thought...I thought you were a good guy.
richard Oh, hey look nothing happened.
chandler Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didn't tell my girlfriend that you love her?
richard Well all right, one thing happened?
chandler Y'know what? I can't believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!
richard Well I'm sorry.
chandler And what does she have to think about? I love her!
richard Well, apparently I'm willing to offer her things that you are not.
chandler But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y'know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she'd be surprised!
richard Well if it helps, it worked very well.
chandler It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn't fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! I was gonna propose tonight.
richard You were gonna propose?
chandler Yeah I even got a ring. Did you get a ring?
richard No I don't have a ring! You go get her Chandler. And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, don't let her go. Trust me.
chandler Y'know Richard...you are a good guy.
richard I know. I hate that!
joey Dude!
chandler I can't talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!
joey She's gone.
chandler What?
joey She's gone. She had a bag and she left.
chandler What are you talking about?
joey She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
chandler Well why didn't you stop her?! Why didn't you just tell her it was a plan?!
joey I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldn't believe me.
chandler Well where... Where did she go?
joey To her parent's I think and she said you shouldn't call her. But if I were you I would.
chandler I can't believe I ruined this.
joey I am so sorry man.
monica You wanted it to be a surprise.
chandler Oh my God.
monica Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
chandler Okay! Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
monica Yes.
monica I knew you were likely to take a wife!
joey Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
monica Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
rachel Ohhh, this is the least jealous I've ever been!
phoebe Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isn't here!
monica Oh
rachel Oh hell, he's done this three times! He knows what its about!
joey Yeah!
