chandler Do you think that there's a town in Missouri or some place called Sample? And ah, as you're driving into town there's-there's like a sign, and it says "You're in Sample."
monica Hey.
all Hey!
rachel How'd it go with Pete?!
joey Tell us!
monica You're not gonna believe this. Okay, so I go over...
billy_crystal I'm sorry. Ex-excuse us. I'm sorry, it's a little crowded. Do you mind if we...
robin_williams Yeah, could you scooch?
billy Yeah, move over just a little bit.
robin Keep on scooching.
monica So guys, listen, I go over there, and umm...
robin Why? Why?! What's wrong with me?!
billy What's the matter?
robin I have a feelin'... I, my wife is sleeping with her gynaecologist.
billy How do you know?
robin Well y'know, he's got access.
billy Yeah.
robin Y'know it's that feeling you get, y'know?
billy Like when you go bowling and you know you're in somebody else's shoes?
robin That's the one.
phoebe All right, so, so you went to Pete's...
ross What happened?
monica I...
robin Why is this happening to me?! I don't know, maybe it's my wound.
monica Forget it.
billy So it's-it's not heeled yet?
robin No-no, it's ooozing, oozing. Could you pass me the cream? Is there any-Oh, there's the cream.
billy Thomas, this is gonna be hard, but I wanted it to come from me, and nobody else.
robin What is it, Tim?
billy It's me, I've been sleeping with your wife.
joey So you're the gynaecologist?
billy Hey, I'm trying to have a private conversation! Is that okay?!
robin Ooh, Can I have a napkin, please? Could you please hand me a napkin? Would you--Give me this thing all right!! Enough! And you are no longer my friend! We are finished! Nada!! No more! You are a bastard for doing this!! Get away from me!!
billy Thomas, come back here!
phoebe So Monica, what were you gonna tell us?
monica I have no idea.
rachel So, come on, what was the big news Pete wanted to tell you Mon?! Or should I say Mrs. Monica Becker?
phoebe No-no-no oh, keep your name, don't take his name.
monica He didn't ask me to marry him.
all Ohh.
phoebe Well then definately don't take his name.
monica He wanted to tell me he's gonna compete is some ultimate fighting competition thingy.
the_guys Pete?!
rachel Why?! What is it?
monica I don't know exactly. It's-it's sorta like wrestling.
phoebe Oh?!
monica Yeah, but without the costumes.
phoebe Oh.
joey And it's not fake, it's totally brutal.
chandler Yeah, it's two guys in a ring, and the rules are: "They're are no rules."
monica So you can like, bite, and pull people's hair and stuff?
ross Yeah, anything goes, except ah, eye gouging and fish hooking.
monica What's fish hooking?
ross Huh, what's fish hooking... Thanks man, that would have been really hard to describe. What is that taste?
joey What? My hands are totally clean, I just gave the duck a bath.
doug So thanks for the warm welcome. It's good to have you guys on my team, and I come to play. I hope you do too. Now, let's go out there and get 'em! Huh? And remember, there is no 'I' in team.
chandler Yes, but there's two in martini, soo everybody back to my office.
doug You! Chuckles! What's your name?
chandler Oh it's Bing, sir. I'm sorry , I was just ah...
doug No-no, I heard what you said, funny. I like funny. This team is about hard work, but it's also about having fun. Good to have you aboard Bing!
ross That's right, Ryder. Wynona Ryder for six. Thank you. Yeah, we have the reservations.
rachel Yes!!
chandler All right buddy, way to go!
ross Dude, what are you doing?
chandler Thank you! Today, my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal.
phoebe Yeesh, what'd you do about it?
chandler Well, I didn't do anything. I didn't want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom.
monica I gotta tell ya, I think it's okay to be that guy.
joey Yeah, maybe it's like y'know, that jock thing. Y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns.
rachel Y'know I don't, I don't understand guys, I mean I-I would never congratulate Monica on a great stew by y'know, grabbin' her boob.
chandler Yeah, I know, for a really great stew you just y'know, stick your head in between 'em.
monica Okay, can we please go eat?
joey Yeah. What are we getting?
monica Anything but stew.
ross All right so, Chandler, from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you. Y'know just ah, don't turn your back to him.
joey Yeah, or you can teach him a lesson. Y'know? What you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt, all right? Then, when he goes to smack ya, his hand will smell. Now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?
chandler What if Joey were president?
phoebe Umm, hey Rach, can I ask you something?
rachel Yeah.
phoebe Okay, you can totally say no, but umm, would it be okay with you if I set Ross up on a date?
rachel Oh, ah with who?
phoebe Umm, my friend, Bonnie. She just always thought Ross was really cute, and now that you two aren't together, she asked if I could set it up, but if you're not cool with it...
rachel Oh-oh-oh, which one is Bonnie again?
phoebe You remember her from my birthday party two years ago. She's yeah, like, average height, medium build, bald...
rachel Oh! That's fine.
phoebe Great! Okay, good for you!
hoshi You are iron. You are steel! Let me ask you something, how come when I call your computer support line, I have to wait an hour and a half?
pete I told you, we're adding new operators all the time. Could we concentrate on my training?
hoshi It's just hard when I know I have e-mail I can't get!
monica Hi!
pete Monica! Hi honey.
hoshi All right, on the table.
monica Hey, umm, so listen umm, my friends were telling me a little about this ah, ultimate fighting thing and it, well it sounds really dangerous. I-I don't want you to get hurt, 'cause I kinda like you.
pete Oh, believe me, I don't want to get hurt either. I'm being smart about this. See these guys? They're the best trainers in the world, and Hoshi here used to be a paid assassin. A house painter! He used to be a house painter.
monica Promise me you'll be careful.
pete I promise.
monica Hey, are we still on for tonight?
pete Yeah.
monica Okay, good, 'cause umm, well maybe we could have a little workout of our own...
hoshi No! No boom-boom before big fight!
monica How 'bout just a boom?
rachel Well that was depressing, I think I just bought a soft pretzel from one of the kids from Fame. Ready to go to the movies?
phoebe Um-hmm. Oh wait! This is Bonnie.
bonnie Hi!
rachel This is Bonnie? This is Bonnie? You're Bonnie?
bonnie I can show you an ID if you want?
rachel Oh no, I'm sorry, you look a lot different from the last time I-I saw you.
bonnie Oh yeah, well I just started wearing bras again.
rachel Oh, that must be it.
phoebe Well I hope you have fun tonight.
bonnie Thanks! You too.
rachel You said she was bald.
phoebe Yeah, she was bald, she's not now.
rachel How could you not tell me that she has hair?
phoebe I don't know, I hardly ever say that about people.
rachel Ohh, well, this is just perfect!
phoebe Well I'm sorry, I thought you said it was okay.
rachel Yeah, I said what was okay when I thought she was some weird bald chick. I mean, y'know, that girl has hair got all over head!
phoebe Well, maybe it won't work out. Maybe Ross won't like her personality.
rachel Why, does she have a bad personality?
phoebe Oh no, Bonnie's the best!
doug Bing! Read your Computech proposal, a real homerun. Ooh. Barely got ya that time, get over here. Come on. Wham! Good one. That was a good one. Keep at it team.
chandler What is with him?
phil With him? You're is favourite, you're his guy!
stevens We never get smacked.
chandler Well, that's not true, he-he smacked you once.
phil Not on purpose, he ricocheted of you and got me.
stevens I'm telling you, I need some smacks. I got a kid starting Dartmouth in the fall.
doug Dartmouth? Who went to Dartmouth? Dartmouth sucks. Did you go to Dartmouth Bing?
chandler No sir.
doug There you go.
ross Hey!
monica God Ross, what is that?
ross Yeah, it's the Ultimate Fighting Combo. Yeah, I saved thirty cents, plus I get to keep the cup. Yay!!
announcer From New York City, New York! Appearing in his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut! He's known for his confrontational business style. Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing Pete Beck-errrr!!
monica I love you, Pete!!!
announcer And his opponent, from Hunnington Beach, California! He's a 300 pound street fighter, Tank Abbottttttt!!!!
monica Pete! Pete!! That guy's pretty huge!
pete Don't worry, Hoshi taught me how to use an opponent's strength and weight against him.
ross Well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.
ross All right! You go get him! Let's go!
referee Here we go gentlemen, here we go! Are you ready? Are you ready? Let's get it on!!
pete Uh-oh.
monica Hey! It's me. Mon-i-ca! Can I just tell you how proud I am of you.
pete It would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant "You suck!"
monica I mean I-I thought you were nuts at first, but you-you did it. And now you can just look back at this thing with no regrets.
pete What, look back?
monica Well, you're not gonna get going are you?
pete Well let me ask you a question. Am I the Ultimate Fighting Champion?
monica Well, no. But...
pete Well I'm not gonna stop until I'm the Ultimate Fighting Champion.
monica That guy stood on your neck until you passed out!
pete Let me tell you a story. When I set out to create Moss 865, do you think it just happened overnight? No. There was Moss 1, that burnt down my Dad's garage, there was Moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in January, and 862 others that I learned from, just like I learned from this fight, never to let a guy stand on my neck.
monica You didn't know that already?
pete Look, I'm gonna get better. Okay? I promise you.
monica Okay, just get a lot better. Fast.
pete Oh, one other thing. Hoshi thinks that you being ringside may have affected my concentration.
monica Yeah. That-that was the problem.
monica Hey.
ross Hey! How long until Pete's fight?
monica Oh, about five minutes. Right now they're interviewing his opponent. Apparently he trains by going to Iran and pulling the arms off thieves.
ross Hot dog?
monica Four, please. I'm really nervous. Thank you.
phoebe So Ross, how umm, how did it go with Bonnie?
ross What? Oh! I gotta tell you, I-I wasn't expecting to like her at all, I mean I actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now, but she's really terrific.
phoebe Ohh, that's too bad!
ross No, I-I'm saying I liked her.
phoebe Yeah, y'know what, there are other fish in the sea.
ross Pheebs, I think she's great. Okay? We're going out again.
phoebe Okay, I hear you! Are you capable of talking about any thing else?
chandler Hey! Which one's my turkey burger?
ross Ahh, the one next to my foot. Sorry.
joey Hey, the fight's starting!
ross Okay, we'll be right in. So ah, did your boss try to slap you again today?
chandler Nine times! Okay, I had to put on lotion! But, it's gonna be okay, because as of tomorrow I'm conducting an experiment, and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack free.
joey Fight's over!
chandler Excuse me, Doug? Hey there sports fan!!
doug Bing! You got those numbers for me?
chandler No, I ah, I didn't do them.
doug Oh, you forgot?
chandler No, no I just ah, didn't do them. Instead, I ah, hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so I certainly don't deserve any praise, verbal or otherwise.
doug Well, I got tanked myself last night. Pretty dicey drive home, Tapanzi Bridge never looked smaller. That's okay, you're still my number one guy! Bing!
chandler Doug!!
doug Hmm.
chandler I'm a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself.
doug Oh, is it the swearing? I mean is it the constant swearing? Because I gotta tell ya, if it is, you can just... kiss my ass!
chandler No, no. It-it's not about the swearing, it's more about ah, the way, that you ah, occasionally, concentrate, your enthusiasm on my buttock.
doug Oh?
chandler Oh, and don't get me wrong, I appreciate the sentiment. It's just that I, I have a rather, sensitive posterior, and ah, besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.
doug Well, say no more. Y'know it takes guts to bring this up. Bing! You're okay.
chandler Okay.
doug Ha! Ahhhhhhh!
chandler Ahhhhh!
phoebe Okay. Would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant, or inside his shower drain?
rachel Oh my God! Phoebe look, it's Ross and that girl.
phoebe No! No! Look at that! It's a line of ants! They're working as a team!
rachel Phoebe!
phoebe Right, oh yeah. Wow, oh, it looks like Ross is breaking up with her. Uff, I hope he lets her down easy. Let's go.
rachel Come on Phoebe, look at that! They are not breaking up, look at them. Okay that's, you know what that is? That is a, that is a second date, that's what that is! Look at that, she just put her hand on his thigh...
phoebe Oh no! That really is nothing, she is very sexually aggressive.
rachel Ohh! Phoebe, this is all your fault! Now he loves her, he's gonna marry her, and this is all your fault.
phoebe You said it was okay!
rachel You said she was bald!!
phoebe What?! What-what-what-what-what?!!
rachel Phoebe, we can't, we just can't just let it happen! Okay, we have to do something! We have to break them up! Okay? Just go in there and like, shave her head! You owe me one bald girl!!
phoebe Okay, first of all, breathe. Second of all, I don't get it. Aren't you the one that decided that you didn't want to be with Ross?
rachel Yes.
phoebe Well isn't he your friend? Don't you want him to be happy?
rachel Yes.
phoebe So?
rachel I just y'know, I didn't expect him to be this happy so soon. Ufff. Ooo-ooh!
phoebe Oh no.
rachel What?
phoebe Oh, we killed them all.
rachel Oh!
pete It's okay, it's not as bad as it looks, it's a precaution. Ah, I'm not supposed to move my spine.
monica Please tell me you're stopping now.
pete I'm fine! I'd fight tonight, if they'd let me. See this circle I'm marking off here? This is my zone of terror.
monica You are insane! You-you gotta give this up!
pete I can't until I'm the ultimate fighter. I will do it. I'm telling you, the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight, me or Superman. Now, I'm not saying I could beat Superman, but y'know, kids are stupid.
monica Sit down. All right? Please, just listen to me. You are terrible at this! Okay? You are the worst ultimate fighter ever! Ever!!
pete Y'know I have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm, and a severely bruised Adam's Apple, but that really hurt.
monica Well then, y'know what? I care about you to much to watch you hurt yourself like this. So if you have to do this, then you're gonna have to do it without me.
pete Well if you're asking me to quit, then you're asking me to be someone I'm not. I've got to do this.
monica Then I've gotta go. Bye.
pete Mon-Monica?
monica Yes?
pete Could you leave a note? 'Cause I'm on a lot of pain killers now, and I don't know if I'll remember this tomorrow.
doug So, in conclusion, the lines all go up , so I'm happy. Great job team! Tomorrow at 8:30. Phil! Nice job. Stevens! Way to go! Joel-burg, you maniac! I love ya! Bing! Good job, couldn't have done it without ya.
chandler Thank you, sir.
stevens Oh, excuse me. I forgot my briefcase y'know, by accident.
doug Of course, you did. Forgot something else too ya bastard! Well, what about you? You're not feeling left out or anything are ya?
chandler No. No, not at all, that's-that's ridiculous.
doug Everybody else got one, and you want one too. Don't you?
chandler Ye-ye-yeah, yes I do!
doug Now get on out of here, you!
tv_announcer Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just...
chandler Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!
rachel Oh, I can't watch this.
joey Check it out, he's winning! Pete's winning!
monica Really?!
joey No-o-o!!
tv_announcer Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area.
all Oh! Oh!
phoebe Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?
ross Well, this is ironic. Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't.
all Ohh!!
