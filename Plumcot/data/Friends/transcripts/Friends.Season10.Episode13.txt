joey_tribbiani Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
phoebe_buffay Oh, why? What's up?
joey_tribbiani I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my résumé, I'm fluent in.
dr_ross_geller Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
monica_geller Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
dr_ross_geller It was ok...
rachel_green I did not know you spoke French.
phoebe_buffay Oui, bien sur je parle Français! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
rachel_green Oh... you're so sexy!
joey_tribbiani Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
phoebe_buffay Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
rachel_green Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Why are you wearing my apron?
monica_geller I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
chandler_bing Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller You guys know where Rachel is?
monica_geller No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
dr_ross_geller So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller These are for Erica!
dr_ross_geller What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
monica_geller Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
dr_ross_geller So, why is Erica coming to visit?
monica_geller Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
chandler_bing Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
monica_geller Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
dr_ross_geller Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
rachel_green Ross...
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
rachel_green My father had an heart attack....while I was at Barney's.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God.
monica_geller Honey.
chandler_bing I'm so sorry...
dr_ross_geller Is-is he ok?
rachel_green Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
rachel_green No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
dr_ross_geller Still-still, let me come... for me.
rachel_green Ok. If you really need to.
dr_ross_geller I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
rachel_green Oh, I really could.
dr_ross_geller Oh!
rachel_green Ohh...
phoebe_buffay All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".

joey_tribbiani Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
chandler_bing Why would you say that?
phoebe_buffay Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
erica I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
joey_tribbiani Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
erica Oh yeah, let's do that!
chandler_bing Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
rachel_green Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
dr_ross_geller And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
rachel_green Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
rachel_green Can somebody please go in?
nurse Absolutely.
dr_ross_geller Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
rachel_green Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
dr_ross_geller I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
nurse He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
dr_ross_geller I'm feeling better.
rachel_green Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
nurse Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
rachel_green Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
dr_ross_geller He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
rachel_green Ok.
dr_ross_geller Did the TV wake you?
dr_leonard_green No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
dr_ross_geller Ouchy.
dr_leonard_green What are you doing here, Geller?
dr_ross_geller Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
dr_leonard_green Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
dr_ross_geller Right, is it painful?
dr_leonard_green What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
dr_leonard_green So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
dr_ross_geller Nope, just the one. RACH!
phoebe_buffay Je m'appelle Claude.
joey_tribbiani Je do call blue!

dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
rachel_green Uh. Did you call your parents?
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
rachel_green Oh good.
dr_ross_geller Wow.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
rachel_green What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
rachel_green Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
dr_ross_geller Sorry. You ok?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller You had a rough day, uh?
rachel_green Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
dr_ross_geller But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
rachel_green Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
dr_ross_geller What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
rachel_green Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
dr_ross_geller No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
rachel_green Ok, maybe you're right.
dr_ross_geller Good night.
rachel_green Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
dr_ross_geller Sure!
rachel_green Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
dr_ross_geller Oh, of course...
rachel_green Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
dr_ross_geller Me too. Come here.
rachel_green I just don't want to be alone tonight.
dr_ross_geller Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
rachel_green Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
dr_ross_geller No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
rachel_green Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
rachel_green Wow. Ok.
dr_ross_geller I'll see you in the morning
rachel_green Mhm-mh!
dr_ross_geller Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
erica Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
monica_geller Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
chandler_bing New York is awesome!
monica_geller What is with you?
chandler_bing Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
monica_geller Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
erica Thanks so much for showing me around.
monica_geller Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
erica Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...
chandler_bing Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
erica Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.
chandler_bing That's great.
erica Yeah... it's almost definitely him.
monica_geller How's that now?
erica Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
chandler_bing So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
erica No, he's in prison.
monica_geller Was he falsely accused of something?
erica No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
chandler_bing I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
monica_geller Are you awake?
chandler_bing Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
monica_geller Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
chandler_bing Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
monica_geller Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
chandler_bing I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
monica_geller How?
chandler_bing I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
monica_geller Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
chandler_bing Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
the_guy_on_the_tape We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
joey_tribbiani Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
the_guy_on_the_tape Good job.
joey_tribbiani Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Hey Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
joey_tribbiani Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
phoebe_buffay Really, can I hear some of it.
joey_tribbiani Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
phoebe_buffay Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
joey_tribbiani Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
phoebe_buffay How could you possibly think that?
joey_tribbiani For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
rachel_green Sure.
dr_ross_geller You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
rachel_green Hmm-hmm.
dr_ross_geller You sure you're alright?
rachel_green Yep.
dr_ross_geller O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
rachel_green FYI..
dr_ross_geller There it is...
rachel_green In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
dr_ross_geller Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
rachel_green Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
dr_ross_geller Well...
rachel_green Oh stop that!
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
rachel_green Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
dr_ross_geller Hey, I was looking out for you.
rachel_green Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
dr_ross_geller I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
rachel_green Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
dr_ross_geller Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
chandler_bing Hey! How was lunch?
erica We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob
chandler_bing Oh, really?
erica No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
chandler_bing O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
monica_geller Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
chandler_bing Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
monica_geller No it's not.
chandler_bing How do you know?
erica Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
chandler_bing Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
monica_geller The thing we never do.
chandler_bing Shovely Joe!
director Whenever you're ready Joey.
joey_tribbiani Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
casting_assistant I'm sorry, what's going on?
joey_tribbiani Dude, come on! French it u-up!
director Joey, do you speak French?
joey_tribbiani Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
director You know what. I think this audition is over.
phoebe_buffay Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am Reginé Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of Estée Lauder.
director You really think this man is speaking French?
joey_tribbiani Sa-sa-saw!
phoebe_buffay écoutez, je vais vous dire la vérité. C'est mon petit frère. Il est un peu retardé.
phoebe_buffay Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui...
director Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
joey_tribbiani Ah. All right. But my French was good?
director It was great.
joey_tribbiani Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
phoebe_buffay Merci. Au revoir.
joey_tribbiani Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
dr_ross_geller Emma's down for the night.
rachel_green Oh, good.
dr_ross_geller So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
rachel_green Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
dr_ross_geller Oh, no problem.
rachel_green And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
dr_ross_geller Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
rachel_green It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
dr_ross_geller Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
rachel_green Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
dr_ross_geller Oh, ye-ah!
rachel_green You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
dr_ross_geller ..Valentine's day...
both#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode13 Oh yeah!
rachel_green Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
dr_ross_geller Hmmm-mmmm.
rachel_green Not even one more time?
dr_ross_geller Not even once.
rachel_green No matter how much we want it.
dr_ross_geller Even if we want it really bad.
rachel_green That's what we decided.
dr_ross_geller Uhm, right!
rachel_green ..It's kinda hard though!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
dr_ross_geller ..I hate waste.
rachel_green ..Ross?
dr_ross_geller Yes?
rachel_green Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
dr_ross_geller Damn it. It's never off the table.
phoebe_buffay Okay, can you really tapdance?
joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay It's off the resumé.
phoebe_buffay Archery?
joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay Horseback riding?
joey_tribbiani Would fall off a lot.
phoebe_buffay You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
joey_tribbiani That I can do.
phoebe_buffay Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
joey_tribbiani All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
phoebe_buffay Ready... GO!
phoebe_buffay You did it!
