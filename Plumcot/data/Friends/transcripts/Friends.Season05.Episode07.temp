chandler Are you looking at naked tribe's women?
joey No, look.
chandler That's a pig.
joey I know, I know, but look at the knobs on her.
chandler Hey!
ross Emily's cousin kicked me out!
chandler What?!
joey Why?
ross Well, when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce, sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back.
chandler How can he do that? Didn't you sign a lease?
ross Who needs a lease when it's family!
joey Hey, you can stay with us! We'll take care of ya!
chandler Oh, yeah! Absolutely! Anything you need man! But you have to promise me the second you are feeling better so that we can make fun of your hair!
joey Yeah.
ross You got it.
joey Okay.
ross Thanks you guys, I really appreciate this. All right, I'm gonna get packing again. Man, I've been moving around so much I'm beginning to feel like a nomad.
ross What?
chandler He thought you said gonad.
health_inspector Wow, Monica, if every restaurant is as clean as yours, I'd have a tough time making a living.
monica Oh, Larry.
phoebe Umm, do health inspectors work on commission?
larry No, bribes.
phoebe It's okay to laugh right?
larry Yeah, I was just kidding.
phoebe Okay.
larry I'll check the kitchen floors.
monica Okay, knock yourself out, Larry.
phoebe Yum-my!
monica Larry?
phoebe Oh yeah! I'd let him check out my kitchen floors.
larry A 98. I deducted 2 points because you are not wearing your chef's hat, and that is a Section 5 violation.
monica Uh, look, Larry honey, umm, I wrote the book on Section 5 and I know that you don't have to wear your hat unless you're in the kitchen.
larry And where is your hat?
monica It's in the kitchen, I'll go get it.
larry Ahh that's the 2 points.
phoebe Hey, you should really read that book you wrote. Wow! You saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she'd have to go in there hatless to get it. You can have your own health inspector detective show!
larry Oh, I don't know about that.
phoebe Yeah, but then I can be you sidekick Vunda.
larry Maybe uh, Vunda could give me her number and I can ask her to dinner sometime.
phoebe Okay, she would love that! Y'know, 'cause you know all the clean places to eat.
larry I-I'll call ya.
phoebe Okay.
phoebe He's so funny!
monica Thanks.
rachel Thank you. Mon?
monica Hmm?
rachel How's Ross doing? Y'know since all the Emily stuff.
monica He's not great umm, but he's dealing with it. Oh wait a minute, you're not gonna try
rachel Oh, honey, please, no, I can't get started with all that Ross stuff again. I mean, he's gonna screwed up for a looong time. And besides y'know, I don't, I don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
monica Right, you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married.
danny Two pounds of Moca Java please.
monica Danny. Are you guys ever gonna go out again?
rachel I don't know! He hasn't called me since that one time when we went out. I see him in the hallway, we flirt, I'm all ha-ha-ha-ha, and nothing.
danny Hey!
rachel Hi Danny! Wow! Thirsty huh?
danny Uh, actually, actually, I'm having a party at my place on Saturday, it's sort of a house warming kind of thing.
monica Ohh, fun!
rachel Ohh, great!
danny Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it.
rachel Yeah.
danny Okay, see ya.
monica Well, I guess we won't be warming his house.
rachel Okay. All right, I see what he's doing! He's not asking me out, because he wants me to ask him out.
monica And you're not gonna do that.
rachel That's right! 'Cause that would give him the control! So now he's all ooh, coming up with this whole I've got a party thing y'know, trying to get me to hint around for an invitation. Blew up in his face, didn't it?
monica So-so there is no party.
rachel No, there's a party. There's a party. But the power, that is still up for grabs. You follow me?
monica I think so. Se, he-he's not inviting you to his party because he likes you.
rachel Exactly.
joey Ross?
ross Hey roomies!
chandler Love what you've done with the place.
ross Oh, yeah I know, I know, it's a lot of boxes, but again I really appreciate you guys letting me stay here.
joey Not a problem. And listen, hey! Since you're gonna be here for a while, why don't-I was thinking we uh, put your name on the answering machine.
chandler Oh yeah!
ross Oh, I uh, hope you don't mind, I kinda uh, jazzed it up a little. Check this out. We will, we will, call you back!
joey Hey, all right!
ross Pretty cool, huh?
joey You're fake laughing too, right?
chandler Oh, the tears are real.
larry You look beautiful this evening.
phoebe Show me the badge again.
phoebe Shiny.
larry Oh, will you mind if I wash up? Because I came straight from work and who knows where these babies have been.
phoebe You are just nonstop!
larry We're outta here!
phoebe Why?!
larry Just walking past the kitchen I saw 10 violations! I'm shutting this place down!
phoebe You have the power to do that?
larry This does.
phoebe Shut it down.
joey Hey.
chandler What are you doing?
joey Nothing.
chandler You built a fort didn't ya?
joey Kinda.
chandler Oh my God, the air purifier! Ross's air purifier! All I heard through 4 years of college was
joey Dude, you should've gone out once and a while.
chandler I hate this thing!
joey Come on, Chandler, Ross is our friend. He needs us right now, so why don't you be a grown up and come and watch some TV in the fort!
rachel Oh, hi Danny.
danny Hey guys, I just uh, wanted to invite you to the party tomorrow night.
monica Oh, thanks! We'll try to stop by.
rachel Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna be busy.
monica You are?
rachel Yeah! Remember I got that uh, gala.
danny Yeah, what's the gala for?
rachel It's a uh, regatta gala.
danny Really! You-you sail?
rachel No-no, but I support it.
danny Okay, hope I see you tomorrow night.
monica Okay.
danny Take care.
rachel Okay. Walked right into that one didn't he?
monica What one? You wanted him to invite you to the party and he did it!
rachel Yeah, but he waited until the last minute! So if I said yes, he would know I had nothing better to do than wait around for an invitation to his stupid party. I said, "No!" Which puts me right back in the driver seat.
monica Great. So the ball is in his court?
rachel Ball? There is no ball.
ross Joey, please!
joey Sorry.
joey Ahhhhhhhhhh
chandler Hello children!
joey Hey! Wanna play some foosball? Please?
chandler Okay.
joey No-no, no! We have to move the table into my room, yeah! 'Cause of all the boxes. Come on!
joey All right, I have one question. What is the deal with this?
chandler Bye-bye little puppet Joey hand?
joey No, the quiet down thing!
chandler You mean this.
joey Um-hmm! Look, I-I-I don't know how much more of this I can take! Did you know he taped over my Baywatch tape with some show about bugs! My God! What if that had been porn?
chandler All right look, y'know, this maybe tough but come on, this is Ross! I survived college with him!
joey All right, I guess I can hold out a little longer. Let's have a game.
chandler Okay.
chandler No-no-no-no!
joey YES!!
ross Uh fellas,
chandler Okay, so he's out of here.
joey Um-hmm.
joey Hey!
monica Hey!
joey You guys got anything to eat? I just went down to Johnos for some chicken and it was closed!
phoebe Oh, I took Larry there to eat but it was all violated. So we shut it down!
joey Pheebs, if this guy keeps closing down all of our favorite places, where are we gonna eat?!
monica I don't know, clean places?
joey Umm, yum!
monica It's Danny.
rachel Don't let him in! I'm supposed to be at a regatta gala.
monica We'll be right there! Can't you just say it starts later?
rachel What? What kind of a regatta gala starts at night?!
monica The fake kind!
danny Hey, hi, I need a ladle. You got a ladle?
monica We have a ladle.
danny Thanks, see you at the party.
monica Okay, great!
phoebe Hey, guys, you know what Larry would say? He would say, "See you ladle."
chandler Well, I-I-I'm done with this. You want anything Ross? Sports? International? Apartment listings?
ross I'll take sports.
joey Mine!
ross All right. Uhh, international.
joey Oh that's mine too! I'm Italian!
ross Well, I guess I can check out those apartment listings, even though there's never anything in here.
chandler Not even on page 7?
ross Oh yeah! You're-hey, you're right! Here's an affordable place, two bedroom, close to work, ooh, it's available in five weeks!
chandler What about that circled one?
ross Oh, I-I don't know, it's kind of expensive for a studio.
joey But it's available now! Isn't it?
chandler Yes, it is.
joey Hey, let's go look at it!
ross Okay, let's go.
joey Okay!
chandler There we go!
ross Oh-oh-ooh, hey guys, I was wondering if you guys would uh, maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier? I mean after all, we all are using it.
chandler Let's go quicker.
joey Yeah!
ross Oh my God!
chandler Yeah, well look at this kitchen, slash bathroom. Well that's great! Y'know so you can cook while in the tub.
joey Somebody was using his head. Hey, let's check out the rest of the place.
ross I think this is it. I don't know, maybe we should keep looking.
joey But hey, Ross, this place is available now!
chandler Yeah, you don't want to be stuck with us for the next five weeks.
joey Yeah.
ross So, you-you think I should go ahead and take this place?
joey Oh, it's perfect!
ross How about you?
chandler It's a kitchen slash bathroom.
ross All right, I see what you guys are saying. I'll uh, I'll go downstairs and fill out an application.
chandler We are bad people.
joey He knew we were trying to get rid of him. He knew! You think we could get a bathtub in our kitchen?
larry Hey, ready for dinner?
phoebe Ooh, absolutely!
larry Great! How about you wanted to go the Italian place down on Bleaker Street right?
phoebe Ooh, I love that place! So, no.
larry How about Mama Lisettie's?
phoebe Enh. Sure!
larry I wonder how long that milk has been setting out.
phoebe Oh, no-no, this place is totally healthy! That-this milk is mine. I bought this today, 'cause I was thirsty for milk, y'know. Okay, let's go!
larry Hey, buddy! Are you familiar with Section 11-B of the Health Code that requires all refuse material out the back exit?
gunther But then I'd have to go all the way around the dry cleaner place.
larry Oh, so you're saying you'd choose convenience over health?!
phoebe Okay, stop! Larry, okay, can't you just be Larry and not Larry the health inspector guy? Y'know I mean it was really exciting at first but now it's like, okay, so where are we gonna eat ever?
larry Well, I suppose I could give him a warning.
phoebe Thank you. Okay, go! Go! Go! Now, if after dinner you still really need to bust someone, I know a hot dog vendor who picks his nose.
joey Maybe, maybe we did a good thing, helping Ross get back on his feet!
chandler Yes that was a nice place!
joey Yeah!
chandler Not a lot of closet space, but he can just hang his stuff out the window in a bag!
joey Yeah!
chandler What are we gonna do?
joey I don't know. Maybe pizza?
chandler About Ross!
joey Oh! Oh!
joey Hello! Oh yeah! It's the apartment manager; Ross put us down as references. Ross is the greatest guy you'll ever meet! Yeah, he's very reliable.
chandler Of course he has this big huge dog! That uh, barks into the night. Well, who doesn't love dogs? Ah, he's a tap dancer! Yes, some would say that is a lost art. He's a pimp! There you go! Yes, he's a pimp. He's a big, tap dancing pimp! Hello?
chandler Ohhhhh!
rachel Shoot, shoot, this is never gonna work! He's right there!
monica Just go over and say hi.
rachel No, I have to go downstairs and come back up as if I'm coming home from the regatta gala. Okay? So just go distract him. But don't be sexy.
