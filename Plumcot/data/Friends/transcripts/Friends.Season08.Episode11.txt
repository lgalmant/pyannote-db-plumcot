rachel_green Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
rachel_green Look at that guy by the window, wow!
phoebe_buffay He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.
rachel_green Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.
phoebe_buffay Wait a second! This is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay This is completely normal, around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy.
rachel_green Really?! So this has happened to you?
phoebe_buffay Oh absolutely yeah! Oh and keep in mind, now, I was carrying triplets so in, y'know, medical terms I was-I was thrice as randy.
rachel_green Wow! This explains so much! Last weekend, I went from store to store sitting on Santa's lap.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Yeah, I remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of Evander Holyfield from a Foot Locker.
rachel_green Ah.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green Well, y'know what? I go see my doctor tomorrow, I'll ask her about this. Maybe she can give me a pill or something.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Yeah, that's what you need a good...pill.
mona Hey! Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
mona Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.
dr_ross_geller Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?
joey_tribbiani Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.
dr_ross_geller Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?
mona Oh yeah, probably at the end. Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!
joey_tribbiani I'm missin' picture time?!
phoebe_buffay Y'know she has a face Ross!
mona Okay. Okay, here's a good one of us.
dr_ross_geller Wow! That is a good one! Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y'know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.
mona Y'know, every year I say I'm gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it. Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?
dr_ross_geller Together? Like-like to people?
mona Yeah, y'know. Happy holidays from Mona and Ross. It'll be cute, okay?
dr_ross_geller Okay.
mona Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?
dr_ross_geller Uh sure, sure.
mona Bye guys.
phoebe_buffay Bye.
joey_tribbiani Congratulations! You just got married!
dr_ross_geller I know. Can you believe that?
phoebe_buffay Wait, I'm-I'm sorry. What's the big deal about a holiday card?
dr_ross_geller Married couples send out cards, families send out cards, people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards! What-what is she crazy?!
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey, hey that's your wife you're talking about!
doug Bing! Ho! And the Bing-ette!
chandler_bing Honey, you remember my boss Doug right?
monica_geller Yes, hi.
doug Hi. So good news, the divorce is final. I signed the papers this A.M.
chandler_bing I didn't know you and Carol were getting divorced, I'm sorry.
doug Sorry? Finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap. Hey, congratulations to you guys though!
monica_geller No leg-chewing for us sir.
doug Oh well, give it time. So the divorce, the marriage, we've got a lot to celebrate. How about we all go out to dinner tomorrow night?
monica_geller I can't think of anything we're doing. Why can't I think of anything we're doing?
doug Tomorrow night it is then, I should be out of court by six. They keep throwing these sexual harassment cases at me and I keep knocking them out of the park!
monica_geller Okay, I'll see you tomorrow! Just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow. I-I cannot spend another evening with that man. Do you remember how he behaved at our wedding?
chandler_bing No.
monica_geller That's because he wasn't invited because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.
chandler_bing Oh yeah. Boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture doesn't it?
mona Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
mona Hey, I went by the photo shop, take a look, here is a mockup of our card. What do you think?
dr_ross_geller Huh. Wow, this is great.
mona Now, do you think it should say, "Love Ross and Mona?"
dr_ross_geller Well, we-we haven't said that to each other yet, but I guess its okay to say it to other people.
mona How many did you want? I'm getting a hundred.
dr_ross_geller A hundred?! Well, I-I guess I'll take a-Mona, uh...I-I'm not sure about the whole uh, card thing.
mona Really? Why not?
dr_ross_geller Sending out a holiday card, together, I mean I just don't know if we're really quite there yet.
mona Oh y'know, I didn't think of it that way. You're right. You're right. So, can I ask you a question?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
mona Where are we?
dr_ross_geller Huh.
mona Y'know, like where are we? Where is this relationship going?
dr_ross_geller Hmm
mona I mean I love spending time with you, y'know I just-I hope we're moving forward. I mean, we should probably talk about that. Don't you think?
dr_ross_geller Let's do the card!
mona What?
dr_ross_geller The card! I think we're there!
mona Okay. I-But I think we should still have this conversation.
dr_ross_geller Really?! I mean, even with the card?
the_nurse Hi!
rachel_green Hi!
the_nurse Just so you know, Dr. Long can't be here today, she was called to the hospital, so Dr. Schiff will be seeing you.
rachel_green Oh, okay. Hey, can I ask you a question? Was it me, or-or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? Y'know who I'm talking about, bald haircut, hairy fingers
dr_schiff Hi Rachel? I'm Dr. Schiff.
rachel_green Yes, you are.
dr_schiff So, how's it going?
rachel_green Oh, really, really good. But enough about me, come on! Where-where are you from? What do you do?
dr_schiff I'm a doctor.
rachel_green Right! Right! I-I actually meant in your spare time, do you cook? Do you ski? Or do you just hang out with your wife or girlfriend?
dr_schiff Uh, I don't have a wife or girlfriend, but I do like to ski.
rachel_green Oh, I love to ski! How amazing is this?!
dr_schiff So, are you experiencing any discomfort?
rachel_green No. I'm very comfortable.
dr_schiff Any painful gas?
rachel_green No! Shoot, Dr. Schiff what kind of question is that?!
dr_schiff Okay then, would you like to lie down on the table?
rachel_green Well would you like me to lie down on the table?
dr_schiff I'm sorry, is there something going on here?
rachel_green Do you feel it too?
rachel_green Hi.
phoebe_buffay Oh hey! So, how did your doctor's appointment go?
rachel_green Well, let's see. Uh, they gave me cute doctor today and in the middle of the exam I put my pinky in his chin dimple.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God.
monica_geller Why did you do that?
phoebe_buffay Okay, remember that little problem I was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?
monica_geller Oh yeah, the Evander Holyfield phase. Oh man you were so hard up you practically came on to me.
phoebe_buffay You wish.
monica_geller Hey, I could've had you if I wanted you.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah? Come and get it.
rachel_green Okay, even this is turning me on!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Oh hey! Hey Ross! Hey how's it, how's it going with you and Mona? Are you guys still together?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, yeah we're moving forward. You'll be getting our card!
monica_geller You and Mona are doing a holiday card together?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, we're not just doing a card! Y'know, she-she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.
phoebe_buffay Ugh! Women!
dr_ross_geller I know! I know! Why do you guys need to have this conversation?! Huh? I mean no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "So, where is this going?"
rachel_green Uh Ross? You asked me that.
dr_ross_geller Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.
monica_geller Like asking her to move in with you?
dr_ross_geller Smaller than that.
monica_geller Making her a mixed tape?
dr_ross_geller Uh, bigger than that.
phoebe_buffay Give her a key to your apartment.
dr_ross_geller Whoa-hello! We were closer with the mixed tape.
monica_geller All right. Have you said, "I love you?" You could say, I love you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah I-I don't-I don't think I'm quite there yet, but I could say I looove spending time with you.
phoebe_buffay No, we hate that.
monica_geller That is a slap in the face.
dr_ross_geller Forget it. I-I-Y'know what? I'll just have the conversation. I'll just say I like things the way they are, and hope for the best. What do you think Rach?
rachel_green I think, if it was a little colder in here I could see your nipples through that sweater.
doug Bing! We're all set for tonight, 8 o'clock.
chandler_bing Oh uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. Monica has to work.
doug Oh, my ex-wife didn't work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.
chandler_bing Oh uh well tomorrow's no good for her either.
doug Oh? Why not?
chandler_bing It's the semi-finals...of her...botchy ball tournament.
doug What's going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?
chandler_bing Well now-now you're just talking crazy.
doug So why can't the three of us go out together?
chandler_bing Because uh...we-we...we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.
doug Good God Bing I...well I can't say I'm altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there. And the way she looked at me, pure lust.
chandler_bing Y'know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?
doug Bing my boy, we're gonna get you over this. Now here's the plan, grab your coat, we're going to a strip club.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak. But to hell with that bitch.
dr_ross_geller Here we go. Mona umm, I think it's time we-we had a conversation about-about where things are with us.
mona Yeah, I-I think I suggested that.
dr_ross_geller Aw, we-we are so... So umm, well I-I-I like you and I-I love umm, y'know hanging out with you. And I mean-I'm having a lot of fun.
mona Okay.
dr_ross_geller I mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if-if it's just fun. It's gotta be, it's gotta be going somewhere right? So where-where is it going? Ah! That's-that's the real question. And-and the answer is...is it's going somewhere...fun. Now I-I know what you're thinking, fun was fine for you like ten years ago y'know, but you're-you're not getting any younger. No I mean-No not you, not you, you-you are getting younger. I mean-you-you look like you're getting younger by the second-What's your secret?
mona I'm sorry, so umm, so where are we?
dr_ross_geller Well, well to sum up, we're having fun, you look young.
mona Okay
dr_ross_geller But that's not enough. So... So...here's a key to my apartment.
mona Really?!
dr_ross_geller Really.
mona You don't think this is too fast.
rachel_green You gave her a key to your apartment?!
dr_ross_geller Not just a key, I gave her the only key! I am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Ooh Ross! How'd the conversation go?
dr_ross_geller Oh great, I live on the street.
phoebe_buffay Where?!
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hi! Okay, Monica, Rachel, this is my friend Roger.
roger Hey everybody.
monica_geller Hi Roger.
phoebe_buffay So umm, I'm gonna get us some drinks. Would you help me out?
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Umm, he's here to have sex with you.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay You're welcome.
rachel_green Phoebe no!
phoebe_buffay It's okay, he's a virgin.
monica_geller Rachel umm, I was just talking to this guy and I think he'll have sex with you.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, okay let's leave these two alone.
rachel_green No! I do not care what my hormones are doing, I am not going to just do it with some random guy!
phoebe_buffay Fine! Then you tell Roger because he was really looking forward to this!
doug Oh Bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together. Let me buy you a lap dance with those girls. Huh?
chandler_bing Oh that's all right sir, and that's just one girl.
doug Bing-What's this?!
chandler_bing It's a hand. It's a thing you use as a Jack and Coke holder.
doug No, it's a wedding ring. You gotta get rid of it. We're gonna go to the East River right now and throw it in there!
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no!
doug Oh yeah-yeah-yeah, y'know I did it and I felt a hell of a lot better and if you whip it just right you might hit a seagull in the head.
dr_ross_geller Okay, and oh I'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys. Apparently I give them away for no reason at all.
mona Hey Ross, what's going on? You changing the lock?
dr_ross_geller No. That guy is.
mona I don't understand. You-you give me a key to your apartment and then you change the lock.
the_locksmith Good luck buddy.
mona Umm, I-I thought we were moving forward and now you're-you're sending me all these mixed signals. What are you trying to tell me?
dr_ross_geller I'm trying to tell you I made you a mix tape.
mona What?
dr_ross_geller I love you!
mona Ohh! And I love spending time with you.
chandler_bing Hi honey I'm home.
monica_geller From the tequila factory?
chandler_bing It was awful. To get out of going to dinner with Doug I told him that you and I split up. So then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars, and then when I wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird!
monica_geller Come here. I can breath through my mouth.
chandler_bing Y'know what the worse part was? I got to see what my life would be like without you. It was like It's a Wonderful Life with lap dances. Please promise that you will never leave me, that we will grow old together, and be with each other for the rest of our lives.
monica_geller I promise. Hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?
chandler_bing Ooh, I don't know if we're there yet.
rachel_green Yes. Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Okay, can I ask you a question? Is-is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? Very Ambercrombie & Fitch. I'll call you back.
joey_tribbiani Who was that?
rachel_green It's just the pizza place.
joey_tribbiani You hung up on the pizza place? I don't hang up on your friends.
rachel_green I'm sorry honey, I'm just having a, having a rough day.
joey_tribbiani Oh, what's wrong?
rachel_green Oh you really, you really just don't want to hear about it.
joey_tribbiani Then why did I ask?
rachel_green Okay, it's just-and this is really embarrassing-but lately with this whole pregnancy thing I'm just finding myself...how do I put this umm, erotically charged.
joey_tribbiani Is that college talk for horny?
rachel_green Yeah. So y'know, I have all of these feelings and I don't know what to do about them, because I can't date like a normal person, which is fine because I don't need a relationship, I mean all I really want is one great night. Just sex, y'know? No strings attached, no relationship, just with someone that I feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing. For just one great night, I mean is that really so...hard...to find. So how was your day?
joey_tribbiani Good, I uh, I saw a pretty big pigeon.
rachel_green Well, I gotta get up early and it's almost seven o'clock.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I gotta, I gotta go to my room too.
rachel_green Okay, good night!
joey_tribbiani Good night.
joey_tribbiani I can't do it!
rachel_green I didn't ask you to do it!
joey_tribbiani You're Rachel!
rachel_green You're Joey!
joey_tribbiani You're my friend!
rachel_green Right back at ya!
joey_tribbiani But plus, it would be wrong and weird and-and-and bad.
rachel_green And so bad. I don't even know what you're talking about because I didn't ask you to do anything!
joey_tribbiani I know!
joey_tribbiani Do you wanna do it?
rachel_green No!
joey_tribbiani All right, me neither! I was just testing you!
rachel_green That's the end of this conversation!
joey_tribbiani This conversation never happened!
rachel_green Never happened! Good night!
joey_tribbiani Good night!
joey_tribbiani Get back in there!
phoebe_buffay Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about that whole thing with Roger. It really wasn't right, and I, and I want to make it up to you, so umm, I brought you something that I think you'll really enjoy. Now, this is just a loan. Okay? I'm gonna, I'm gonna want him back. So... I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry, I thought I could do it and I can't!
