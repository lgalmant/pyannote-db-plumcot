chandler_bing This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now.
joey_tribbiani There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
chandler_bing It's Phoebe! Hi!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 Hi. Okay, will that be all?
chandler_bing Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, "Excuse me, hello Miss," so now I'm here.
joey_tribbiani No, no... how come you are working here?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 Right, yeah, 'cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute.
chandler_bing Can we start over?
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 Yeah. Okay great. I'm gonna be over here.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani No, no, no!
dr_ross_geller I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, "supposedly" by accident.
rachel_green No, yeah, I've done that.
dr_ross_geller And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
rachel_green I've never done that.
chandler_bing All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister.
joey_tribbiani I'm sayin' I see a difference.
chandler_bing They're twins!
joey_tribbiani I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's... hot!
chandler_bing You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.

joey_tribbiani Not from where I was standin'.
phoebe_buffay where were you standing?

phoebe_buffay It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like "yeah, right, well what else is new?"
dr_ross_geller Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class.
chandler_bing Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
rachel_green So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
dr_ross_geller No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
rachel_green Well, isn't, isn't that gonna be weird?
dr_ross_geller No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation.

carol_willick It's a little complicated.
dr_ross_geller A little.
susan_bunch But we're fine.

nina_bookbinder Hi.
chandler_bing Hi, Nina. Come on in.
nina_bookbinder You wanted to see me?
chandler_bing Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers.
nina_bookbinder Which is bad, because?
chandler_bing Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
nina_bookbinder Your... excuse me?
chandler_bing WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net...
nina_bookbinder Oh, Net Usage Statistics, right. Gotcha, gotcha. Won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your... "wenus."
chandler_bing It's not just that she's cute, okay. It's just that... she's really really cute.
dr_ross_geller It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
monica_geller Ross, your little creature's got the remote again.
dr_ross_geller Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
monica_geller Great.
dr_ross_geller Relax, I'll fix it.
rachel_green Cool... "Urkel" in Spanish is "Urkel."
dr_ross_geller How did he do this?
chandler_bing So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
monica_geller Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's... but obviously someone forgot.
rachel_green Well, someone was supposed to write "Rach, take down the lights" and put it on the re... frigerate... How long has that been there?
chandler_bing Hey, where you been?
joey_tribbiani I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
chandler_bing Score.
joey_tribbiani She is so hot!
chandler_bing Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err...
joey_tribbiani Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
joey_tribbiani You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
phoebe_buffay Why? Why would you wanna... do that? Why?
joey_tribbiani So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there.
phoebe_buffay Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, we've grown apart, so, um... I don't know, why not? Okay.
joey_tribbiani Cool, thanks.
dr_ross_geller You okay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah I'm fine.
dr_ross_geller You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
dr_ross_geller Sorry.
dr_ross_geller Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's, where's Carol?
susan_bunch Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
dr_ross_geller No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know what's going on.
susan_bunch Oh, good. This'll be fun.
the_lamaze_teacher Alrighty. We're gonna start with some basic third stage breathing exercises, so Mummies, why don't you get on your back? And... coaches, you should be supporting Mummy's head.
dr_ross_geller@susan_bunch What? What? What?
susan_bunch I am supposed to be the mommy?
dr_ross_geller Okay, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time.
susan_bunch Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman.
dr_ross_geller I see. So what do you propose to do?
susan_bunch I will flip you for it.
dr_ross_geller Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
susan_bunch On your back... Mom.
the_lamaze_teacher Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath.
the_lamaze_teacher Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower.
chandler_bing Mr. D, how's it going, sir?
mr_douglas Ohh, it's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
chandler_bing And?
mr_douglas It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
chandler_bing So what does this mean?
mr_douglas Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department.
chandler_bing Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
mr_douglas Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
chandler_bing Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
nina_bookbinder Are you okay?
chandler_bing Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please don't hate me.
nina_bookbinder What?
chandler_bing Would you like to have dinner sometime?
rachel_green So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
phoebe_buffay Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
rachel_green Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
phoebe_buffay Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
rachel_green Ooh, okay... good.
jamie_buchman What is this place?
fran_devanow Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and...there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?
jamie_buchman I think we have an answer.
fran_devanow What's she doing here?
jamie_buchman This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
fran_devanow Think she got fired at Riff's?
jamie_buchman No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept...bringing swordfish. are you gonna go to the, um?
fran_devanow I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right.
jamie_buchman It looks like her.
jamie_buchman Um, excuse me.
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
jamie_buchman Hi, it's us.
phoebe_buffay Right, and it's me.
jamie_buchman So, so you're here too?
phoebe_buffay Much as you are.
jamie_buchman Your turn.
fran_devanow Err... we know what we want.
phoebe_buffay Oh, that's good.
jamie_buchman All we want is two Caffe Lattes.
fran_devanow And some biscottie cookies.
phoebe_buffay Good choice.
jamie_buchman Definitely her.
fran_devanow Yeah.
monica_geller I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
chandler_bing Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights.
monica_geller Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument.
chandler_bing I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?
rachel_green Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. "Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work?"
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing@rachel_green Hey.
chandler_bing You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock any more.
monica_geller I'll get it.
monica_geller Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
mr_heckles You're doing it again.
monica_geller We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly.
mr_heckles I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep.
rachel_green You don't even have cats.
mr_heckles I could have cats.
monica_geller Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
rachel_green We'll try to keep it down.
joey_tribbiani Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, my first birthday present...oh, this is really...
joey_tribbiani Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh... Sure, yeah...okay, it fits.
rachel_green Are you seein' her again tonight?
joey_tribbiani Yep. Ice Capades.
chandler_bing Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
joey_tribbiani I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin' about her.
phoebe_buffay That you like, we get it. You like her. Great!
joey_tribbiani Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
phoebe_buffay Alright, well, maybe now it's not okay.
joey_tribbiani Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
chandler_bing Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
chandler_bing And that's the Chrysler Building right there.
mr_douglas Nina.
nina_bookbinder Mr.Douglas...cool tie.
mr_douglas She's still here.
chandler_bing Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
chandler_bing And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
mr_douglas You're kidding? She seems so...
chandler_bing Oh, no, no. Nina...she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
mr_douglas That's unbelievable.
chandler_bing And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
mr_douglas I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head.
chandler_bing Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.
soothing_male_voice#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 .a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth.
the_lamaze_teacher Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our final class.
dr_ross_geller Susan, go deep.
carol_willick This is impossible. It's just impossible.
susan_bunch What is, honey?
carol_willick What that woman... did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in, that's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in.
dr_ross_geller Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everything's gonna be alright.
carol_willick Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, "Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"
susan_bunch Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath.
susan_bunch I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives.
susan_bunch I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna be a father.
rachel_green This is just occurring to you?
dr_ross_geller I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
rachel_green Oh, you're gonna be great!
dr_ross_geller Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
chandler_bing You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
phoebe_buffay Where're you going?
joey_tribbiani Out.
phoebe_buffay With?
joey_tribbiani Yes.
phoebe_buffay Alright, could I just ask you one question?
phoebe_buffay Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
joey_tribbiani Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, okay?
joey_tribbiani You meant sex, right?
nina_bookbinder Do you have a sec?
chandler_bing Ah, sure, Nina. What's up?
nina_bookbinder I don't know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks.
chandler_bing Oh, well, ah... maybe that's because they're ah... jealous, of us.
nina_bookbinder Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
chandler_bing Ah, well, maybe that's, ah, because you're getting a big raise.
nina_bookbinder I am?
chandler_bing Sure, why not?
nina_bookbinder Oh my god! You're amazing!
chandler_bing Oh, you don't know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?
helen#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel?
nina_bookbinder What?
chandler_bing Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
chandler_bing Well, I ended up telling her everything.
rachel_green Oh, how'd she take it?
chandler_bing Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: if you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand...on the desk.
monica_geller Okay, I think I get how to do this.
phoebe_buffay Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I can't, I can't watch.
monica_geller okay, Pheebs, they're gone.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Are you alright?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing, it's...
rachel_green Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
phoebe_buffay Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
monica_geller@rachel_green No.
phoebe_buffay Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldn't even talk to me any more. Because he said he didn't wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
rachel_green Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
chandler_bing You're not gonna lose him.
monica_geller Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. Okay.
dr_ross_geller No, come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
phoebe_buffay But he's falling in love with her.
rachel_green Oh please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious.
phoebe_buffay Okay... Okay.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, oh.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 Oh.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode16 Yeah, um, may we help you?
monica_geller Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
rachel_green No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so...I'm takin' 'em down. Okay? Whoa!
monica_geller Oh-my-god Rachel! Rachel!
rachel_green I'm okay! I'm okay! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
mr_heckles See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about.
