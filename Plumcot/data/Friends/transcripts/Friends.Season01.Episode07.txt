rachel_green Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe_buffay Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much.
chandler_bing Oh, great. This is just...
rachel_green Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
monica_geller Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
rachel_green Wow, you guys, this is big.
monica_geller Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK.
phoebe_buffay Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number?
phoebe_buffay Well, I never call me.
chandler_bing Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
jill_goodacre Hi Mom, it's Jill.
chandler_bing She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
jill_goodacre Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.
chandler_bing Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
jill_goodacre I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.
chandler_bing Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
joey_tribbiani Hi everyone.
dr_ross_geller And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
joey_tribbiani Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
phoebe_buffay Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
rachel_green That had to hurt!
chandler_bing Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
chandler_bing There you go!
chandler_bing You're definitely scaring here.
jill_goodacre Would you like to call somebody?
chandler_bing Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks.
monica_geller Hello?
chandler_bing Hey, it's me.
monica_geller It's Chandler! Are you OK?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
monica_geller I have no idea what you just said.
chandler_bing Put Joey on the phone.
joey_tribbiani What's up man?
chandler_bing I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen.
chandler_bing Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
rachel_green Alright, somebody.
monica_geller OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
all@ Whoooaa!
dr_ross_geller That's my sister.
joey_tribbiani OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
monica_geller Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, what about you?
phoebe_buffay Oh... Milwaukee.
rachel_green Um... Ross?
dr_ross_geller Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
all@ No way!
dr_ross_geller The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
phoebe_buffay Oh, Rachel.
rachel_green Oh come on, I already went.
monica_geller You did not go!
all@ Come on.
rachel_green Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be..... oh, the foot of the bed.
dr_ross_geller Step back.
joey_tribbiani We have a winner!
rachel_green I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
dr_ross_geller Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
rachel_green There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
dr_ross_geller Come on.
rachel_green No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
dr_ross_geller And you didn't marry him because...?
rachel_green I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
dr_ross_geller Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
rachel_green Yeah right.
dr_ross_geller It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
rachel_green OK.
dr_ross_geller But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
rachel_green You don't.
dr_ross_geller Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller Mmmm.
rachel_green You do?
dr_ross_geller I do.
rachel_green Oh Ross, you're so great.
joey_tribbiani It's never gonna happen.
dr_ross_geller What?
joey_tribbiani You and Rachel.
dr_ross_geller What? Why not?
joey_tribbiani Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
joey_tribbiani Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
dr_ross_geller I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
joey_tribbiani Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
dr_ross_geller I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now?
joey_tribbiani Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...'
dr_ross_geller Shhhh!
rachel_green What are you shushing?
dr_ross_geller We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Don't you hear that?
rachel_green Ahhhh!
dr_ross_geller See?
rachel_green Huh.
jill_goodacre Would you like some gum?
chandler_bing Um, is it sugarless?
jill_goodacre Sorry, it's not.
chandler_bing Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
phoebe_buffay New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la...
dr_ross_geller OK, here goes.
joey_tribbiani Are you going to do it?
dr_ross_geller I'm going to do it.
joey_tribbiani Do you want any help?
dr_ross_geller You come out there, you're a dead man.
joey_tribbiani Good luck, man.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. OK.
joey_tribbiani OK.
joey_tribbiani Hey, where are you going?
monica_geller Outside.
joey_tribbiani You can't go out there.
monica_geller Why not?
joey_tribbiani Because of... the reason.
monica_geller And that would be?
joey_tribbiani I, um, can't tell you.
monica_geller Joey, what's going on?
joey_tribbiani OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
monica_geller About what?
joey_tribbiani He's planning your birthday party.
monica_geller Oh my God! I love him!
joey_tribbiani You'd better act surprised.
phoebe_buffay About what?
monica_geller My surprise party!
phoebe_buffay What surprise party?
monica_geller Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
phoebe_buffay Well, he didn't tell me.
joey_tribbiani Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
phoebe_buffay This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
monica_geller No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
phoebe_buffay Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. Looks like I was second to last.
rachel_green Hmmm... this is so nice.
dr_ross_geller OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
rachel_green OK.
dr_ross_geller OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
rachel_green Ohhh!!!!
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes, that's right...
rachel_green Oh, look at the little cat!
dr_ross_geller What? Ow!
joey_tribbiani@monica_geller@phoebe_buffay I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since...
monica_geller This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
joey_tribbiani Sorry, that was wax.
phoebe_buffay Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
dr_ross_geller Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
rachel_green During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
chandler_bing You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
rachel_green Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
mr_heckles Er, yeah, it's mine.
phoebe_buffay He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
mr_heckles Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.
phoebe_buffay Wait a minute. What's his name?
mr_heckles Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
rachel_green Bob Buttons?
mr_heckles Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.
phoebe_buffay Oooh! You are a very bad man!
mr_heckles You owe me a cat.
rachel_green Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
rachel_green Wow.
dr_ross_geller Lucky sixes....
rachel_green Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
monica_geller Hi!
rachel_green And Joey....
monica_geller Hi!
rachel_green And Ross.
monica_geller Hi!
rachel_green He doesn't speak much English.
paolo Monopoly!
rachel_green Look at that!
dr_ross_geller So, um... where did Paolo come from?
rachel_green Oh... Italy, I think.
dr_ross_geller No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
rachel_green Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
dr_ross_geller That, that is funny...... and Rachel keeps touching him.
phoebe_buffay Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
rachel_green Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
phoebe_buffay Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
rachel_green Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay You betcha!
chandler_bing Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
chandler_bing Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth.
chandler_bing Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
jill_goodacre Are you alright?
jill_goodacre My God, you're choking! That better?
chandler_bing Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
jill_goodacre Perfection?
dr_ross_geller Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
dr_ross_geller Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
rachel_green I have absolutely no idea.
dr_ross_geller That's... that's classic.
rachel_green Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
monica_geller If you want, I'll do it.
phoebe_buffay I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I won't.
rachel_green God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
phoebe_buffay You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard..... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
rachel_green Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
dr_ross_geller Paolo. Hi.
paolo Ross!
dr_ross_geller Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
paolo Thing?
dr_ross_geller Thing, yes. Thing.
paolo Ah, you... have the sex?
dr_ross_geller No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
paolo Bed?
dr_ross_geller No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
paolo Oh!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Se vice?
paolo Si.
dr_ross_geller So you do know a little English.
paolo Poco... a leetle.
dr_ross_geller Do you know the word crapweasel?
paolo No.
dr_ross_geller That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
jill_goodacre Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.
chandler_bing OK.
jill_goodacre Ready?
jill_goodacre No, you've got to whip it.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7..... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48....
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Thanks.
dr_ross_geller Kinda... spooky without any lights.
joey_tribbiani Bwah-hah-hah!
dr_ross_geller OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
dr_ross_geller Oh.. oh... oh.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
jill_goodacre Well, this has been fun.
chandler_bing Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
jill_goodacre Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya.
chandler_bing Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
