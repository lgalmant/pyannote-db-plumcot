monica What's so funny?
joey Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
monica Oh.
joey What-what's so funny?
gunther Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
chandler Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
gunther Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
chandler Okay.
gunther Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
chandler No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
chandler Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
rachel Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
chandler Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
rachel Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
ross Pffhah.
rachel What's your problem?
ross Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
rachel Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
ross Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
rachel Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
phoebe All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
chandler Or what my Father called Thursday night.
ross Here you go.
rachel Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
ross Sorry.
frank Hi!
phoebe Oh my God!!
frank Hi!
phoebe Frank! Hi!
frank How are you?
phoebe What are you doing here?
frank Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
phoebe What happened?
frank Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
phoebe But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
frank Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
phoebe Your getting married?!
frank Oh, yeah!
all Wow!
phoebe My little brother's getting married!!
frank Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
phoebe Do I?
frank Do you?
phoebe Yeah, I do, yeah.
frank Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiancï¿½e man!
chandler Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
phoebe Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
monica Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
phoebe What, he's 18.
ross Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
joey Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
chandler Always illegal Joe.
frank Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancï¿½e, Mrs. Knight.
alice Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
phoebe Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
monica So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
frank Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
alice And he was my best student.
frank Yeah, she was my best teacher.
alice Ohhh.
chandler If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
ross And so now you guys are gonna be married?
alice Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
rachel Oh my God!! Great!
phoebe Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
frank I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
alice Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
phoebe Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
alice Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
hypnosis_tape You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
monica And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
rachel Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
monica Pete, can I get you something else?
pete Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
monica Haven't you and I covered that topic?
pete Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you... .
monica Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
pete Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
rachel Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
monica I mean really, think about it.
pete Ho-ho, I will.
phoebe No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
ross Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
phoebe No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
joey Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
phoebe But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
joey Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
phoebe Yes. Not out loud.
ross Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
phoebe Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
ross_and_joey No-no-no-no-no.
phoebe Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
ross_and_joey No.
phoebe Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
joey So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, “Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes,” remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, “Nah, let's just hang out at your place.” Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
rachel I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
monica Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
rachel Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker
monica Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids... . All right, I get your point.
rachel All right.
chandler Hi.
monica Hey.
chandler Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
monica Uh, yeah.
rachel Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
chandler Y'know what, pretty good.
rachel Yeah?
chandler Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.
rachel Thank you.
monica Here you go.
chandler Thanks
rachel Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
chandler What check thing?
monica As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
chandler Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
monica That's Bill Clinton.
chandler Who's he huggin'?
monica Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
chandler This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
rachel We use it!!
chandler There you go!!
rachel Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
monica I'm not gonna go out with him.
rachel Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
monica Or incredibly offensive.
rachel Oh yeah, sure, that too.
chandler What?
ross All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
joey Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
frank What, you don't think I know that?
joey Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
ross Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
frank Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
joey Yeah, in a poem maybe.
ross No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
frank You don't have it anymore?
ross No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
frank Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
ross It didn't.
frank Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
joey Now, wh-what, what is that like?
frank It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
ross Yeah, yeah.
joey Why can't I find that?
ross Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
joey Well, I want it!
frank You can have it!
joey I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
ross Oh, no! No!
frank It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
joey Then you hold on to it!!
frank All right, man!!
joey All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
phoebe You're Frank's best man?!
joey I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
phoebe Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
ross I'm the ring bearer.
phoebe Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
alice Oh my God, who died on this?!
phoebe Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
alice Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to
phoebe Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
alice Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
phoebe Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
pete Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
all Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
secretary You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
pete Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
monica What the hell is this?
pete Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
monica Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
pete Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
monica You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
employee Umm, I'm still here.
pete You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
monica What?!
pete Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
monica Okay, umm, you're a loon.
pete Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
monica I don't know.
pete Why not?
monica 'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
pete One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
frank Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
phoebe Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
frank Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
phoebe Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
frank Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
phoebe What umm, what happened?
frank Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
phoebe Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
frank Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
phoebe Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
frank Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
phoebe Oh, sweetie, oh.
frank Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
phoebe Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
frank What?
phoebe Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
frank Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
phoebe Okay.
frank Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
phoebe Okay, but.
frank Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go
rachel Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
chandler Oh my God!
monica Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
chandler Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
monica I know!!
chandler Okay, then get the lobster!
monica Hey!
pete Hi.
rachel Hi!!

monica Why, how much is that?
pete That's about 60 cents.
joey Every night!!

alice Hi Frank.
frank Hi, Mrs. Knight.
alice Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
phoebe Yeah, but not just that.
alice Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
phoebe None the less.
alice None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
phoebe That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good. .
