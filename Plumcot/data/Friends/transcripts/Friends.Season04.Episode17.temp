mr_treeger Ohhh, man!!
joey What is that?
chandler Treeger's snaking the shower drain.
mr_treeger What in the name of hell?
joey Maybe he found you flip-flop.
chandler Hey!
joey Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I must've hit something on the remote.
chandler Do we pay for this?
joey No, we didn't even pay our cable bill-maybe this is how they punish us.
chandler Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill-free phone sex.
joey Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill?
mr_treeger Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.
chandler Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!
mr_treeger Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.
chandler Like finding money with naked people on it!
mr_treeger Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And I'm sad.
joey Why would he turn off the TV?
rachel All right, y'know what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat?
joey_and_chandler Oh no-no-no-no!
chandler We don't know what could make this go away.
joey Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!
chandler And no one touches the air around the TV!
joey Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?
monica Well at least, I'm going to mute it.
joey_and_chandler Oh no-no-no!
chandler We still have porn.
joey Hey.
phoebe Hi!
monica Hi!
rachel Honey, what are you doing? That's too heavy.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel Give it here. Oh, God.
monica Okay.
phoebe Ohh, I'm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Y'know, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table.
chandler Or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
phoebe You mean like a doctor?
joey Pheebs! You're blocking the porn! Look out!
phoebe Ohh! Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.
ross Hi.
monica Hi.
ross So uh, Emily just went to the airport.
monica Oh. Why didn't you take her?
ross Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And y'know, we-we said our good-byes this morning, so
monica You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!
ross Nah.
monica Hey, cheer up! You're gonna see her again, right?
ross Well I, that's the thing, I don't know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Let's just enjoy..."
monica No-no-no, don't-don't do the accent. You've got to see her again.
ross And why do you care so much?
monica Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!
ross You had fantasies about Emily?
monica No! Y'know, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
ross Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?
monica Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!
ross Ahh.
monica Do you love her?
ross We said it was only going to be two weeks, y'know?
monica You love her!
ross What-what is love really?
monica Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. You're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate. You're gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And she's gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
ross I am a good kisser.
monica Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes in... I've been watching too much porn.
rachel Is that the heartbeat?
the_doctor That's it.
phoebe Oh my God!
rachel Oh wow! This is so cool.
the_doctor Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?
phoebe Why don't take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, I'll hold onto your card, okay?
the_doctor No, I'm getting three separate heartbeats.
phoebe Three? You guys were worried I wouldn't even have one!
the_doctor Doctors are wrong all the time.
phoebe Well, yeah.
rachel Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!
the_doctor Definitely.
phoebe Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months I'm going to have three full grown babies just walkin' around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
the_doctor Actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
phoebe What do you know?!
alice Oh-oh, Phoebe!
phoebe Ooh! Hi!
alice Hi! So, how did it go at the doctors?
phoebe Oh well, okay, hey, y'know how when you're umm, you're walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, that's nice?"
frank Yes.
phoebe Okay, yeah well, good news, you're going to have three babies.
alice Three babies?
frank I finally got my band!
alice We're gonna have a big family, I've always wanted a big family!
phoebe Oh God, I'm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
frank Why would we be freaked?
phoebe No, no maybe 'cause it's harder to raise them, and the added expense, and
frank Oh.
alice Right.
phoebe No, back to happy. Back to happy!
alice No-no-no, no, it's going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Y'know it'll-it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.
frank Yeah, I've been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.
alice No, Frank.
phoebe No you can't quit college! No! You're in college? Really?
frank Yeah, refrigerator college.
alice Yeah.
frank Yeah, y'know when we found out we were going to have a baby, y'know I figured y'know like I should y'know have like a career-and I love refrigerators!
phoebe You can't give up on your dream.
frank No, it's okay. We're-we're gonna have three kids! And that's-that's a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.
ticket_agent This is the boarding call for Flight 009.
ross Emily!
emily Oh my God! What are you doing here?
ross I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.
emily You are so sweet.
ross That's, that's, that's a big candy bar. I had the most amazing time with you.
emily Me too.
ticket_agent This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.
emily Well, that' me. Here, have this. I'm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway.
ross Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, I've been thinking, I'm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.
emily Oh. Thank you.
ross That's no problem.
rachel What's that song? It has been in my head all day long.
chandler It's the theme from Good Will Humping.
rachel Y'know who doesn't even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.
joey Yeah right.
rachel No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.
chandler Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?
rachel Yes!
joey Yeah, he likes porn.
monica Where ya going?
rachel I'm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. Hey, Pheebs!
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey!
monica How did it go with Frank and Alice?
phoebe Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
chandler They don't really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.
monica Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?
ross I did.
monica And well, what did she say?
ross Thank you.
monica Oh, you're totally welcome! What'd she say?
ross She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."
chandler Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?
joey Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!
ross What do I do now?
joey You play hard to get.
ross She already lives in London.
joey Then you go to Tokyo.
chandler All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, it's over.
monica It is not over! You're over!
chandler What?
monica You know!
chandler Okay. Good one.
monica It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go!
ross Okay! Okay! But if she doesn't call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, y'know just to she what's going on, and, and she says she'll call me back, but then she doesn't. Then it's over.
joey Way to be strong, man!
rachel Hey!
chandler Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.
rachel Well, so, why don't you just turn it off?
chandler Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.
phoebe Ooh, good, you're hear! Okay.
monica Hey!
phoebe Hi!
rachel Well, what-what 'cha got there?
phoebe Oh this, well I'm glad you asked. Now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? Ahh! Now, I know what you're thinking
chandler Pregnant Woman Slays Four?
monica Phoebe, they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?
phoebe No!
monica Are you sure?
phoebe No!
rachel Honey, you're not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.
phoebe No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.
chandler What's the second part of your plan?
phoebe My Saturn dealership.
ross Hello?
emily Ross.
ross Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?
emily It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.
ross No, no, that-that, that's all right. Umm, I'm just glad you called.
emily Ross umm, there's something that I've got to tell you, there's-there's someone else.
ross Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?
ross She doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.
monica This isn't how it's supposed to go, there can't be another guy.
ross Well
monica Of course there's another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!
ross I'm not proving anything. Okay, I'm done listening to you. If I hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never would've put my fist through the wall!
chandler You put your fist through the wall?
ross No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!
monica You have to go to London!
ross What?
monica Yeah, you have to go fight for her!
joey Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. 'Cause you already told her you love her and she didn't say it back, then she called you and told you that there's another guy, so yeah, go to London that'll scare her!
monica When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?
ross I made fun of his accent.
monica You sat back and let him have her, you didn't fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?
ross No.
monica All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!
ross Really?
monica Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Don't let her go without a fight!
ross All right. All right, I'm gonna do it!
monica All right.
ross I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to London and I'm going to fight for her.
monica Okay, good luck!
joey Ross! Ross! If you're going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars?
rachel Hey!
phoebe Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! I'm gonna open up my own massage place and Frank's gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesn't have to quit school!
monica That's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
rachel Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised
phoebe I'm telling it! I'm telling it!
rachel Okay.
phoebe Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what I've got?
chandler A place where no one will ever get out alive?
phoebe No! Think about it, it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax, it's
rachel Relaxi-Taxi!
phoebe The name was my favourite part!
rachel Well, well I can up with it!
phoebe YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! That's not good.
rachel Well, I
monica Hello.
ross Hey.
monica Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?
ross No, because she hasn't come home yet. And she hasn't been home all night! She's obviously staying with that other guy, and I'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!
monica All right. When is, when is the next flight out?
ross About four hours.
monica Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
phoebe Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than Relaxi Cab.
rachel Okay, it's not Relaxi Cab. It's Relaxicab, like taxicab.
phoebe Oh, that is better.
chandler Are we in London?
monica What are you doing here? You can't be here!
emily I've uh, I've come to talk to Ross.
emily What?
joey Nothing. No, nothing.
emily I was going to call him, but
monica Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! I was right! I'm right, right?
emily I'd really rather talk to him.
monica Oh.
emily I uh, I've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
emily Ross, are you there? Ross, I don't know if you can hear this but... I'm gonna talk anyway, uh, I'm in the States with you sister and your friends and it's all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell you-Yes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.
ross I love you too! I'm, I'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! You can't hear me.
emily I wish I could know if you'd heard any of that. I suppose I've either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose there's not much chance you did heard that, and there's the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. Hello.
ross Hi.
emily Ross, I love you!
ross Ohh! Thank you.
chandler Hey.
joey Hey.
chandler I was just at the bank, and there was this really hot teller, and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.
joey Same kind of thing happened to me! Woman pizza delivery guy come over, gives me the pizza, takes the money, and leaves!
chandler What, no, "Nice apartment, I bet the bedrooms are huge?"
joey Noo! Nothing!
chandler Y'know what, we have to turn off the porn.
joey I think you're right.
chandler All right, ready?
joey One.
chandler Two.
both Three.
joey That's kinda nice.
chandler Yeah, that's kinda a relief.
joey Yeah.
chandler You wanna see if we still have it?
