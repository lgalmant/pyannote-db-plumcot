phoebe Hi, you guys.
chandler Hey!
monica Hi!
rachel What's the matter?
phoebe Well it's just-it's one of those situations that I just hate. Y'know? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.
joey Now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.
phoebe No! No! It's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!
chandler I'll give up my ticket.
joey Me too.
phoebe Okay that's so generous!
chandler And I think Ross is generous too.
phoebe Great! Okay then it's just us girls!
monica_and_rachel Great.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel So what-what is the exhibit.
phoebe It's mostly just photographs of lesbian love scenes interspersed with video games and free sandwiches.
joey Oh man!
ross Hey!
rachel Hi!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey Ross listen Chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend!
ross Thanks? But I have plans; Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
monica Oh that's great!
ross Yeah.
monica I mean think about all the money that you're gonna make!
ross Why? What?
monica Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?
ross No, no, that's funny. But maybe it's time to move on, let it go, y'know? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabeth's father, so ah, he's much older than she is. Looks like I'm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?
rachel I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.
ross Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings in his ear.
chandler Ross.
ross Oh, come on you guys; that's funny! Y'know? Because he's need-he's got like a hearing aide y'know, 'cause-'cause y'know, 'cause he's all old, and
paul Okay look, Ross, just so you know that since Lizzie likes you so much, I've decided to accept the fact that you're going out with her.
ross Really? That okay, that's great.
paul Yeah. But then I changed my mind. I'm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now I'm telling you, I don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.
ross All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.
paul Yes it does.
ross But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I don't think there's really anything you can do about it.
paul I'll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.
ross Ohh! A man with a plan!
phoebe Oh, this is so exciting! You get your picture back up on the wall of fame! Eek!
joey I know. It was so cool when I was up there before. Me and Jim Belushi would just be crackin' up about something... Then I get fired off of Days Of Our Lives and he takes me down. Now he's just laughing at me. Look at him, that smug Belushi bastard, I'll
phoebe Ohh, okay maybe they put your picture back up they can put you next to Matt Lauer. Look at him, smiling at me. Yeah I know; we'd be great together!
joey Hey! So I'm back.
the_dry_cleaner Who are you?
joey Joey Tribbiani! From the wall! Okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh? Huh? Okay eh-ah-anyway, I'm ready to go back up on the wall I'm the star of a new TV show.
the_dry_cleaner Show me in the table.
joey Oh well, it's not on TV yet.
the_dry_cleaner Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
joey Okay, fine, I will bring you a tape, huh?
phoebe So umm, now do you have any of Matt Lauer's clothes here? Maybe? Just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?
monica Oh, I love museums!
rachel Umm.
monica Soakin' up all the culture.
rachel Yeah.
monica Where do you want to start?
rachel Ooh, the gift shop!
monica Yeah!
phoebe Hey, and then lunch.
rachel Oh, wait yes, but I can't eat too much. Paul is taking me out to dinner tonight, he said he has a big surprise planned.
phoebe Oh wow. What, do you think maybe he's gonna tell you that he's gay?
rachel What?! No! Why?!
phoebe No reason! That would just be a really big surprise, right?
the_museum_official You can put the aisle over here , and put the wedding ceremony right over here.
rachel I didn't know you could get married here.
monica This would be a beautiful place to get married, yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there and I would never have the ceremony there! I mean you'd have the ceremony under this big beautiful arch.
the_museum_official May I help you?
rachel Oh sorry didn't mean to interrupt. It's just such a beautiful space; do you do a lot of weddings here?
the_museum_official Yes. We're very popular. There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry!
rachel Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list
monica What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.
phoebe Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.
rachel Yeah hon, it can't hurt to put your name down! I mean in if two years if you're not engaged you just don't use it.
monica Well, I mean I guess there is no harm in putting my name down.
rachel I'm gonna do it too!
phoebe Me too!
rachel Really? Who would, who would you marry?
phoebe I don't know, I don't have anyone right now. Y'know?
rachel Oh Pheebs.
phoebe Don't feel too sorry for me. At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
monica Phoebe, that stuff is
phoebe Don't even get me started on yours!
joey Hey! So, did you watch the tape of my show?
the_dry_cleaner I did.
joey All right, let's get me back up there!
the_dry_cleaner No! It don't go up on the wall!
joey What-But you saw the show!
the_dry_cleaner Yes, it was very offensive to my people!
joey Dry cleaners?
the_dry_cleaner Russians! It showed them as terrorists and villains!
joey Okay! Okay, look! You-you-you got Harrison Ford up there!
the_dry_cleaner That's right. Mr. Ford is a very good customer, he brings us a lot of clothes; you bring us nothing!
joey Okay well that may be true. But, in-in okay, Air Force One the Russians were terrorists! And evil! And plus he kills a bunch of them! That-that-that's offensive to Russians.
the_dry_cleaner I've never seen it!
joey Oh you should, it's great.
ross This place is really beautiful!
elizabeth Yeah, I've been coming here since I was a kid. This used to be my Grandma's.
ross Wow! The only thing I got from my Grandmother was her eyes. I mean not-not her actual eyeballs, but, but people say that my eyes-Do-do you want to make out?
elizabeth Sure!
elizabeth Are you okay? What's wrong?
ross Ehh, I was just, I was just thinking about your father.
elizabeth Well, whatever works for ya
ross No. No-no uh, he just, he just really freaked me out before.
elizabeth Oh. Well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person. Big deal. Besides, it's kinda fun hiding.
ross Yeah.
elizabeth Hey umm, you brought protection right?
ross Why?! Are there like bears or something?! Ohh. Oh, protection. Yeah-no, yeah-no, that-that-that I forgot.
elizabeth I'll just run to the store and get some.
ross Oh no! Hey-hey, I'm the guy! I'll get it.
elizabeth Do you know where the store is?
ross No.
elizabeth Do you want to ride around town on my little pink bicycle?
ross A little bit.
elizabeth I'll be back in ten minutes.
ross Okay.
elizabeth Why don't you get in the hot tub and I'll meet you there.
ross Ohh, okay.

paul Ross. You and I are going to have to have a little talk.
elizabeth Daddy!
paul You're next!!
elizabeth Okay. I didn't know he was here.
paul Let me just see if I got this straight. I tell you to stay away from my daughter or I'll have you fired. What you heard was, "Take my daughter, come up to my country house, and ruin my weekend with Rachel!"
ross Okay, please-please Paul, just let me explain
paul No, let me explain! Fired!!
ross All right, fine! Fine! Have me fired! But uh, I want you to know that you and I are not all that different. I mean, I too am a neat guy.
paul What?
ross And I too am just a love machine.
paul Ross, let me show you where the guest room is.
monica I'm so sorry. Please, stop freaking out.
chandler I'm not freaking out. Why would I be freaking out? A woman named Heldi called and said we were getting married, but that happens everyday.
monica Honey, we were at this beautiful place, and I-I-I just put our names down for fun! I mean, what's the harm in that?
chandler Right here!
monica Chandler, please don't think I was trying to pressure you. Phoebe and Rachel
chandler Phoebe and Rachel! So the people that knew about our wedding before me were you, Phoebe and Rachel, Heldi, and apparently some band called Starlight Magic 7 who are available by the way!
monica It was a mistake. Please don't take this to mean anything, because it doesn't.
chandler Okay.
monica Really?
chandler Yes, if it really doesn't mean anything, because you know that I'm just not ready
monica I know! I know.
chandler Okay.
monica I'm gonna go tell Joey that that you're back. I was really worried about you.
phoebe Hey, did she buy it?
chandler Totally.
phoebe So did Heldi show you the place?
chandler Yeah, it's beautiful.
phoebe I can't believe you're gonna ask Monica to marry you!
chandler I know.
joey Hey Gunther.
gunther Hey! Take these cappuccinos to table 11 and that guy over there wants the biscotti.
joey Oh uh, well I just came in for a cup of coffee to go.
gunther Do you still work here?
joey No! No, I quit a long time ago. Did I forget to you that one? I'm sorry.
gunther Oh that's cool, I was gonna fire you anyway.
joey Great!
