rachel Hi!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel So what's the final head count on my baby shower?
phoebe About twenty, a couple people from work who had something else to do.
monica Also both of your sisters called and neither can make it.
rachel What?! You mean they're not coming to a social event where there's no men and there's no booze?! That's shocking! I don't care, as long as my mom's here.
monica Oh my God, your mother!
rachel What?! My mom's not gonna be here?!
monica Well, given that we forgot to invite her it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.
rachel My God!
monica Well it wasn't my fault, Phoebe was in charge of the invitations!
phoebe Well I don't, I don't have a mother so often I forget that other people
monica Oh give it a rest!
rachel So my mother is not coming to my baby shower?!
phoebe No. Neither is mine.
monica Okay, y'know what? Don't worry, okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her. Just go home and get ready.
rachel Please, make sure she comes. It's really important to me, I mean it's my mom!
phoebe I know. I know, what's her number?
rachel I don't know.
monica Go! I have it in my book. Go! Wait a minute! If you're in charge of the invitations why am I the one who has to call her-Hello Mrs. Green! Hi, it's Monica Geller.
mrs_green Oh, hello Monica.
monica Hi, umm I know this is last minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu baby shower for Rachel today.
mrs_green I know, my daughter's told me about it when they received their impromptu invitations a month ago.
monica Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm-I'm so sorry.
mrs_green For what dear? For not inviting me or lying about it?
monica Oh my God, my ass is sweating! Please! Please! Can you come? It's today at four.
mrs_green Well all right. I'll see you at four.
monica Thank you.
phoebe Isn't it at three?
monica Son of a bitch!
chandler Hey Joe! You wanna shoot some hoops?
joey Oh no, I can't go. I'm practicing; I got an audition to be the host of a new game show.
ross Oh cool!
chandler That's great.
joey Yeah-yeah, and if I get it by day I'll Dr. Drake Remoray, but by night I'll be Joey Trrrribbiani!
chandler You'll be perfect for this! That's already your name!
joey But the audition's in a couple hours and I don't even understand the game.
ross Well do you want some help?
joey Oh really? That'd be great! You guys can be the contestants!
ross Awesome!
chandler Okay, I guess we can lose to junior high girls some other time.
joey All right! Let's play Bamboozled!
chandler Bamboozled?
joey Yeah, isn't that a cool name?
ross Yeah!
chandler No!
joey All right. Uhh, okay. Our first contestant is Ross Geller. Why don't you tell us a little something about you Ross?
ross Well uh, I-I'm a paleontologist. Umm, I-I live in New York. I have a son Ben. Uh, hi Ben! And uh
joey I said a little bit Ross. Now, how about you Chandler?
chandler Well Joey, I'm a headhunter. I hook up out of work Soviet scientists with rogue third-world nations. Hi Rasputin!
joey Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?
chandler Bogota.
joey It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card.
chandler What does a Wicked Wango card do?
joey I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.
chandler Higher or lower than what?
joey This is embarrassing.
chandler Can you believe how lame this is?
ross I'm sorry, I don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.
phoebe Oh, I told the stripper to be here at five. That's good right?
monica You ordered a stripper for the shower?! That is totally inappropriate!
phoebe What? He's gonna be dressed as a baby! Oh hi Mrs. Green!
monica Hi!
phoebe I'm so glad you could make it.
monica Yes, thank you so much. And again, we're so sorry. We could not feel worse about it.
mrs_green Try. There's my little girl.
monica She's still mad.
phoebe Yeah I know. Isn't it great? One less person we have to make small talk with.
monica Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too. It-it doesn't bother you?
phoebe No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it.
monica Okay. I can do that. I gotta go powder my ass.
mrs_green Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea.
rachel Okay.
mrs_green Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper 'cause it would just split her focus.
rachel Oh well actually gonna use a nanny and uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.
mrs_green It's like you're a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay.
rachel Mrs. Kay! Oh yeah, she was sweet. She taught me Spanish. I actually think I remember some of it, tu madre es loca.
mrs_green Such a sweet woman.
rachel Well, however great she was I just can't afford that.
mrs_green Oh Rachel!
rachel What?
mrs_green I just had the greatest idea! I'm gonna come live with you!
rachel Wh-wh-what? What?
mrs_green Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna do this for my little girl. Aw, look at you. You have tears in your eyes.
rachel Yes. Yes I do.
joey All right Ross you're in the lead, would you like to take another question or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
ross The wheel has not been my friend tonight Joey. Uh, I'll take another question.
joey Okay, this is gonna be tough. Hold your breath.
ross It's okay, I'm ready.
joey No dude, you gotta hold your breath until you're ready to answer the question.
chandler This is ridiculous, he's not gonna hold his breath
joey Okay, what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia, Tris...Holy cow, that's a big word. Trisc... Seriously look at this thing. Chandler, how do you say that?
chandler Let me see that.
joey This one right here.
chandler Triscadecaphobia.
ross The fear of Triscuts!
joey No! No, fear of the number 13.
chandler Fear of Triscuts?
ross It's possible, they have really sharp edges.
joey All right Chandler, you're up.
ross Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?
chandler This game makes no sense!
ross Y'know what? You're just upset because you're losing.
chandler Oh come on Ross, I think we're all losers here.
joey All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card.
chandler Let me think. Let me think-Oh! I don't care.
joey You-you must choose Mr. Bing.
chandler Either, it makes no difference.
joey Choose, you jackass!
chandler I'll take a card.
joey Okay, you picked the Gimmie card! You get all of Ross's points!
ross What?!
chandler This game is kinda fun.
ross You don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points just 'cause you
chandler I don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.
rachel Why did you invite my mother?!
monica What?
rachel She wants to move in with me and Ross to help take care of the baby.
phoebe For how long?
rachel Eight weeks. I mean I love my mother, but my God, a long lunch with her is taxing.
monica I personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.
phoebe She can't hear you.
rachel What? You guys, come on! What am I going to do?
phoebe Well, if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.
rachel You're right. You're right. I mean I'm about to have a baby, I can tell my mother that I don't want her to just be sleeping on my couch! Oh my God! She's gonna want to sleep in my bed with me. This cannot happen!
monica That's right. That is right, you go over there and tell her you don't want her to live with you. Do not take no for an answer!
rachel Okay.
monica This is great! Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel! Y'know what? And I'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.
phoebe I have new respect for Chandler. All right everybody! It's time to open the presents!
monica Yes! Yes! And I think that the first gift that Rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby, because you're the most important person in this room. And in the world!
mrs_green Well uh, I don't have a gift because I wasn't invited until the last minute, but thank you so much for bringing that to everyone's attention.
phoebe How about you less important people, let's open your presents!
rachel Mom that's okay that you didn't get you a gift!
mrs_green Well, I kinda did. Me. Eight weeks of me.
rachel Oh yeah. Okay, see mom, the truth is I can do this on my own.
mrs_green Sweetheart I know you're gonna be terrific mom, I just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.
rachel But mom, I really know what I'm doing. I can handle this.
mrs_green Really? Remember Twinkles?
rachel He was a hamster! I am not going to vacuum up my baby!
phoebe Okay, come on Rach it's present time! Y'know you're the glue that's holding this whole party together. It's kinda falling apart here.
mrs_green Oh look.
rachel Wow!
phoebe Okay, this is from your friend at work.
rachel Oh my gosh! Oh wow! Oh, I know what this is! Wait a minute. That can't be right. Is that a beer bong for a baby?
mrs_green Darling, that's a breast pump!
rachel Did I say I was done guessing? Okay, thank you for that. Oh wow! What's this?
woman It's a diaper genie.
rachel Oh, it dispenses clean diapers!
woman No! It's where you put the dirty ones!
rachel Well that's gross, why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?
mrs_green Oh you're gonna do that ten times a day?
rachel What?! It goes ten times a day! What are we feeding this baby?! Indian food?!
mrs_green No dear, that's what babies do.
monica Rachel, listen to your mother. She is very smart.
mrs_green Plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you're trotting out to the garbage ten times a day?
rachel I don't know, I'd leave it on the changing table? What?! What'd I do? What'd I do?!
mrs_green You can't leave a baby alone!
rachel Oh come--Of course I know that. I mean of course you never leave a baby alone! I mean who would-she wouldn't be safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. Oh God, okay. Y'know what? I think opening the presents right now is a little overwhelming right now. So I think umm, I'm just gonna maybe open them a little bit later, but thank you all for coming. And for these beautiful gifts, and this basket is beautiful.
woman It's actually a bassinet.
rachel Okay mommy, don't ever leave me.
joey In what John Houston film would you hear this line, "Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"
chandler Treasure of the Sierra Madre!
joey Correct! There's a possible backwards bonus!
chandler Madre Sierra the of Treasure!
joey Yes!
chandler I'd like to go up the ladder of chance to the golden mud hut please.
joey Wise choice, how many rungs?
chandler Six!
joey That noise can only me one thing.
chandler Hungry monkey.
ross Hungry monkey! Haaa! I'd like a Wicked Wango card!
joey Okay, it's an audio question, name this television theme song.
ross Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Okay, I know this, give me-give me a second!
chandler Tell it to the Time Turtle!
ross Shut up! I Dream of Genie!
joey Yes! Yes, you're back in the lead!
ross I'd like to spin the wheel!
chandler Oh come on!!
joey All right! All right! Uh, umm, Super-Speedy Speed round!
ross Is there a hopping bonus?
joey Of course!
joey Who invented bifocals?
ross Ben Franklin.
joey Correct! Which monarch has ruled Great Britain the longest?
ross Queen Victoria.
joey Correct again! But, you forgot to switch legs between questions, so no hopping bonus!
ross Noooo!!! Every time!!!
joey Now, over to Chandler.
chandler I'd like a Google Card.
joey Are you sure?
chandler Yes! No! Google!
joey Oh my God! Congratulations Ross, because Chandler, you've been Bamboozled!
chandler Nooo!!
ross Yeah!!
chandler This is the best game ever!!!
rachel So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?
mrs_green Of course I am!
rachel Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot. I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes. And-and then guess what? The baby's coming and I don't know what to do. Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?
mrs_green No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.
rachel Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?
mrs_green I'm going to the bathroom.
rachel Okay.
mrs_green Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.
monica It is going to be okay! It was worth a shot.
ross Hey!
phoebe Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?
ross I just Bamboozled Chandler! Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.
phoebe Not if you were here.
ross Wow! It looks like we got a lot of good stuff.
rachel Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.
ross A Play-Dough Barber Shop?
rachel No. She's going to live with us for eight weeks.
ross Uh, what?
rachel Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
ross What-You're not serious. I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her. She'll drive us totally crazy.
mrs_green Hi Ross!
ross Hi roomie!
man Hey Joey, hi! I'm Ray; I'm the producer of the show.
joey It's a pleasure to meet you Ray.
ray And this is Duncan and Erin, they're gonna help us out with the audition. So uh, let's get the camera rolling.
joey Rightie-O Ray!
ray Whenever you're ready.
joey Hello, I'm Joey Tribbiani! Let's play Bamboozled! Erin, you get the first question! In hockey, who is known as The Great One?
erin Wayne Gretzky.
joey Correct! Now, would you like to pick a Wicked Wango card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?
ray Uh Joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules? We've eliminated all of that. No wheel, no cards.
joey What-Why?!
ray Uh well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.
joey Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!
ray Yeah all that's gone. It's basically just a simple question and answer game now.
joey Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?
ray Well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.
joey Let's play Bamboozled!
mrs_green ...and all those dinosaur nick-knacks you have Ross, I thought they might be more at home in the garage.
ross Well we...we don't have a garage.
mrs_green Did I say garage? I meant garbage.
ross Y'know what? Maybe, Mrs. Green, it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.
mrs_green Well Rachel needs help with the baby.
rachel I do. I really do. I don't know anything.
ross I'm-I'm sure that's not true.
rachel Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?
phoebe No, not a thing.
monica It's frightening.
ross Well uh, y'know what? Even if she doesn't know anything, I do! I have a son. And his mother and I didn't live together, and whenever he was with me I took care of him all the time, by myself.
mrs_green That's true. You do have another child.
ross Yeah.
mrs_green With another woman. Have you no control Ross?
ross That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.
mrs_green Well then you really don't need me to live with you.
ross Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed.
mrs_green You're gonna be a great father.
ross Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.
rachel Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!
ross Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?
rachel I hope you're going somewhere with this.
ross Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.
rachel Really?
ross I'm telling you.
rachel Thank you.
mrs_green All right you two, I'm gonna get going.
ross Oh.
mrs_green Oh no-no-no-no sweetheart, you stay put. I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here, which I almost wasn't.
monica You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?
phoebe Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.
monica Y'know what? You're-you're right.
phoebe Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.
monica Really?
phoebe Uh-huh!
monica Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!
mrs_green Spiteful?!
monica That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!
phoebe Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up
monica So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!
phoebe You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!
monica Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
phoebe You should be!
monica Yeah could-could-could you get me something to drink?
phoebe You got it!
monica Okay. Mrs. Green! Okay I'm really sorry!! I'm apologizing for the- Okay, I bit my tongue, but I'm still really sorry!
rachel Okay! I'm ready.
ross You sure?
rachel Yes, I've done my studying and I really know my stuff.
ross All right then. Rachel Green! Let's play Bamboozled! How do you test the temperature of the baby's bath water?
rachel Uh, put your elbow in it.
ross Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?
rachel Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.
ross That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?
rachel Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!
ross Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?
rachel A card! A card! I pick a card!
ross Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!
