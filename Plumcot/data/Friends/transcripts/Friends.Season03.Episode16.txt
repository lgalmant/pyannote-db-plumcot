joey_tribbiani Previously on Friends.
dr_ross_geller I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.
rachel_green You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you've got a girlfriend?
dr_ross_geller Is this about Mark?
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller Okay, it's not, it's not.
rachel_green Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.
dr_ross_geller Fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yoghurt, or something..
rachel_green No. A break from us.
rachel_green Then, we had this big, stupid fight, and I said I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
dr_ross_geller I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
mark#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode16 Hey, what do you want to drink?
dr_ross_geller Who's that?
rachel_green Nobody.
dr_ross_geller Is that Mark?
rachel_green Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Got it!
chloe Hey, come dance. What? Are you married? 'Cause that's okay.
monica_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
monica_geller How's the big anniversary dinner?
rachel_green Well, we never actually got to dinner.
monica_geller Ohhh, nice.
rachel_green No, we kinda broke up instead.
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green God, Monica it's on the ceiling.
monica_geller That's okay, this is more important than fruit on my ceiling! You broke up?!
rachel_green Yeah, but it's okay, because when Ross left Mark came over.
monica_geller Oh no!!
rachel_green No.
monica_geller Rachel, you and Mark?!
rachel_green No, no-no, it's okay, calm down. Mark and I talked, and I realised how much I love your stupid brother, and, yeah, we got our problems, but I really want to make it work.
chloe Morning!
rachel_green Hi, it's me. I've been trying to reach you all night. I feel awful. Please, Ross, you gotta know there is nothing between me and Mark. This whole break-up thing is just stupid.
dr_ross_geller Yeah!!
rachel_green Eh, I'm just so sorry I put you through it. And, I y'know, I don't want to get back together over a machine.
dr_ross_geller Na-huh.
rachel_green So, I love you.
dr_ross_geller I love you.
rachel_green And y'know what, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to bed now, but ah, on my way to work tomorrow morning, I'm gonna stop by around 8
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green Bye.
dr_ross_geller Chloe, Chloe how's it coming?!!
chloe Hey, what kind of puppy do you think I should get?
dr_ross_geller Umm, oh, hey, I don't know. How about a big one?
chloe But my apartment is so...
dr_ross_geller Well then a small one!! Listen, let's, we kinda have to get going!
chloe Wait! Where's my shoes?
dr_ross_geller You, you sure you need shoes? Okay.
chloe Do I know why we're rushing?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
chloe That's so great for you guys!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
chloe You must be so happy!
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes I am, one of the many things I'm feeling. Well....
chloe Good luck, with your girlfriend.
dr_ross_geller Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
rachel_green Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
rachel_green So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
dr_ross_geller Yes, you can, very much.
dr_ross_geller Ahhhh!!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey, why are you mopping your ceiling?
monica_geller Oh, there's banana on it.
phoebe_buffay Wow, I have the spirit of an old Indian women living in mine.
monica_geller So then you know?
phoebe_buffay The mailman was downstairs, so I brought up your mail.
monica_geller Oh, good. Thanks.
phoebe_buffay Now what is Fabutec?
monica_geller Okay, all right don't judge me to much. Okay? Um, but I saw this info-mercial, and um, I swear to you I have never-ever bought anything on TV before, except for this mop. But there was this stuff on leg waxing, it just, it looked so amazing....
phoebe_buffay Waxine!!
monica_geller Yes! Have you seen it?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's incredible! I so want to be a Waxine girl.
monica_geller I know!!
phoebe_buffay God. Do think it really doesn't hurt? 'Cause how can they do that?
monica_geller Hello! Organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest!
phoebe_buffay They have the best stuff in there.
chandler_bing Oh my God! Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. We figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone home to make up with Rachel. Which is probably what you shoulda done. Huh?
dr_ross_geller You think?! God, I, ah, I'm in hell. I mean what, what am I gonna do? Rachel's all like, 'I love you and, and let's work on this.' And all I can think about is, 'What is she gonna do? What is she gonna say?' when I tell her what I did.
chandler_bing Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?
dr_ross_geller What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?
joey_tribbiani Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.
chandler_bing He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but don't you think....
chandler_bing All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, okay.
joey_tribbiani All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?
dr_ross_geller What trail?
joey_tribbiani The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.
chandler_bing Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!
phoebe_buffay After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,
monica_geller Did that!
phoebe_buffay Grasp one of the linen strips by its 'easy grab tab' and pull it off in one quick pain free motion.
monica_geller Okay. Ow!!!!! Ow-oh-oh!
phoebe_buffay Was it not pain-free?
monica_geller No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.
phoebe_buffay Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.
monica_geller That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.
phoebe_buffay Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!
monica_geller Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
dr_ross_geller Chloe? Hi..
chloe Is this about me taking your watch?
dr_ross_geller You took my watch?
chloe I'm sorry, I do that.
dr_ross_geller Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?
chloe Oh no. I feel it isn't really anybody's business, y'know.
dr_ross_geller Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?
chloe Oh, well I tell Issac everything.
dr_ross_geller You tell, of course you do. Issac. Issac. Hey, Issac. Issac, hi! Y'know we haven't actually met...
isaac You dog!
dr_ross_geller Yes, I suppose I am a dog. But Issac, see I-I happen to have a girlfriend.
isaac Oh right, that Rachel chick from the coffee place.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that's the one. Listen, I don't want to hurt her.
isaac Oh, hey, man I know, doesn't matter how much we love 'em, monogamy is too cruel a rule.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?
isaac Aw, no problem dude. Y'know we got to look out for each other. We're the same, you and me.
dr_ross_geller Actually, no, we're not.
isaac Yeah, we are.
dr_ross_geller No, we're not.
isaac Yeah, we are.
dr_ross_geller No, we're not!!
isaac Okay, we're not.
dr_ross_geller Right.
isaac But, we are.
dr_ross_geller Fine. I just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.
isaac I can promise not to tell her again.
dr_ross_geller Jasmine?
jasmine Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller We met at Phoebe's birthday party, I'm, I'm Ross Geller.
jasmine You did a bad thing!
dr_ross_geller Yes, I did.
jasmine Very bad!
dr_ross_geller Very bad.
jasmine Very, very bad.
dr_ross_geller I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?
jasmine No.
dr_ross_geller Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?
jasmine All right.
dr_ross_geller Thank you, thank you.
jasmine But you should probably talk to my roommate, because I told him and he knows Phoebe too.
dr_ross_geller Who's your roommate?
dr_ross_geller Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
gunther I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
monica_geller Ow!
phoebe_buffay Oh!!
monica_geller Ow!! Ow!!
phoebe_buffay Ow!!!
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Ow!!!!!!! Ow-ow-ow-ow!
phoebe_buffay We're all right.
monica_geller It's okay, it's okay.
phoebe_buffay We're all right.
monica_geller We were just waxing our legs.
chandler_bing Off?!!
phoebe_buffay For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.
chandler_bing Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, come here.
chandler_bing Oh, that's mature.
joey_tribbiani Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
monica_geller That's right.
dr_ross_geller Come on, Rachel, come on! Talk to me! Please!!
rachel_green I can't talk to you. I can't even look at you right now!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Nothing, nothing.
monica_geller Rachel said everything was okay.
phoebe_buffay What, what are they talking about?
dr_ross_geller Rachel?
rachel_green Just get away from me!
dr_ross_geller No, it was a mistake! I made a mistake! Okay?
rachel_green A mistake?! What were you trying to put it in? Her purse?!
phoebe_buffay Whe-where did he put it?!
rachel_green Ross, you had sex with another woman!
monica_geller Oh my God.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I knew something had to be wrong, because my fingernails did not grow at all yesterday.
chandler_bing Yeah, well, I guess they had a fight, and he got drunk....
monica_geller Oh!! You guys knew about this and you didn't tell us?!
chandler_bing He has sex, and we get hit in our heads.
rachel_green Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
dr_ross_geller No!!
rachel_green Just get out! Now!!
dr_ross_geller No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
rachel_green Okay! All right! How was she?
chandler_bing Uh-oh.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Was she good?
joey_tribbiani Don't answer that.
rachel_green Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
dr_ross_geller She was...
joey_tribbiani Awful! Horrible!
chandler_bing She was not good. Not good.
joey_tribbiani She was nothing compared to you.
dr_ross_geller She, she was different.
joey_tribbiani Ewwwww!
chandler_bing Uh-oh.
rachel_green Good different?
dr_ross_geller Nobody likes change.
dr_ross_geller What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
phoebe_buffay Should we do something?
chandler_bing Yeah, never cheat on Rachel.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry. I wa-I was disgusted with myself, and this morning I was so, I was so upset and then I got your message and I was so happy, and all I wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible.
rachel_green Whoa!! Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. What time did your little friend leave? Oh my God. She was there? She was still there? She was in there, when I was in there?!
dr_ross_geller Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!
rachel_green And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!
dr_ross_geller Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.
rachel_green We were on a break!
dr_ross_geller That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.
rachel_green You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm not trying to get out of anything, okay. I thought our relationship was dead!
rachel_green Well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake!
joey_tribbiani Y'know what, I don't think we should listen to this anymore.
monica_geller What, what are you doing? You can't go out there.
joey_tribbiani Why not?! I'm hungry.
monica_geller Because they'll know we've been listening.
rachel_green God! And to have to hear about it from Gunther!!
dr_ross_geller Come on! Like I wanted him to tell you, I ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!
rachel_green Oh, that is so sweet. I think I'm falling in love with you all over again.
chandler_bing Y'know what, I think we can go out there. I mean they have more important things to worry about.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we'll be fine.
dr_ross_geller Look Rachel, I wanted to tell you, I thought I should, I-I did, and then Chandler and Joey convinced me not to.
chandler_bing Wax the door shut, we're never leaving, ever.
phoebe_buffay Hi, it's Phoebe. Listen someone's gonna have to take my 9
dr_ross_geller Don't you realise none of this would've ever happened if I didn't think at that same moment you weren't having sex with Mark?
rachel_green All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?
dr_ross_geller Yes I would.
rachel_green You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?
dr_ross_geller Yes.
rachel_green You knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were....
dr_ross_geller La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la! Okay, okay, yeah, I would have been devastated but, I would still want to be with you. Because it's, I mean it's you.
all@ Ohhhhh!
dr_ross_geller What? Come on Rach, tell me what you're thinking?
rachel_green I'm thinking, I'm gonna order a pizza.
dr_ross_geller Order a pizza like, 'I forgive you?'
joey_tribbiani Oh man, pizza? I like pizza. Put olives on the pizza.
phoebe_buffay We could eat the wax! It's organic.
chandler_bing Oh great, food with hair on it.
phoebe_buffay No, not the used wax.
chandler_bing Because that would be crazy?
dr_ross_geller Hey, can I, can I get in on that? Because I'm kinda hungry myself.
rachel_green Fine. Hi! Yes, I'd like to order a large pizza.
dr_ross_geller No anchovies.
rachel_green With ah, extra anchovies.
dr_ross_geller That's okay, I'll just pick 'em off.
rachel_green Yeah, and could you please chop some up and just put it right there in the sauce?
dr_ross_geller You can have the last piece, if you want.
rachel_green Well, I should think so. You slept with someone.
phoebe_buffay They're gonna get through this, aren't they?
chandler_bing Yeah, come on, it's Ross and Rachel, they've got too.
monica_geller What if they don't?
joey_tribbiani You think I need a new walk?
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Well y'know, I've been walking the same way since high school. Y'know, y'know how some guys they walk into a room and everybody takes notice. I think I need a 'take notice' walk.
chandler_bing Are you actually saying these words?
dr_ross_geller What, now you're not even taking to me? Look Rachel, I-I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry, I was out of my mind. I thought I'd lost you, I didn't know what to do. Come on! Come on, how insane must I have been to do something like this? Huh? I-I don't cheat right, I, that's not me, I'm not Joey!
joey_tribbiani Whoa-ho-ho! Yeah, okay.
monica_geller Hey. It's three in the morning. They don't know that I've come home yet. You notice how neither one of them are wondering where I am.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, y'know, people can be so self-involved.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what, y'know what, I'm-I'm not the one that wanted that, that break, okay. You're the one that bailed on us. You're the one that, that ran when things got just a little rough!
rachel_green That's....
dr_ross_geller That's what?!
rachel_green That is neither here nor there.
dr_ross_geller Okay, well here we are. Now we're in a tough spot again, Rach. What do you want to do? How do you want to handle it? Huh? Do you wanna fight for us? Or, do you wanna bail? Look, I, I did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing. Okay? And I'm sorry, I wish I could take it back, but I can't. I just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good. Rachel, I love you so much.
rachel_green No Ross!! Don't! You can't just kiss me and think you're gonna make it all go away, okay? It doesn't work that way. It doesn't just make it better. Okay?
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, okay.
rachel_green I think you should go.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I really think you need to go now.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay. This morning you said there was nothing so big that we couldn't work past it together...
rachel_green Yeah, what the hell did I know!
dr_ross_geller Look, look, there's got to be a way we can work past this. Okay, I can't imagine, I can't imagine my life without you. Without, without these arms, and your face, and this heart. Your good heart Rach, and, and....
rachel_green No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever. God, and now I just can't stop picturing with her, I can't, it doesn't matter what you say, or what you do, Ross. It's just changed, everything. Forever.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but this can't be it, I mean.
rachel_green Then how come it is?
phoebe_buffay They've been quiet for a long time.
joey_tribbiani Maybe she killed him?
chandler_bing Let's go.
chandler_bing Is that your new walk?
joey_tribbiani No, I really have to pee.
