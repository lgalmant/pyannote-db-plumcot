monica Alright. Phoebe?
phoebe Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
ross Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
chandler Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
rachel See, there's always one guy. "If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."
all Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.
monica Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
joey Probably kill myself!
monica .Excuse me?
joey Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
ross Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
joey You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
monica How does she do that?
ross I cannot sleep in a public place.
monica Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
phoebe Oh! What what what!..Hi.
ross It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
monica What's going on with you?
phoebe I got no sleep last night!
ross Why?
phoebe My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
monica Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
phoebe Thanks.
joey ..Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
chandler You got waaaay too much free time.
joey Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
chandler Happy birthday, pal!
joey We love you, man.
ross Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
joey So?
ross So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
chandler Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."
ross Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
monica Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
ross Ohhh.
joey What's wrong with the twentieth?
chandler Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
ross Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
joey The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
chandler C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh?
ross What are you doing?
chandler I have no idea.
joey C'mon, Ross!
ross Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
chandler You got it.
rachel Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
phoebe I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
monica Wow, you worked in a mine?
phoebe I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
rachel God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally--not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
chandler Oh, this is not that bad.
joey Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
ross You can totally, totally live on this.

joanne Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
rachel Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
leslie I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
rachel So what's going on with you?
joanne Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?
kiki And while we're on the subject of news..
phoebe Look, look, I have elbows!
chandler ..Poulet passes it up to Leetch!
joey Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass!
chandler We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
ross Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- Sorry. Sorry.
joey What?
ross Peach pit.
chandler Yes, Bunny?
ross Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
joey -Peaches?
ross Actually, nectarines, but basically...
chandler Could've been a peach.
ross Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- -the bus stop... I'm fine.
joey Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
rachel So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
kiki Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!
joanne Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
rachel Okay.
joanne When are you coming home?
rachel What? Guys, I'm not.
joanne C'mon, this is us.
rachel I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
kiki Waitressing?
rachel Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
leslie Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
monica Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
rachel What's that?
monica Weeeell, it's rum, and-
rachel Okay.
monica We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister...
phoebe Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
monica Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
rachel Oh, God, ask them what they want.
monica Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
rachel But I haven't used my card in weeks!
monica That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
rachel They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
monica Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
rachel Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister!
ross Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
chandler What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
ross No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
joey C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
monica You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
rachel Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
phoebe You are just like Jack.
rachel ..Jack from downstairs?
phoebe No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
monica Ah, the other Jack.
phoebe Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
rachel Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
phoebe Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
rachel But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
phoebe Floopy?
rachel Yeah.
monica So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
phoebe Oh, like that's a word.
rachel Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
monica ..Pheebs?
phoebe Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
rachel Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
ross Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
chandler See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
ross Pass it! Pass it!

chandler 'Scuse me.
receptionist It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.
chandler Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.
receptionist Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there.
ross Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
receptionist Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
joey Well, how long do you think it'll be?
receptionist Any minute now.
ross Hey, this- Heyy...

rachel Thank God. Food.

phoebe What?
monica Do you have a plan?
phoebe I don't even have a 'pl'.
pizza_guy Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?
rachel No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
pizza_guy Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!
monica Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
pizza_guy Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!

phoebe Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- Hey, that's not for you, bitch!
chandler Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba-!
monica Light still out?
rachel Yeah.
monica Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
rachel Oh please, they're having sex.
monica_and_phoebe Shut up!
rachel So, whaddya think George is like?
monica I think he's shy.
phoebe Yeah?
monica Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
ross I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
chandler Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
joey He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
ross Look, it's just a little more complicated...
chandler Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
ross Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
chandler Then what?
ross My first time with Carol was...
joey What?
ross It was my first time.
joey With Carol? Oh.
chandler So in your whole life, you've only been with one--oh.
