rachel Here you go Pheebs. Who else wants one of my special homemade brownies?
chandler I will have one.
chandler Okay, I'm not gonna have one.
ross Neither will I.
phoebe No, no, it's just my tooth.
chandler All right I'll have one.
ross So what's a matter, you need a dentist? I've got a good one.
phoebe No thanks, I have a good one too. I just, I, I can't see him.
chandler See that is the problem with invisible dentists.
ross Why? Why can't you go to him?
phoebe Because, every time I go to the dentist, somebody dies.
chandler That is so weird, because every time I go to the dentist, I look down the hygienist's blouse.
rachel Phoebe, what? Umm...what?!
phoebe Yeah, yeah, first there was my aunt Mary, and then there was umm, John, my mailman, and then my, my cowboy friend 'Albino Bob'.
rachel And all these people actually died?
phoebe Yes, while I was in the chair! That's why I take such good care of my teeth now, y'know, it's not about oral hygiene, I floss to save lives!
ross Pheebs, come on, you didn't kill anybody, these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist. It's, it's, it's just ah, a coincidence.
phoebe Well tell that to them. Oh! You can't, their dead.
ross Thanks, Gunther. Hey! Umm, can I get a napkin too?
gunther Oh, like you don't already have everything.
phoebe Ow! Ow!
rachel Phoebe, your in pain, would you just go to the dentist, just go.
phoebe All right, fine, fine, but if you're my next victim, don't come back as a poltergeist and like suck me into the TV set.
rachel I promise.
phoebe Although, don't feel like you can't visit.
joey Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?
ross No, no he's not.
monica You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband.
ross What? So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?
joey Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not.
rachel Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him.
joey It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him.
phoebe Well, you could wait 'til I go to the dentist, maybe I'll kill him.
joey Ewww! Ugly Naked Guy is using his new hammock. It's like a Play-Doo Fat Factory.
phoebe Well, I'm going to the dentist, so listen, okay, just be on the look out for anything that, that, that you can fall into, or, or that can fall on you, or... All right, just look out! Okay, And um, I also just wanna, I just wanna tell you all that um......
ross Okay, I have a problem I have to go into work for a few hours, some kids messed up the Homo Sapien display.
joey What did they do?
ross Well, they painted over the word 'Sapien' for one thing, then they rearranged the figures, let's just leave it at that.
monica So, do you want me to watch Ben for you?
ross Yes, that's what I was going to ask, thank you.
rachel Whoa! Wait! Hello! What about me?
ross You? You! Want to watch Ben? Yes! That'd be great, no, I just wanted to ask Monica, because I know how empty her life is.
joey Hey-hey, Ross?
ross Yeah.
joey I've got a science question.
ross Hmm?
joey If the Homo Sapiens, were in fact 'Homo-sapien', is that why there extinct?
ross Joey, Homo Sapiens are people.
joey Hey-hey, I'm not judging.
rachel Look Benny, spoon. Spoon. Come on! All right, y'know what I think he's bored.
monica Here. Ben, do you wanna play the airplane game, do you wanna show Rachel? Come here. We're gonna do something fun. Okay. Weee!! Weee!!
monica Who's so brave, you're so brave, yes you are, you're so brave.
rachel Okay. Okay honey, he's fine, he's fine, let's just put him down. Come here, Ben. See that's a good boy. How could you do that to him!! Ross trusted me, what is he going to say?!
monica He's not gonna say anything, because we're not gonna tell him.
rachel We're not?!
monica No we're not.
rachel All right, I like that.
monica Okay.
rachel So we're okay, we're okay, we're okay, aren't we? No, we're not okay, we're not okay, there's a bump, there's a bump.
monica Oh my God! Well push it in! Push it in!
rachel I cannot push it in!
monica Okay, we're gonna need a distraction.
rachel Okay, okay, okay.
monica I got it!
rachel Okay.
monica The second that Ross walks in that door, I want you take him back to your bedroom and do whatever it is that you do that makes him go, rweee!!
rachel Or. We could put a hat on his head.
monica A hat! Yes! We need a hat.
rachel We need a hat..
monica Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
rachel Oh, oh, oh, I'll get 'Rainy Day Bear'!!
monica Because he'll know what to do? Oh my God, you're a genius!
rachel Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though.
monica Give it. Give it.
rachel Okay.
monica_and_rachel Oh!!
rachel Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today.
chandler Hey! Hold on a minute, hold on a second. Do you think these pearls are nice?
joey I'd really prefer a mountain bike.
chandler Janice's birthday is coming up, I want to get her something speacial. Come in here with me.
joey Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, whoa. Do you ah, want to get her something speacial, get her flowers, get her candy, get her gum, girls love gum.
chandler That's a good idea, 'Dear Janice have a Hubba-Bubba birthday'. I would like to get her something serious.
joey Oh, you want something serious. Y'know what you should do, you should get her one of those um, barium enemas. Those are dead serious.
chandler All right. Look, I'm gonna go in here, and you don't buy me anything ever.
joey No, no, you can't, you can't, okay, you can't, you can't buy her pearls, you just can't, you can't, you can't.
chandler Why not?!
joey Oh God. Uh, okay, here's the thing, this is the thing, okay, the thing is...
chandler What is the thing?
joey Okay. I went down to the 'Mattress King' showroom and, and I saw Janice, kissing her ex-husband.
chandler What?
joey They were in his office.
chandler Well she, she wouldn't do that, she's with, she's with me.
joey I'm telling you man, I saw it.
chandler Yeah, well, you're wrong! Okay, you're wrong.
joey I'm not wrong! I wish I was. I'm sorry. Bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?
monica It just makes more sense as an ensemble.
rachel Right.
monica Besides, it takes the focus off the hat.
phoebe No! Oh! You're alive! You're alive!
rachel See Pheebs, I promised you no one would die, didn't I?
phoebe Yeah, well, we'll see about that. Can I use your phone? I just wanna call everyone I know.

ben Monica bang!
rachel Okay, I heard that.
monica Did he just say 'Monica bang'?
rachel Uh-huh.
monica Oh my God! He's gonna rat me out!
ben Monica bang!
monica Oh-ho-ho, sweetie, sweetie, you gotta stop saying that, now. It's no big deal, it's not even worth mentioning, you see we all do it all the time. See watch this, Ben, Ben, Ben. Ow, Monica bang! Everybody bang. Ben bang. Rachel bang. Bang, Rachel bang! Oh, isn't that fun?
rachel Look at that! Look at that! We all do it. Okay, I'm stopping now.
monica You okay?
rachel Oh yeah! Y'know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.
janice How's my Bing-a-ling?
chandler Ah, I don't know, you tell me. Anything you ah, wanna tell me, because, if you ah, you should, if you, you would, tell me.
janice Why are your eyes so white?
chandler You tell me! Maybe, it's because I was just fooling with my ex! Oh no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, that was you!!
janice Oh my God!!
chandler All right!
janice How did you know?
chandler Joey told me, he saw you two kissing.
janice In the park?
chandler No! In his office! How many kisses were there?
janice Just those two!
chandler Wh-wh-why, wh-why, why, why was there kissing!? There should be no kissing!!
janice Oh, I'm sorry honey, I'm so, so, haaaaa! I'm so, so sorry, I just haaaaaa! But I, oh what happened was, I-I-I can't breathe. Can you get me a bag, or something?
chandler Here.
janice The receipt.
chandler I'll take it! All right look, I gotta know. Are you finished with me? Are you finished with him? Do you still love him? Do you still love me? All right look, I'm gonna need an actual answer here okay, so which is it, him or me?
janice I don't know.
phoebe Okay. If you're alive you answer your phone!
monica Okay, Ben, I won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream for dinner, if you don't tell about our little bonking incident.
rachel Monica, number one, I don't think Ben understands the concept of bribery, and number two, I... What?!
joey You said number two.
rachel I also said number one.
joey I know.
ross Hey! Everyone.
rachel Hi!
ross How's my little boy?
rachel He's perfect, he's never been better.
ross What'd you do, take him whaling?
ben Monica.
ross Oh my God, he just said your name, that's great! Good job Ben.
ben Monica bang!
monica Oh that's right, that's what I'd sound like if I exploded.
phoebe Woo-Hoo! The curse is broken! I called everybody I know, and everyone is alive.
joey Uh.
phoebe What?
joey Ugly Naked Guy looks awfully still.
phoebe Oh my God! I killed him! I killed another one! And this curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.
rachel Well maybe he's just taking a nap.
joey I'm tellin' ya, he hasn't moved since this morning.
monica All right, we should call somebody.
ross And tell them what? The naked guy we stare at all the time isn't moving.
rachel Well, we have gotta find out if he's alive.
monica How are we gonna do that? There's no way.
joey Well, there is one way. His window's open, I say, we poke him.
joey Hey! Y'know how we ah, save all those chopsticks for no reason we get when we get Chinese food?
chandler Yeah.
joey Well, now we got a reason.
chandler What?
joey Well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.
chandler All right.
joey Hey uh, what's a matter?
chandler I talked to Janice.
joey Oh my God, is she going back to him?
chandler She doesn't know. Says she loves us both. Y'know I woke up this morning and I was in love, well I was happy. Y'know it serves me right for buying that twelve pack of condoms. And now I can't even return them, because she choked on the reciept!
joey What are you ah, what are you gonna do?
chandler I don't know, y'know. What, what, would you do?
joey Well, it doesn't matter what I would do.
chandler Come on, tell me.
joey All right, you're probably not gonna want to hear this but ah, if it was me, and this is just me, I would ah, I would bow out.
chandler What? What are you, what are you talking about?
joey They have a kid together, y'know. They're like, they're like a family, and if, I don't know, there's chance they could make that work, I know I wouldn't want to be the guy who stood in the way of that. Are you okay? Do you wanna ah, come poke a nude guy?
ross Well, he's finally alseep. About that ah, bump on his head?
rachel Are you, are you, are you sure it's ah, a new bump? I mean, no offense, I've always thought of Ben as a fairly bumpy headed child.
ross It's okay if he bumps his head, kids bump their heads all the time, y'know, it was your first time babysitting, I figured you did the best you could.
rachel I did!
ross I know! I'm saying you have to watch them all the time.
rachel I did!! I watched! I watched! I watched Monica bang his head against that thing!
ross Monica did it?
ross Monica?
monica Yeah.
ross Umm, did you notice anything wierd about Ben today?
monica No. Why?
ross Well, I was just playing with him, and y'know we were doing the alphabet song, which he used to be really good at, but suddenly he's leaving out 'e' and 'f.' It's like they just ah, I don't know, fell out of his head.
monica Really?!
ross Oh, and also, he's, he's walkin' kind of funny, his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg, and he's in there just sort of y'know...
monica Oh my God, I wrecked your baby!!
rachel I hope it's still funny when you're in hell.
monica You jerk! You know how much I love that kid!
ross Monica bang! Monica bang! Ow!
rachel I'll get the hat.
chandler Janice, I have something I need to tell you, and I want you to let me get through it, because it's, it's, it's not gonna be easy.
janice Okay.
chandler I think you should go back with Gary. I don't wanna be the guy that breaks up a family, y'know when my parents split up, it was because of that guy. Whenever I would see him I was always think y'know 'You're the reason, you are the reason why their not together.' and I hated that guy. And it didn't matter how nice he was, or how happy he made my Dad.
janice Wow!
chandler Yeah, well. It's the right thing to do.
janice Oh! You're right. Oh God. But, before I can say 'good-bye', there's something I really need you to know, Chandler. The way I feel about you, it's like, I finally understand what Lionel Richie's been singing about. Y'know, I mean what we have, it's like movie love, you're my soulmate, and I can't believe we're not going to be spending the rest of our lives together.
chandler Then don't leave me!
janice What?
chandler Forget what I said, I was babbling! Pick me!
janice No, you were right, you were right. I mean, I-I-I've got to give my marriage another chance.
chandler No you don't! No, no, no, I say you have to give your divorce another chance.
janice I'm sorry.
chandler Ohhh. Don't go.
janice No, I-I-I gotta go.
chandler No. No! No! No!
janice Honey, honey, people are looking.
chandler I don't care! I don't care!!
janice Yeah, um, I'm, I'm leaving now.
chandler You can't leave! I have your shoe!
janice Good-bye Chandler Bing.
gunther Rachel has those in burgendy.
joey All right now remember, something this big and long is going to be difficult to manuver, fortunately I have a lot of experience in that area.
ross Can we please focus here, a naked man's life hangs in the balance!
phoebe I'm telling you he's dead. What we are about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick.
joey All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke. Steady. Steady. Okay, a little higher. Careful of the angle. Okay, okay, we're approaching the window Thread the needle. Thread the needle.
phoebe He's alive! He's a-live!!!
monica And yet, we're still poking him.
joey Okay, retract the device, retract the device.
ross He does not look happy.
rachel Hey-hey, now he's showing us his poking device.
joey Hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy!
chandler I'll hold you close in my arms. I can't resist your charms. And love....
phoebe Love....
chandler_and_phoebe I'll be a fool for you. I'm sure, you know I don't mind.
chandler No you know I don't mind.
chandler_and_phoebe Yes! You mean the world the world to me. Oh...
chandler I know.
phoebe I know.
chandler I've found.
phoebe I've found....
chandler_and_phoebe ..in you, my endless love. My endless love.
