dr_ross_geller Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Geller's class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"
chandler_bing Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, there's a big selling calendar, eh?
rachel_green Who wrote it?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.
joey_tribbiani Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Oh, 'cause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, there's your admirer.
chandler_bing A hot girl's at stake and all of the sudden he's Rain Man.
rachel_green Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?
dr_ross_geller It's a girl! Anyway, it wou-it wouldn't matter. Okay? Because I'm a teacher and she's a student.
chandler_bing Oh, is that against the rules?
dr_ross_geller No, but it is frowned upon.
chandler_bing I see.
dr_ross_geller Besides, there's a big age difference.
joey_tribbiani Oh, well think of it like this, when you're 90
dr_ross_geller I know when I'm 90 she'll be like 80 and it won't seem like such a big difference.
joey_tribbiani No that's not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when you're 90 you'll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.
joey_tribbiani Hey Chandler! Y'know that girl you went to college with who-who became a movie director?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.
phoebe_buffay What's a Movement class?
monica_geller It's Chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.
joey_tribbiani Oh well listen, anyway she's directing the new Al Pacino movie. You gotta get me an audition!
chandler_bing Oh, I don't know man. I haven't talked to her in like ten years.
joey_tribbiani No-no-no, please-please Chandler I-I-I would owe you so much!
chandler_bing You do owe me so much. You owe me three thousand, four hundred
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey dude, why are you changing the subject? Why? Will you make the call or what?
chandler_bing Oh okay, I'll-I'll try.
joey_tribbiani All right! Thanks! You're the best! Now listen, the last day of auditions is Thursday. Okay? So I gotta get in there by Thursday. Okay? Just remember Thursday. Thursday. Can you remember Thursday?
chandler_bing Yeah so, Tuesday?
joey_tribbiani Thursday! Look if you need help remembering think of like this, the third day. All right? Monday, one day. Tuesday, two day. Wednesday, when? Huh? What day? Thursday! The third day! Okay?!
chandler_bing Thank you.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
rachel_green Hey Mon? I'm gonna check my messages.
chandler_bing You just thought of that in there?
monica_geller Yeah sure, nature called, she wanted to see who else did.
rachel_green Hello? Uh, Rachel. Great, someone is in our apartment. Call the cops!
monica_geller You're on the phone!
rachel_green Oh my God! Oh my God! Thank you! That was the fire department, there was a fire at our place!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! How bad was it?
rachel_green Well, he didn't say, but it was a fire. I'm guessing not very good. Come on, we gotta go!
monica_geller Come on!
chandler_bing What are you smiling about? What is so funny?
joey_tribbiani The part I want to audition for is a fireman, this is so meant to be!
burt Wow! It looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester!
elizabeth_stevens Professor Geller?
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
elizabeth_stevens I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
dr_ross_geller Oh thank you. Thanks very much. Ow!
elizabeth_stevens Uh, I'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation
dr_ross_geller That was you?
elizabeth_stevens Yeah. I felt a little weird about it. You're a teacher. I'm a student. But would you maybe want to go out with me sometime?
dr_ross_geller Oh I, I don't-I don't think that would be the best idea.
elizabeth_stevens Oh, because I was thinking, the semester's over; you're not my teacher anymore.
dr_ross_geller What time?
elizabeth_stevens Oh, y'know what? Forget it, you already gave me an A.
dr_ross_geller Gotcha.
elizabeth_stevens I'm kidding!
dr_ross_geller Oh! So-so seriously, what time?
phoebe_buffay Coming through! Oh! Coming through! Oh! Hello! Hi! No! Right! Coming through!
monica_geller Oh well, it's not so bad.
fireman_1 Yeah, most of the damage is pretty mostly contained in the bedrooms.
phoebe_buffay Oh!
rachel_green My God!
joey_tribbiani Hey buddy, do you think I can borrow your uniform this Thursday?
fireman_1 Excuse me?
monica_geller Joey! He's working! You would look good in that.
joey_tribbiani Oh, how bad is it?
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's bad. It's really bad. The only thing in there that isn't burned is an ass. Which I do not remember buying!
chandler_bing How's your room Rach?
rachel_green Everything's ruined. My bed. My clothes. Look at my favorite blue sweater.
monica_geller Isn't that mine?
rachel_green Fine! I'm sorry for your loss!
fireman_1 So uh, you're not gonna be able to live here for a while, you ladies have a place to stay?
rachel_green Wow! Oh-okay, look pal, I am not in the mood to be hit on right now! But if you give me your number I will call you some other time.
monica_geller Yes, they can stay with us.
chandler_bing Have you figured out what started the fire Mr. Fireman?
fireman_1 Well uh, do either of you smoke?
phoebe_buffay No, not usually. But yeah, I could use one right now.
fireman_1 No-no-no, do you uh light candles? Burn incense?
phoebe_buffay Yes! I do! All the time! I love them! Oh my God! I did it! It's me! It's me! I burned down the house! I burned down the house!
rachel_green Okay Phoebe calm down, there's no need to place blame. Okay? I warned her about those candles.
chandler_bing God, it's great to catch up! I can't believe how long it's been!
joey_tribbiani Chandler, is that
chandler_bing Oh that's great! Good for you.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey listen
chandler_bing Okay! So yeah, maybe we can get together umm... Can you hold for one second please? What?!
joey_tribbiani When you're off the phone, do you wanna get a pizza?
chandler_bing Hi! I'm back. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. Well, we'll do it then. Okay, bye-bye.
joey_tribbiani Hey listen, so when's-when's my audition? I mean I know it's Thursday, but what time?
chandler_bing Hi.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing We didn't get to the audition. I'm gonna take her to coffee and then we'll do it then.
joey_tribbiani Ah-ha!
monica_geller Wow! So, now you're going on a date with this girl?
chandler_bing Honey, it is not a date! I haven't talked to her in ten years! You can't just call up somebody you haven't talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, y'know? You gotta, you got to put in some time.
monica_geller You're right, I'm sorry. It's not like you're y'know, going out with an ex-girlfriend.
chandler_bing No, we only went out once.
monica_geller You dated her!
chandler_bing Not once!
monica_geller All right, well why don't I go out with an ex-boyfriend and do Joey a favor?!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you wanna do Joey a favor, maybe you go out with Joey.
chandler_bing Oh that's great, my friend Joey's in the movie business.
dana_keystone Y'know who I ran into from school? Howie.
chandler_bing My friend's name is Joey.
dana_keystone Apparently Howie's editing now. Yeah, he-he-he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie. Can you believe that?! Y'know I-I-I haven't spoken to him in like ten years and he asks me for a favor!
chandler_bing Yeah, I've always hated that Howie.
dana_keystone No, no "How you doing?" Man, I mean not even a cup of coffee first!
chandler_bing The nerve huh?
dana_keystone Yeah!
chandler_bing Refill?
monica_geller Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?
rachel_green Oh my God! It sure didn't look this way when I lived here.
monica_geller I know! Now look, there's only one problem though. There's only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joey's.
phoebe_buffay Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess you should get to stay here.
rachel_green Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no one's fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.
phoebe_buffay Well no, it was my fault so you should get the nice room.
rachel_green Okay!
monica_geller So Rach! You're the first guest at Hotel Monica! Umm, you'll just have to tell me how you like your eggs in the morning. And I thought I would bring them to you, y'know, in bed. Oh, you have been through so much.
rachel_green I have.
joey_tribbiani This right here is where I keep the pizza. And uh that's where the napkin is.
phoebe_buffay What's that smell?
joey_tribbiani I know!
elizabeth_stevens Oh please! It was such a big class! You never even noticed me!
dr_ross_geller What? Of course I did! You uh, you sat next to Sleepy Sleeperson.
elizabeth_stevens Who?
dr_ross_geller Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyone's name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.
elizabeth_stevens Oh yeah. So umm, did you have a nickname for me?
dr_ross_geller Umm, no. No.
elizabeth_stevens Yes you did! What was it?
dr_ross_geller Umm, it's Cutie McPretty.
elizabeth_stevens Ohh that's so sweet!
dr_ross_geller Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-I'm having a great time! Y'know how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but it's not. I mean it's not at all.
burt Dr. Geller!
dr_ross_geller Burt!
phoebe_buffay So did you sleep well last night?
rachel_green I did.
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
rachel_green I did, Monica was so sweet she left a little mint on my pillow.
phoebe_buffay Y'know what Joey left on my pillow?
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Gum!
fireman_2 Well, we determined the cause of the fire.
phoebe_buffay Yeah I know, it was my candle. My candle!
fireman_2 No, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom. It's looks like a curling iron.
phoebe_buffay I don't use a curling iron.
fireman_2 Well someone does.
rachel_green Well, don't look at me! My hair's straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!
fireman_2 It could've been a hair straightener.
rachel_green Oh.
joey_tribbiani This is where I keep the pizza. And-Hey! Where did the napkin go?!
monica_geller Now there you go! I wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes!
phoebe_buffay Thanks Monica!
monica_geller Does that smell bother you?
phoebe_buffay What the smell from Joey's? No, I can hardly smell it over here.
monica_geller Well you let me know if you can, because y'know I can bake a pie to cover it.
phoebe_buffay I can smell it a little, bake the pie.
monica_geller Okay!
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Hello? Oh yes, one minute please. It's for you. It's the fire inspector.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Hello? Yeah this is Phoebe. Really?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire. No-no, it was the candles. It's very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is... Uhh... Uhh... Okay. Well, I have to go now.
dr_ross_geller We had such a great time! She's-she's incredible! I thought the-the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't. It wasn't at all. Elizabeth is very mature for her age. A concept lost on some people!
monica_geller So it's okay to date a student.
dr_ross_geller Well, not really. I mean technically it's-it's not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.
monica_geller Well Ross, you be careful now. You don't want to get a reputation as y'know Professor McNailshisstudents.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. What-what should I do?
joey_tribbiani Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean what's more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.
monica_geller Joey that is so sweet.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey! So, how did it go with Dana? Any reason I should leave a block of time open say Thursday?
chandler_bing I couldn't do it.
joey_tribbiani You couldn't do it?!
chandler_bing Hey, relax I just need more time. We're going to dinner tonight.
monica_geller What?! You're going out with her again!
dr_ross_geller Going out with who?
chandler_bing Uh, Dana Keystone from college.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah! Wasn't she uh
chandler_bing No, that was Dana Caplin.
the_guys#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode18 Ohhhh!
monica_geller Joey! You didn't even know her!
joey_tribbiani Ah whatever!
chandler_bing Great story again! The yarns that you weave! Woo-hoo-hoo!
dana_keystone Y'know uh, actually I-I-I should get going.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no! Stay! Stay! Because you-you should you-you-you should stay!
dana_keystone Wow. Oh, I am really flattered, but I just I don't feel that way about you.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, that's not-No-no-no!
dana_keystone I'm sorry Chandler, y'know you are such a sweet guy and I, I don't want to hurt you. Oh, I wish there was something I can do to make you feel better.
chandler_bing No-no-Really?!
dana_keystone Of course!
chandler_bing Well, it just hurts so bad. I uh
dana_keystone Ohh, I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Well maybe there is one thing you can do.
dana_keystone What?! Anything! Anything!
chandler_bing Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?
dana_keystone Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?
chandler_bing Well, the heart wants what it wants. I'll see you later.
monica_geller Hey! How's it goin'?
phoebe_buffay Well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.
monica_geller Yes it has! I made cookies!
phoebe_buffay Oh that's all right. I'm still full from your homemade potato chips.
monica_geller But you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Oh-ho! But not in here! Can't eat 'em in bed, remember? No crumbies!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'll be out in a second.
monica_geller Okay!
monica_geller What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay That doesn't lock does it?
rachel_green Oh, Joey! Sorry!
joey_tribbiani No that's all right. Don't worry about it.
rachel_green Oh but look! That's gonna leave a stain!
joey_tribbiani Rach! Hey! It's fine! You're at Joey's!
rachel_green Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Look!
rachel_green I've never lived like this before.
joey_tribbiani I know.
joey_tribbiani All right, don't waste it, I mean its still food.
dr_ross_geller What do you want to do now? Huh? You wanna go get a drink?
elizabeth_stevens Uhh, I can't.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you have some studying to do?
elizabeth_stevens No, I have some turning 21 to do.
dr_ross_geller Y'know I remember when uh, when I was in college, we used to
elizabeth_stevens What are you doing?
dr_ross_geller Nothing, I'm-I'm just, I'm so comfortable with you!
elizabeth_stevens Do you not want to be seen with me?
dr_ross_geller What? No! Of course, of course I do! Are-are they gone?
elizabeth_stevens Uh no, they're still here but I think I'm about to leave.
dr_ross_geller What?! No! No! Wait! You're right, this is stupid. Who cares what people think? I mean, I mean we like each other right? There's nothing wrong with that. Come on. Burt? Lydia? Mel? This is Elizabeth.
elizabeth_stevens Hi!
lydia Aren't you in my Popular Culture class?
dr_ross_geller That's right Lydia, Elizabeth here is a student and uh, we're dating. And you may frown upon that, but we're not gonna hide it anymore.
mel You are so fired.
dr_ross_geller What?
burt They're gonna fire you! You can't date a student! It's against the rules.
dr_ross_geller Really? Its not just frowned upon?
rachel_green I love it at Joey's!
joey_tribbiani Hey, here you go.
chandler_bing Ni-hi-ice!
rachel_green Thanks!
chandler_bing So, you busy Thursday?
joey_tribbiani Oh, very funny. I don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be Thursday. You got me the audition?! Let's hug it up!
chandler_bing Okay. Okay. What are you gonna do to me if you get the part?
phoebe_buffay Hey! Hi!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay Listen umm, yeah okay, I need to talk to you!
rachel_green Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay Now I know that they said that the umm, the hair straightener started the fire but I think I'm partly at fault. You see, I didn't, I didn't tell you but umm, but I-I had recently refilled the tissues and so y'know let's just face it, that's just kindling! So I think it's better that I stay at Joey's.
rachel_green No, no-no-no. Phoebe, this was my fault and besides y'know what? I'm fine here.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Oh umm, Chandler, Monica is looking for you.
chandler_bing Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah she said something about crumbies.
chandler_bing No! No! No! I was so careful!
phoebe_buffay Okay, you have to switch with me! Monica is driving me crazy!
joey_tribbiani That's right, all the ladies want to stay at Joey's.
rachel_green No! No! Phoebe, come on! I don't want to switch! Please come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
phoebe_buffay No but at Monica's you can eat cookies over the sink!
rachel_green I know. I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay All right fine! This looks like so much fun.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
phoebe_buffay God, what a mess.
dr_ross_geller Wow! It actually is in the handbook. I can't date you or have a hot plate in my office. I can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.
elizabeth_stevens For what it's worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.
dr_ross_geller I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we can't date. It's against the rules. It's forbidden.
elizabeth_stevens Wow!
dr_ross_geller What?
elizabeth_stevens Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, it's really hot.
dr_ross_geller Really?
elizabeth_stevens Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Well I-I-I don't care how hot it is it's-it's uh, it's wrong.
elizabeth_stevens Stop it!
dr_ross_geller No! No! It's wrong! It's-it's-it's naughty. It's taboo.
elizabeth_stevens Shut the book!
dr_ross_geller Let's also get a hot plate!
chandler_bing Hey!
