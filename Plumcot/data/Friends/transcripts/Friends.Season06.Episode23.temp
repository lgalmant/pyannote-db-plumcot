chandler Pheebs, can you help me pick out an engagement ring for Monica? I can't figure this out! It's so hard! Should I get her a Tiffany cut or a Princess cut or a-ah-ah! Paper cut!
phoebe Now, have you told anyone else?
chandler No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.
phoebe You told me.
chandler Well, it's because I trust you, you're one of my best friends, and you walked in on me when I was looking at ring brochures.
phoebe Yeah well, once again not knocking pays off. I only wish you hadn't been on the toilet.
chandler Me too.
joey Hey.
chandler Hey.
phoebe Hey! So Chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse?
chandler Oh all right.
phoebe Yeah, coffeehouse.
ross Oh perfect, we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.
chandler Oh well, we don't because we got...the...other pl-place.
ross How rude.
joey Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?
phoebe So how are things going with Paul?
rachel Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.
phoebe That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.
rachel So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?
phoebe No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.
paul Hi honey.
rachel Hi!
phoebe Watch this.
paul How are you?
rachel Okay.
phoebe Hi Paul!
paul Hi Phoebe.
phoebe So how are things going with you?
paul Can't complain.
paul Come on.
rachel Okay.
paul Hey!
ross Hi!
paul Ross!
ross Great to see you!
paul Good to see you too!
ross How you doing?
paul Good. Bye!
ross Okay! You take care!
ross Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?
phoebe Yeah! That was so weird, huh?
ross Phoebe, why'd you do it?
phoebe I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!
ross What?! Why?!
phoebe Please, I think you know why.
ross I can't think of anything.
phoebe Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.
ross Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?
phoebe Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?
ross I guess it could.
phoebe Well then I think that's it.
ross Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.
phoebe Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.
paul Honey I made a reservation at China Garden, is that okay?
rachel Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.
paul It was fine.
rachel Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?
paul I'm thinking that you are looking really fine it that dress.
rachel Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.
paul Are you talking about having sex?
rachel No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!
paul Normal.
rachel Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.
paul Nope! That never happened to me!
rachel Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?
paul Nope.
rachel All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!
paul Okay.
rachel Okay.
paul Okay.
rachel All right.
paul When I was six years old.
rachel Hm-mmm.
paul I wanted a big wheel. And instead my parents got me this little plastic chicken that you hop around on. It was embarrassing; kids made fun of me. That was a pretty tough year.
rachel That's-that's great! See? I already feel like I know you a little better! Thank you. Okay, come on. Now we can go eat. Let's go.
paul It was horrible. They called me chicken boy.
rachel Oh!
paul And in fifth grade I got into a fight. Well, it wasn't really a fight. Richard Darinvel bit me on the nose and, and I feel down. I still have a little scare right here you can see it.
rachel Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?
paul Oh, I couldn't eat now.
rachel What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!
paul Chicken? Chicken boy!
rachel My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!
chandler Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.
phoebe Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.
chandler Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.
phoebe Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?
chandler Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?
phoebe Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.
male_jeweler Can I help you?
chandler Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.
phoebe Or not, whatever.
male_jeweler This ring is from the 1920s, it's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires on either side.
chandler Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?
male_jeweler Okay. Will you marry me?
chandler Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?
phoebe Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?
male_jeweler 8,600.
phoebe We will give you $10.
male_jeweler Are you interested in this ring?!
chandler Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.
male_jeweler Okay, I can let it go at eight.
phoebe We stand firm at $10.
male_jeweler How would you like to pay?
chandler Uh, credit card. Oh no! No-no, but I left my credit card with Joey. Okay, I'll go get it. You guard the ring.
phoebe Okay. Listen, I'm sorry about before. Do you have anything her for $10.
male_jeweler Uh yes, I have these two rather beautiful $5 bills.
phoebe I'll give you $1 for them.
ross Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?
joey No.
ross Remember? You-you were eating pizza.
joey Yeah.
ross Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.
joey Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!
ross Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.
joey Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.
gunther Here you go.
ross Oh.
joey Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.
ross All the time?
joey All the time!
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God!!
monica Still crying?
rachel Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!
monica Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.
rachel What's the other one?
monica I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.
rachel Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.
monica Oh, we have some
rachel No you don't!
phoebe Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?
male_jeweler A tad.
phoebe Okay. Then, take the tiara back and let me hold the musket again. Something's missing. It's not... Okay oh, let me see the ring my friend picked out.
male_jeweler Where's the 1920s princess cut ring.
female_jeweler I just sold it to that gentleman.
phoebe Oh my God!! No! What?! Help me! Let me out! Now!
paul Rachel?
chandler No. How are ya Paul?
paul Okay. Chandler, did your dad ever hug you?
chandler No, did he hug you?!
paul No! No! It's just that, my dad never did. I miss my dad.
chandler Well, you can see my dad in Vegas kissing other dads.
paul Hey Chandler?
chandler Yeah?
paul Would you.......Would you hug me?
chandler I'm a little busy here Paul.
paul That's exactly what my dad used to say!
chandler Okay, a quick one. Come on hug it out. Oh hey! There you go. Okay.
paul Five more seconds.
chandler Okay!
joey Hey!
paul Joey!
joey Whoa-whoa-hey-hey! Hi, Paul is it?
chandler Do you have my credit card?
joey Yes, it's in my... In...in my pocket. My back pocket! My back pocket!
chandler Thank God!
joey Oh hey listen I got us tickets to a Knicks game tonight.
chandler Oh, I can't go.
joey Come on! It'll be fun! Me, you, and Ross, and... Paul probably
phoebe Chandler, I found the perfect ring.
chandler Oh, that's uh, that's pretty nice but I'm gonna go with the one I picked first.
phoebe Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!
chandler What?
phoebe Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!
chandler They put you in jail?
phoebe The little jail between the doors!
chandler Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!
phoebe I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.
chandler Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.
phoebe Maybe it was the guy.
chandler It was the ring!
ross Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?
joey No! He blew us off!
ross What?!
joey I know!
ross I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.
joey Can I tell you something? Me too.
ross Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!
joey Ooooh! Freeze him out.
ross That's right!
joey I like it!
ross Eh? We'll show him!
joey From now on, it's gonna be Joey and Ross, best friends. Okay! We're gonna be the new Joey and Chandler.
rachel Hi. I'm back.
paul Hey! I have so much more to tell ya, I've written it all down!
rachel Ah that's great. No actually that's... That's great! That's really great! Y'know, I gotta tell ya writing, I mean writing, gets me uh, gets me kinda hot.
paul Wait! Wait! Listen! Listen to this! Y'know what I wanted to be when I was that age?
rachel A lover?
paul A surfer.
rachel Oh yeah surfer?
paul I wanted to be one with the waves, y'know?
rachel Okay, hold on real quick, hold on a second let me just uh, get a little more comfortable here. Wait, now wait a second, this isn't too revealing is it?
paul No. What ever happened to that little dude. So full of dreams
rachel I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!
paul What?! I can't believe you're trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!
rachel Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.
paul Oh Rachel, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to overwhelm you. It's just that, when those gates open, you... Hard to close 'em. But they are closed now. Believe me.
rachel I'm so glad, I'm so glad you shared. And I'm glad that you're done. What do you say we umm
paul I would really like that.
paul That was...so good.
phoebe Hey.
chandler I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!
phoebe It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!
chandler No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.
phoebe Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.
chandler I can't do that.
phoebe Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.
phoebe There he is!
chandler Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.
phoebe Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.
chandler Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.
phoebe Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.
customer Who is it?
phoebe It is your office.
customer Do you know who at my office?
phoebe John?
customer Oh John! Great!
phoebe Here he is.
chandler Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.
phoebe Wow! I would trade.
customer It is beautiful, but I'm gonna use this one. Now, if you'll excuse me.
chandler No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?
phoebe Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?
customer You're dying?!
chandler Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.
phoebe Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity
chandler Okay, that's enough honey!
customer I don't know. Let me see the ring.
chandler Great! Okay, here.
customer All right.
chandler Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! And you are about to marry a wonderful man! Hey! I'm marrying a dead woman!
chandler Guys? I've got something important to tell ya. Guys? Guys?! I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
joey I think we gotta end the freeze out.
ross Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?
chandler Yeah, check out the ring.
joey Oh my God!!
ross So you two are really serious?!
chandler Yep, pretty much.
ross You-you're gonna get married?! I mean... We're gonna be brothers-in-law!
joey And-and-and-and-and-and, and we're gonna be friends again!
chandler Heyyyy-What?
joey Oh it's water under the bridge, forget it!
chandler Okay! I was gonna wait 'til uh, it was official y'know? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because you're my best friends.
joey I think I'm gonna cry!
rachel Ugh! No more crying! Please! I just dumped one cry baby, I'll dump you too!
chandler I'm gonna ask Monica to marry me.
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh Chandler!! You guys are gonna be so happy!
chandler I know.
joey Where's all the tissues?!
chandler Check out the ring.
rachel Nice! One and a half carat easy.
phoebe Hi.
ross Hey-hey Pheebs!
phoebe What?
ross Chandler's gonna ask Monica to marry him!
phoebe Oh I know, I helped pick out the ring.
ross You told her before you told us?
chandler Well, she walked in when I was looking at the ring brochures. You can understand that, right? Guys? Guys?
