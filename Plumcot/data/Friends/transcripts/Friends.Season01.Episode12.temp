chandler No-no-no-no, we're done.
monica Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
joey Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
ross Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
phoebe Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
chandler And, we're done with the yogurt.
phoebe Sorry.
monica Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
joey Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
ross Hello!
joey How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
rachel Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
paolo Ah, poke a nose, mmm
joey_chandler_and_ross Mma, Mma, Mmaah
monica So, did I hear Poconos?
rachel Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
phoebe Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
monica Yeah, that's a big step.
rachel I know...
chandler Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
ross Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
rachel I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
ross ..nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
joey I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
chandler Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
joey Need a new table.
chandler You think?
carol Hey hey, come on in!
ross Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
carol Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
ross I'm pretty sure that it is...
carol So, I got the results of the amnio today.
ross Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
carol Totally and completely healthy!
ross Oh, that's great, that is great!
ross Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
carol Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
ross Of course it's your friend Tanya.
carol Don't you want to know about the sex?
ross The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
carol The sex of the baby, Ross.
ross Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
carol Do you want to know?
ross No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
susan Oh, hello Ross!
ross Susan...
susan So, so, did you hear?
ross Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
susan Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
carol Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
ross Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
susan Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
carol Mm-hmmm
ross Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
carol_and_susan It's a...
ross No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
carol Well, thanks for the books.
ross No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
susan All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
carol Hello?
ross Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
chandler Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
joey That's the rule.
chandler What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
joey How'd you get to that?
chandler Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
joey You knew about that?
chandler Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
joey Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
chandler What do you mean, like, buy it together?
joey Yeah
chandler You think we're ready for something like that?
joey Why not?
chandler Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
joey Why, are you moving out?
chandler I'm not moving out.
joey You'd tell me if you were moving out right
chandler Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
joey Aw, I know all about Kip!
chandler It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
joey Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
chandler Aw, don't do that
phoebes_assistant We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
phoebe Ok, thanks.
phoebes_assistant Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
paolo Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
phoebe Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
paolo Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
phoebe Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
phoebe Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
paolo Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
phoebe Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
rachel I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
monica And Monica knows...
ross Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
monica Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
joey So what's it gonna be?
ross Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
monica I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
joey Or an uncle...
joey_and_chandler Hey Phoebe!
ross Hi Pheebs!
rachel Pheebs!
phoebe Fine!
monica Phoebe, what's the matter?
phoebe Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
customer Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
rachel Oh, right, that's me!
joey Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
chandler Fine.
monica Phoebe, what is it?
phoebe All right, you know Paolo?
ross I'm familiar with his work, yes...
phoebe Well, he made a move on me.
joey Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
chandler More coffee over here, please!
monica Well, what happened?
phoebe Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
joey_and_chandler Ooooohh!
ross My God.
monica Are you sure?
phoebe Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
monica Was it...?
phoebe Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
guys Oooooo....
rachel "Ooo," what?
phoebe Uma Thurman.
monica Oh!
ross The actress!
ross Thanks Rach.
chandler So what are you gonna do?
ross You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
chandler Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
joey Feminist issue. That's where I went!
phoebe She is gonna hate me.
ross Yeah, well...
joey Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
chandler That's patio furniture!
joey So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
chandler What about the birds?
joey I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
chandler You pick one.
joey All right, how about the ladybugs?
chandler Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
joey Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
chandler Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hi Pheebs!
phoebe Are you moving out?
rachel No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
phoebe Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
rachel Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
phoebe Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
rachel Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
phoebe Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
rachel Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
phoebe Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
rachel All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
phoebe Which proves that I never lie.
rachel I guess you don't.
phoebe Paolo made a pass at me.
chandler So, what do you think?
ross I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
chandler I know!
monica So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
joey Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
monica Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
phoebe Are you okay?
rachel I need some milk.
phoebe Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
rachel No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
phoebe I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
rachel Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
rachel_and_phoebe I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
phoebe No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
rachel I don't know...right, he's the pig!
phoebe Such a pig!
rachel Oh, God, he's such a pig,
phoebe Oh he's like a...
rachel He's like a big disgusting...
phoebe ..like a...
rachel ..pig...pig man!
phoebe Yes, good! Ok...
rachel Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
phoebe Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
rachel Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
phoebe The end.
rachel Oh, God...
phoebe Should I not have told you?
rachel No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
phoebe I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
monica We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
ross Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
joey No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
ross Come on, two on one.
chandler What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
ross What, now?
joey Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
chandler My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
paolo No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
ross How's it going?
monica Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
phoebe Ooh!
paolo Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
phoebe Oh, ok bye-bye.
monica Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
paolo Grazie.
ross Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
phoebe Oh, just look at her...
ross Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
monica Oh, you're right.
ross ..and I really think it should be me.
ross Hey.
rachel Hey.
ross You all right?
rachel Ooh, I've been better...
ross Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
rachel Oh, Ross...
ross What?
rachel I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
ross Huh.
rachel Oh Ross, you're so great!
ross Ohhhh
monica Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
rachel Oh...
phoebe You ok?
rachel ..medium...hmm...any cookies left?
phoebe Yep!
ross See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
rachel No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
ross Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
rachel No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
ross What?
rachel What?
ross I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
rachel Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
ross Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
girls Yes, you're having a boy!
ross I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
chandler Wha-
joey Wha-
joey_and_chandler What is it?
ross I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
joey Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey_and_chandler We already knew that!
ross I'm having a son. Um...
monica Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
joey_and_chandler Shut-out!!
monica Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
joey Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
chandler Yeah, get out!
monica You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
chandler One more game?
joey Oh yeah!
