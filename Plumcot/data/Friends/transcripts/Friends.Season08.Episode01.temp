photographer Great. Great! Just give me a sec to change film.
monica Okay.
ross Okay, I know I'm not supposed to know, but I do. And I'm so excited for you!
joey What? What's going on?
ross Monica's pregnant!
joey Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!
monica Guys! I'm not pregnant.
joey Ah. Slow swimmers?
ross What?! What do you mean? You-you-you're not pregnant?
monica You didn't tell anybody I was did you?!
ross No! I'll be right back.
photographer Now why don't we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.
monica Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.
joey I can't! I-I don't have any other clothes here.
monica Find some! Please! Anything that doesn't say I-I died tragically in France.
photographer Well then why don't we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.
phoebe Okay. Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you weren't pregnant?
monica Because I'm not.
phoebe We found your test in the trash, if you're not pregnant--It's because I am.
chandler What?! What are you talking about?
monica What are you talking about?
phoebe Yes, I...I am with child. And I didn't want to say anything because it's your day; I didn't want to steal your thunder.
monica Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!
chandler Who's the father?
monica Yeah!
phoebe I can't say.
monica Why?!
chandler Why not?
phoebe I can't say because he's famous.
rachel Oh my God, who is it?!
monica Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.
phoebe Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.
chandler As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
phoebe What?! Well he never said that to me!
photographer Why don't we have Monica step away and we'll get Chandler and the bridemaids.
phoebe How about just the bridemaids?
chandler Y'know I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.
phoebe It is.
rachel For you.
phoebe Oh my God!
rachel Oh, thank you for doing that. I just can't deal with this just quite yet.
phoebe So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.
rachel You said that she was, I just didn't disagree with you.
phoebe Sneaky.
rachel Oh yeah.
photographer Smile ladies.
rachel Oh! Oh by the way?
phoebe Uh-hmm.
rachel James Brolin?
phoebe Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered he's gay.
rachel Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.
phoebe Really?!
bandleader Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!
chandler Before we go out there I've got a present for ya.
monica Honey, I'm going to put my hand in your pocket!
chandler No?
monica No.
chandler I've been taking dancing lessons.
monica What?!
chandler Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.
monica Oh that is so sweet!
chandler So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?
monica Yes.
monica What's the matter?
chandler I don't know, it's these new shoes, they're all slippery.
monica Well, are you going to be able to do this?
chandler Not well.
monica Well, the good news is, I don't think anyone's looking at us.
phoebe So, are you ready to talk about it?
rachel No.
phoebe Now?
rachel No!
phoebe Okay, we'll talk about something else then.
rachel Thank you.
phoebe Who's the father?!
rachel Ugh! Look honey y'know what? I haven't told him yet, so until I do I don't think I should tell anybody else.
phoebe Yeah. That's fine. That's fair. Is it Tag?
rachel Phoebe!!
phoebe Okay, I'm sorry. I'll stop.
rachel Okay.
phoebe Is it Ross? It's Ross isn't it-Oh my God, it's Joey!
rachel Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.
phoebe Ah-hah! At least we know it's a him.
monica Oh sweet Lord.
joey I'm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and it's either this or a bathrobe! Look, what's more important, the way I'm dressed or me being with you on your special day?
monica Honey, I'm not even going to pretend I was listening. Hey! Hey!
ross Hi. I'm uh, I'm Ross. I don't, I don't believe we've met. I'm Monica's older brother.
woman Oh hi, I'm, I'm Mona from her restaurant.
ross Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.
mona You think so? I've always kinda hated it.
ross Aw come on, Mona Lisa?
mona Uh-huh.
ross Mona umm...Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no she's uh-well she's dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.
mona Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.
ross Linda Clickclocken. So what uh, what-what table are you at? Oh, uh me too.
mona Oh good. Now there'll be someone there who likes my name.
ross Yes there will. Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert you've just been bumped up to table one. And if it's all right with you I'm gonna take your place at table six-Martin Clickclocken.
joey That's better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it.
mrs_bing Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. I'd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.
dennis_phillips Congratulations.
chandler Thank you.
mrs_bing Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.
chandler Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.
dennis_phillips Oh, I'm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.
mrs_bing Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.
joey I don't believe we've met, Joey Tribbiani.
dennis_phillips Dennis Phillips
joey Wow, I've admired your work for years. You-you've done some really amazing stuff.
dennis_phillips Oh, thank you. Well if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment.
joey Wow Dennis Phillips! That's great! How did you guys meet?
mrs_bing Well, it's a funny story.
chandler Funny: ha-ha or funny:
bandleader Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.
ross Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.
mona No, nine.
ross Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way which uh, which was misleading. Well I'm... Hello.
joey Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? 'Cause if I can get in a Broadway show then I would've done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.
chandler What size shoes do you wear?
joey Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.
chandler Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?
joey Uh, I don't even really know where I left those. Sorry.
chandler Those aren't eleven and a half.
joey Okay fine! I'm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, I'll show ya!
monica Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!
rachel Oh y'know what honey? Let's not talk about that right now?
monica This is so huge.
rachel Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?
monica Of course not nothing is. Between me and you
rachel Yeah.
monica ...in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?
rachel Hey! Y'know, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything they're supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!
monica How?
rachel I don't know! Maybe they have tools.
monica Well I-I talked to and uh, she's definitely going to have this baby. Y'know, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.
rachel Well, maybe that's, maybe that's really brave.
monica Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.
rachel Maybe she hasn't really thought it through that well.
monica Well, there's a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize she's not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?
rachel I don't know.
monica Are you okay?
rachel Uh-hmm. I'm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.
waiter Champagne?
rachel Oh yes! Thank you very much! Oh that's-that's actually how the French drink it.
phoebe Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolin
monica Oh really?!
phoebe Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin said
monica Rachel's really the one who's pregnant.
phoebe What?! Why bother?
monica How do you feel?
rachel I don't know. I don't know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I don't want to make. Somebody just take this away from me!!
phoebe Calm down. Maybe you're not pregnant.
rachel What?!
phoebe When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.
monica Yes! Maybe it's a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?
rachel How many ways are there to do that?
phoebe I'm-I'm just saying, don't freak out until you're a hundred percent sure.
rachel All right, I'll-I'll take it again when I get home.
monica You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.
rachel Okay. Thank you.
monica Okay.
phoebe I'll run out and get you one.
rachel Oh, you guys are so great.
monica Oh, wait a minute! Who's is the father?!
phoebe Oh no, she won't tell us.
monica Oh, come on it's my wedding! That can be my present.
rachel Wh-Hey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.
phoebe See? This is why you register.
ross It was the chair again! Okay? I'm not doing it! It what-look, I don't-y'know what-eh-eh... Hi.

little_girl Sure!
ross Yeah? Hop on. Is the pretty lady looking?
little_girl Uh-huh.

chandler And the world will never know.
joey Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?
chandler Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.
joey No-no! No! No! You don't tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks I'm a soap actor.
chandler But you're not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.
joey Hey!
little_girl Thank you.
ross No-no, thank you Miranda.
little_girl Melinda!
ross All right.
mona How cute was that?
ross Oh-oh, were you, were you watching?
second_girl Can I go next?
ross What? Of course you can! Hop on!
mona Okay, but I get to hop on after her.
ross I am so gonna score.
second_girl What?
ross I like your bow.
joey I'd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. And-and there was some sad memories. I'm sorry. And-and some scared memories-Whoa! Eh? And then, and then I realized I'll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. Oh! To the happy couple!
bandleader Thank you.
ross That was very nice Ashley.
ashley Can we do it again?
ross No-no.
mona So, is it my turn now?
fat_girl I'm next!
ross Oh!
mona Uh, that's okay. You can dance with her first.
ross Oh, you-you sure? Okay. Okay. So what's uh, what's your name.

dennis_phillips Oh my God, that was for my benefit?
joey Well, I'd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know you're casting for this new show
dennis_phillips Look umm Joey, I-I don't think you're quite right for this project.
joey Oh, see that's where you're wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didn't see it up there, just-just try me.
dennis_phillips It's an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?
joey Well I'm not proud of this, but
dennis_phillips Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Don't-don't-don't!
monica Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?
chandler Did it turn into sand?
monica Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, you'll be fine.
chandler No. No, I won't. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didn't want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.
monica Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesn't matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. Just try not to move your feet at all. There you go.
mr_geller Chandler, I'm gonna have you arrested.
chandler Why?
mr_geller You stole my moves.

mona No, I mean it. There are so few genuinely nice guys out there.
joey Tell me about it, I feel like I'm holding down the fort all by myself.
mona It's Joey right?
joey Yeah.
ross Wait a minute! No! I'm the nice one! I'm the one who danced with the kids all night! How...How small are your feet?!
