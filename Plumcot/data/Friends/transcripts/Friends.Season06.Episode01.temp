phoebe Hey! Don't you give me any of your-Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey Hey!
monica What are you guys doing here?
joey Ross and Rachel left us a message saying they were getting married! Isn't that why you guys are here?
chandler Yes! Well that-yes.
monica Why else would we be here?
joey Well! What happened?! Did we miss it?
chandler We actually missed it.
phoebe Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
monica This is insane!
phoebe What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
chandler What?!
phoebe Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
monica What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
phoebe Really?!
monica Yeah!
phoebe Oh my God!-Eh! Well
rachel Ohhh!
ross Why are we in bed together?
rachel I don't know. Do-do you have any clothes on?
ross Yeah.
rachel Really?!
ross No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
rachel Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
ross And we didn't have sex.
rachel Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
ross Tell me about it.
joey Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
phoebe Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
joey Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
phoebe What about my cab?
joey I don't need that anymore.
phoebe No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
joey I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
phoebe I don't know, it's such a long trip.
joey It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
phoebe Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
joey Sure?
phoebe All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
chandler Hi!
joey Hey.
monica Hey.
chandler So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
phoebe Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
joey Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
chandler It's a buffet man.
joey Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
chandler Listen, I gotta talk to you.
joey Sure! What's up?
chandler Monica and I almost got married last night.
joey Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
chandler Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
joey Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
chandler What?!
joey Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
monica How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
phoebe Well you don't.
monica Yes I do!
phoebe Good! Good! I was just testing you.
chandler Hi.
monica Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
phoebe No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
ross Hey!
the_girls Hey!
chandler Hey!
ross What?
chandler Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
rachel I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
ross Yeah!
phoebe Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
monica Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
rachel Who got married?!
chandler You did.
ross What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
rachel No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
ross We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
rachel Oh my God.
ross I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
rachel No!
joey They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
phoebe Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
monica What are you guys gonna do?
rachel Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
chandler Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
ross Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
joey An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
phoebe Oh-oh, that's your thing.
ross What?
phoebe You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
all Oh yeah!
ross No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
phoebe Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
monica So, what do you think we should do?
chandler I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
monica I know I love you!
chandler So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
monica That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
chandler Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
monica All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
chandler Sounds great.
monica Okay.
croupler Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
monica Ready?
chandler Ready!
monica Come on eight.
chandler Yes, yes eight.
croupler Eight! Easy eight.
monica Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
chandler That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
monica Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
chandler That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
monica I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
chandler Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
monica Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
phoebe Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
joey What?!
phoebe Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
joey All right. All right.
phoebe Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
joey Really? I don't
phoebe Sing!!
joey I wanna rock and roll all night!
joey Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
hitchhiker Morning!
ross Hey!
rachel Hey, hubby!
ross Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
rachel Uh-huh.
ross I'm not going to do that.
rachel Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
ross Yes, exactly!
rachel And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
ross Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
rachel Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
ross I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
rachel What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
ross Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
rachel Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
ross I'm asking you to do me a favor.
rachel You are asking me to be your wife!
ross And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
monica That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
chandler Well you did pull his hair.
monica He took my snack!
chandler I'm not getting into this again!
monica Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
chandler Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
monica This doesn't mean anything, does it?
chandler No!
monica Okay.
phoebe How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
joey Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
phoebe Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
hitchhiker No!
phoebe Do you like car games?
hitchhiker Yeah, y'know the license plate game?
phoebe I love the license plate game!
joey Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
phoebe No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
ross Hey!
rachel Hey!
ross Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
rachel No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
ross I don't know if it's true.
rachel Oh b-b-but it is!
ross Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
rachel Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
ross All right. All right, I'll do it.
rachel Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
hitchhiker Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
phoebe Oh, okay.
hitchhiker This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
phoebe And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
hitchhiker All right, see ya Pheebs.
joey Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
phoebe Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
joey Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
phoebe You can still sleep at night and stuff.
joey Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.
phoebe Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?
joey Yes.
phoebe Is it a meatball sub?
joey That is incredible! You are the master!
rachel Huh, that's funny. You look like you're gonna be the
monica No, don't say it! Don't even think it!
rachel All right. Okay Chandler, enjoy your handful.
chandler All right, should we just, should we just get married? Y'know? I mean should we just do it? All the signs are telling us to do it.
monica I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
chandler Me too!
monica I don't want things to change! Do you?
chandler No!
monica All right then, then nothing changes! Everything is great! Everything stays the same! And you go unpack because it's been three days and it's driving me insane!
chandler Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
chandler Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
monica Then all your stuff would be here.
chandler Well, what if all my stuff was here?
monica Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
chandler Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
monica Live together? There have been no signs for that.
chandler Me asking is kind of a sign.
