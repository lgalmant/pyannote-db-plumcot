rachel Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
monica Oh, I ordered mine first.
chandler Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
monica Give it to me.
chandler No.
monica Give it to me.
chandler Ok, you can have it.
monica There you go, enjoy your coffee.
chandler That was there when I got here.
phoebe Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
monica Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
phoebe Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
rachel You went out with a guy in the Navy?
phoebe Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
joey Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
phoebe No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
rachel So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
monica That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
ross Hiii.
joey Oh no, what happened?
ross Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
all Oh no.
ross Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
rachel Well I've had it.
joey Yeah, I've had it.
monica Had it.
chandler Had it.
phoebe Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
monica Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
richard Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
richard Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
monica Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
richard What're you doing?
monica Just waiting for you sweetie.
richard Are you remaking the bed?
monica I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
richard Then, you're redoing it because...
monica If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
richard You're pretty much running that risk either way.
monica Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
richard Oh, well that's not so crazy.
monica I'm just easing you in.
richard Oh, alright.
monica Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
richard Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
monica Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
chandler Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
joey But don't you need experience for a job like that?
chandler It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
scott Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
chandler Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
scott No kidding.
joey Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
scott Where do you work?
joey Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
chandler I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
scott Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
joey Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
rachel Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
monica You look fabulous honey, you really do.
phoebe Yeah? Are you sure, really.
rachel You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
phoebe I, I, I'm hideous.
monica It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
phoebe Come in.
ryan Hey baby, I'm back...
phoebe Hey Ryan, what's up?
ryan What's goin' on?
phoebe Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
ryan Chicken or small?
phoebe Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
ryan Why aren't you at home in bed?
phoebe 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
ryan I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
phoebe Ohh, ohh.
ryan If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
phoebe Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
ryan Can I please see your face?
phoebe Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
ryan Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
phoebe And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
ryan Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
phoebe I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
ryan Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
phoebe Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
joey Hey.
chandler Hey, how's the first day goin'?
joey Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
chandler Well there you go.
joey Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
chandler Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
joey Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
chandler Weird world. Your kids?
joey I figure my character has kids.
chandler Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
joey Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
chandler Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
joey Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
chandler Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
ryan You know what makes the itching even worse?
phoebe That you don't stop talking about it.
ryan Fine.
phoebe Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
ryan What're you doing? Are you scratching?
phoebe No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
ryan You're scratching. Give me the dice.
phoebe No.
ryan Give me the dice.
phoebe No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
ryan We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
phoebe Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
ryan No.
phoebe Give it.
ryan No.
phoebe Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
ryan Oh God help me.
phoebe Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
rachel Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
ross You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
joey You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
jeannie Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
joey Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
jeannie Bye bye Joey.
joey What a phony.
chandler Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
joey Sir.
mr_douglas Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
chandler Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
mr_douglas I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
joey Yeah Bing, what's that about?
chandler It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
mr_douglas Rough numbers?
joey This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
mr_douglas Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
chandler Uh, if you say so sir.
joey Joseph's good, isn't he?
chandler Well, I'm going to kill you.
joey Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
chandler Why?
joey Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
richard Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
monica This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
richard You're strict.
monica It's for their own good.
richard You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
monica Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
richard If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
monica Very good.
richard Thank you.
monica You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
richard You're gonna do what to my clocks.
monica I'm gonna set them to my time.
richard Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
monica No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
richard Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
monica No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
richard No come on. Come on tell me.
monica No. See you don't understand.
richard Come on.
monica No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
richard No that's not true. That is not true.
monica Oh yeah.
richard Yeah.
monica Alright, well tell me one of yours.
richard Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
monica What if they get mixed up?
richard Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
monica You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
richard See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
joey Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
chandler Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
joey 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
chandler Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
joey Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
chandler Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
joey What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
chandler I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
joey Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
chandler Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
joey Karen.
chandler Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
joey Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
chandler Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
joey Really?
chandler No freakshow, she's fictional.
joey Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
chandler Thank you.
joey It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
phoebe Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
rachel No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
ryan Well that wasn't easy.
ross Ok, dinner's on.
rachel And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
ross Alright you kids, bye now.
phoebe_and_ryan Bye.
ross Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
phoebe It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
ryan Wine?
phoebe Please.
ryan Oh, I spilled some.
phoebe I got it.
ryan I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
phoebe What?
ryan Sorry. You look beautiful.
phoebe Oh.
phoebe You know what, that's it, that's it.
richard Monica, wake up. Monica.
monica What's up?
richard I thought of a thing.
monica Yeah?
richard Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
monica No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
richard Or so I would have you believe.
monica No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
richard Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
monica Alright, go on.
richard Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
monica Oh my God, you're a freak.
richard Yeah. How 'bout that.
rachel So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
ryan I really can't say.
ross So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
ryan I can't say.
rachel Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
ryan I'm sorry, but I can't say.
ross Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
ryan I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.
phoebe Ok, I'll walk you out.
ross Bye Ryan.
ryan Pleasure.
rachel It was nice to meet you.
ryan Take care.
rachel So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?
ross You like that do ya?
rachel Oh yeah.
ross I'll make some calls.
rachel Ok.
ryan Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
phoebe I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
ryan Taxi.
phoebe Bye you.
rachel Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.
ross Is this what you had in mind?
rachel I'll say.
