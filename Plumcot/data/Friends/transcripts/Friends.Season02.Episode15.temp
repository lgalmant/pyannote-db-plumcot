monica Yes but my mom got me this job.
phoebe OK, I can be a waitress, I can be a waitress.
rachel Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.
monica Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing.

monica Sorry we're late.
dr_burke Ah, that's OK, come on in. Um, I'm sorry, is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.

dr_burke Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you. So, how ya been?
monica I've been great, just great. How have you been?
dr_burke Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.
monica The head tilt?
dr_burke Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt. 'How ya doin'? You OK?'
monica I'm sorry.
dr_burke No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob. 'I'm OK.' 'You sure?' 'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change.
monica Oh, that's too bad.
dr_burke I'll survive.
chandler Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.
joey What if we have to pee?
chandler I'll cancel the sodas.
monica You've got to get back out there, it's your party.
dr_burke But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.
monica You're an opthamologist.
dr_burke Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif.
phoebe That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there.
dr_burke See.
monica Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.
dr_burke OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. Who needs glasses?
phoebe You are so smitten.
monica I am not.
phoebe Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out.
monica Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.
phoebe So. You two are totally into each other.
monica Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.
phoebe OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?
monica Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.
phoebe Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?
monica Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age.
rachel C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. hard to follow.
ross I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
rachel I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.

rachel Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing.
ross I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big.
rachel OK.
ross OK, my hands were no where near your butt.
rachel I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there.
ross No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious.
rachel Just one cheek.
ross Nuh, uh, the moment's gone.
