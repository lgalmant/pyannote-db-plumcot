phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what are you doing shopping at eight in the morning?
rachel_green Well, I've been up since six. Thanks to somebody's dumb-ass rooster.

rachel_green Yeah! Especially not with all of these knives and cookbooks around
phoebe_buffay All right. I'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and um, see if I'm ready to have Frank and Alice's embryo transferred into my uterus.
dr_ross_geller Now, how will they know if you're ready?

monica_geller That is sooo not true!
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani She's mad because I know today's her laundry day and that means she's wearing her old lady underpants.
chandler_bing I can check that for ya.
monica_geller I just - I can't believe that you think that you and Chandler know me and Rachel better than we know you.
chandler_bing Well... we-we do. You can only eat Tic Tacks in even numbers.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, what's that about?
chandler_bing And you... Ross, I believe, if you check Rachel's bag you will find a half-eaten box of cookies in there.
dr_ross_geller You're good. These are not.

joey_tribbiani Serious?
monica_geller Are you scared?
joey_tribbiani No! All right, who-who makes up the questions?
monica_geller Ross will do it.
dr_ross_geller Oh sure, "Ross will do it!" It's not like he has a job, or a child, or a life of his own.
rachel_green Fine! We'll ask Phoebe.
dr_ross_geller No-no-no, I-I wanna play.
dr_zane It looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.
phoebe_buffay Oh! I knew it! I knew it! I felt really thick this morning.

dr_zane Okay, it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.
phoebe_buffay Embryossss? As in, "More than one?"
dr_zane Um-hmm, five actually.
phoebe_buffay Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?
dr_zane We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.
phoebe_buffay That's it! 25 percent? That means that's it's like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!
frank_buffay_jr Hey, y'know I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?
alice_knight_buffay Sweety, now, she's a woman, not a gumball machine.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well y'know what, don't worry you guys, 'cause I'm-I'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.
frank_buffay_jr Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.
alice_knight_buffay Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, we're kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.
phoebe_buffay Whoa!! That - okay, that's a lot of pressure on me and my uterus. So, well okay, so is there - is maybe is there something that I can do y'know just to like help make sure I get pregnant?
dr_zane No, I'm sorry.
phoebe_buffay Wow! You guys really don't know anything!
frank_buffay_jr I know! Why don't you get drunk! That worked for a lot of girls in my high school.
monica_geller You guys! Do you realize that any minute now, Phoebe can be pregnant?
