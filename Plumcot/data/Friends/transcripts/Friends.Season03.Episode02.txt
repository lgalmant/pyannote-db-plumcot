joey_tribbiani All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider.
chandler_bing Taste it.
joey_tribbiani Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!
chandler_bing Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey, mister tux!
dr_ross_geller Why aren't you guys dressed?
joey_tribbiani We have a half hour.
dr_ross_geller No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight.
joey_tribbiani Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed.
dr_ross_geller Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now.
rachel_green Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy.
dr_ross_geller Really.
rachel_green Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green How come you didn't come over earlier?
dr_ross_geller 'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Ross, want some cider?
dr_ross_geller No. So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done.
rachel_green Yeah, I just have to get dressed.
dr_ross_geller Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
rachel_green Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing.
joey_tribbiani Glass of fat?
joey_tribbiani What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
dr_ross_geller No! Do you wanna hear it?
joey_tribbiani Am I in it?
dr_ross_geller Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey.
phoebe_buffay Hello.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Whoa!
dr_ross_geller Wow, hello! You look great!
phoebe_buffay Thank you! I know, though.
dr_ross_geller You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny.
chandler_bing All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men. Get up.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing You're in my seat.
joey_tribbiani How is this your seat?
chandler_bing 'Cause I was sitting there.
joey_tribbiani But then you left.
chandler_bing Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back.
joey_tribbiani What's the big deal, sit somewhere else.
chandler_bing The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat.
joey_tribbiani Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo...
dr_ross_geller You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So..
chandler_bing All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal. GET UP!!
monica_geller Hi.
monica_geller Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!
phoebe_buffay All right all ready.
monica_geller Ooh, are you gonna do magic?
dr_ross_geller That's, that's funny. Change!
monica_geller Hang on a second I just got in.
dr_ross_geller Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late.
phoebe_buffay We could not, would not want to wait.
dr_ross_geller Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.
monica_geller Has somebody been drinking my fat?
rachel_green You guys, does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, you might be the first one.
monica_geller Rach, did you check the machine?
rachel_green Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind.
chandler_bing Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called
joey_tribbiani All right! You can have the chair.
chandler_bing Really!
joey_tribbiani Oh my, would you look at that!
phoebe_buffay "Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?" Is that too spooky?
dr_ross_geller "Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Nevermind.
monica_geller Is-is-is that message old or new? Old or new?! Old or new?!
dr_ross_geller It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?
monica_geller What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?
chandler_bing Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?
monica_geller Huh?
dr_ross_geller I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay. There we go, there we go.
chandler_bing You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here. Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad!
phoebe_buffay Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
joey_tribbiani I'm so sorry.
phoebe_buffay What am I gonna do?
dr_ross_geller No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't! What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!
phoebe_buffay Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus.
monica_geller If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?
phoebe_buffay Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that.
chandler_bing Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
monica_geller So, should I call him back?
chandler_bing All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair. I'm soooo, comfortable.
joey_tribbiani Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.
chandler_bing All right!
dr_ross_geller Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay.
chandler_bing All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair!
rachel_green Is this a little too... Pheebs, what happened?
phoebe_buffay Hummus. I got the hummus.
rachel_green Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?
phoebe_buffay That won't go with this dress though.
rachel_green No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes.
rachel_green Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?
monica_geller I called him.
monica_geller Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?
phoebe_buffay Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place.
monica_geller Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough.
joey_tribbiani Monica, how are you gonna do that?
monica_geller I know the code to his answering machine.
dr_ross_geller Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing.
machine#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode02 "You have two new messages."
joey_tribbiani Wow, what a cool job. 'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'
monica_geller "Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."
joey_tribbiani Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy.
joey_tribbiani Now she sounded breezy.
monica_geller He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
phoebe_buffay Monica, you don't know that.
monica_geller Well, who's voice was that?
chandler_bing Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's.
monica_geller Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?
dr_ross_geller Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab.
monica_geller It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
rachel_green Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!
dr_ross_geller You don't, you don't know what your wearing?
rachel_green Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you.
chandler_bing All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, "Get out of my chair, dillhole!"
joey_tribbiani Okay.
chandler_bing What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions.
chandler_bing The cushions are the essence of the chair!
joey_tribbiani That's right! I'm taking the essence.
chandler_bing Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room.
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty.
rachel_green Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep.
dr_ross_geller Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.
rachel_green Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days.
phoebe_buffay Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me!
rachel_green Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight.
phoebe_buffay Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!
dr_ross_geller Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?
rachel_green No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you.
chandler_bing We used them as pillows when we went camping.
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing The sheep.
dr_ross_geller Hey, what you do on your own time...
joey_tribbiani Where's my underwear?!
dr_ross_geller Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?
chandler_bing He took my essence!
dr_ross_geller Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?
joey_tribbiani Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now.
dr_ross_geller Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?
joey_tribbiani It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
chandler_bing Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions.
joey_tribbiani Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.
chandler_bing What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?
joey_tribbiani Hey, opposite, is opposite!
chandler_bing He's got nothing!
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm ready.
phoebe_buffay Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'
chandler_bing What are you supporting?
phoebe_buffay Duh!! Christmas!
dr_ross_geller Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch. Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more. What time is it? It's 7
rachel_green Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?
dr_ross_geller Just, just, just pick one!
phoebe_buffay Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?
rachel_green Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay.
rachel_green But I...
dr_ross_geller No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go.
rachel_green All right.
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
monica_geller Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to.
dr_ross_geller It was, it was her voice.
chandler_bing Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place.
monica_geller Okay. That was her right?
phoebe_buffay Definitely.
monica_geller See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now.
dr_ross_geller Yay!
phoebe_buffay I'll get it, okay. Hi, Monica and Rachel's. Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling. Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that.
monica_geller Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that....
chandler_bing You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?
monica_geller Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!! That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back.
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick.
monica_geller Okay, fine.
chandler_bing They got a phone in there, right?
phoebe_buffay Okay, we're on it. We're on it.
dr_ross_geller Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um.
rachel_green I'm not gonna gooo.
dr_ross_geller You're not going to go.
rachel_green No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.
dr_ross_geller How, how, um how can you not be going?
rachel_green I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going.
dr_ross_geller Um, you know, just out of curiosity...
rachel_green Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood.
dr_ross_geller Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled.
rachel_green It's fine.
dr_ross_geller No, but, your-your mad.
rachel_green I'm not mad.
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green I'm just not going.
dr_ross_geller Your not going.
rachel_green Right.
dr_ross_geller Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
rachel_green Um, hum.
dr_ross_geller Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
rachel_green No.
dr_ross_geller No, because your not upset.
rachel_green Right.
dr_ross_geller About the yelling.
rachel_green Right, and the humiliating.
dr_ross_geller Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay.
rachel_green Um, hum.
dr_ross_geller We're good.
rachel_green Right.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Honey?
rachel_green Yes, Ross.
dr_ross_geller I love you.
phoebe_buffay Get away from that! No! She's just getting dressed.
chandler_bing Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
joey_tribbiani Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own.
chandler_bing Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
joey_tribbiani Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
chandler_bing Oooo-ooh!
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!
chandler_bing Jeez, what a baby.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.
dr_ross_geller You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there.
joey_tribbiani You could drink the fat.
dr_ross_geller Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation.
rachel_green No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I think you should drink the fat.
joey_tribbiani Yaaaay!
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do.
phoebe_buffay Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out.
dr_ross_geller I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers.
rachel_green No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!
dr_ross_geller You will?!
rachel_green You were really gonna do that, weren't you?
dr_ross_geller Well, yeah.
rachel_green You were gonna drink the fat.
joey_tribbiani Let's see what else he'll do!
dr_ross_geller How 'bout instead you, go get changed! You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!
chandler_bing Stop it. Stop it!
phoebe_buffay Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!

dr_ross_geller Wow! What a pleasure.
sherman_whitfield Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written.
chandler_bing Excuse me. Hi.
sherman_whitfield Yes?
chandler_bing Well, your kind of sitting in my seat.
sherman_whitfield What do you mean, your seat?
chandler_bing I mean, I was sitting there.
