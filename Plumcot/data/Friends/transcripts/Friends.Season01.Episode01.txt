monica_geller There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
joey_tribbiani C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
chandler_bing All right Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
phoebe_buffay Wait, does he eat chalk?
phoebe_buffay Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
monica_geller Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
chandler_bing Sounds like a date to me.
chandler_bing Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
all@ Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
chandler_bing Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
joey_tribbiani Instead of...?
chandler_bing That's right.
joey_tribbiani Never had that dream.
phoebe_buffay No.
chandler_bing All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
monica_geller And they weren't looking at you before?!
chandler_bing Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
joey_tribbiani This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
monica_geller Are you okay, sweetie?
dr_ross_geller I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
chandler_bing Cookie?
monica_geller Carol moved her stuff out today.
joey_tribbiani Ohh.
monica_geller Let me get you some coffee.
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
phoebe_buffay Ooh! Oh!
dr_ross_geller No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
phoebe_buffay Fine! Be murky!
dr_ross_geller I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
monica_geller No you don't.
dr_ross_geller No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
joey_tribbiani And you never knew she was a lesbian...
dr_ross_geller No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
chandler_bing Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
dr_ross_geller I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
monica_geller Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what? A wrong number?
dr_ross_geller Sorry.
joey_tribbiani Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
joey_tribbiani Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
dr_ross_geller I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
chandler_bing And I just want a million dollars!
monica_geller Rachel?!
rachel_green Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
waitress#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode01 Can I get you some coffee?
monica_geller De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
rachel_green Hi, sure!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
monica_geller So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
rachel_green Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
monica_geller Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
monica_geller Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
chandler_bing Tuna or egg salad? Decide!
dr_ross_geller I'll have whatever Christine is having.
rachel_green Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
phoebe_buffay If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
chandler_bing Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
joey_tribbiani I say push her down the stairs.
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani@phoebe_buffay Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!
rachel_green C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
dr_ross_geller You can see where he'd have trouble.
rachel_green Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
monica_geller Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
rachel_green Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
monica_geller Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
phoebe_buffay Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...
rachel_green I'm all better now.
phoebe_buffay I helped!
monica_geller Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.
joey_tribbiani And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
monica_geller Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
joey_tribbiani What, like there's a rule or something?
chandler_bing Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
paul It's, uh, it's Paul.
monica_geller Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!
joey_tribbiani Who's Paul?
dr_ross_geller Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
monica_geller Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
dr_ross_geller He finally asked you out?
monica_geller Yes!
chandler_bing Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
monica_geller Rach, wait, I can cancel...
rachel_green Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
monica_geller Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
dr_ross_geller That'd be good...
monica_geller Really?
dr_ross_geller No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
phoebe_buffay What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
monica_geller Hi, come in! Paul, this is.... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
all@ Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
monica_geller Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
dr_ross_geller A wandering?
monica_geller Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Paul!
paul Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
monica_geller Shut up, Joey!
dr_ross_geller So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
rachel_green Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
dr_ross_geller Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
chandler_bing Yes, and we're very excited about it.
rachel_green Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.
dr_ross_geller Okay, sure.
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
phoebe_buffay Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
dr_ross_geller I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
joey_tribbiani I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
chandler_bing It's a beautiful thing.
joey_tribbiani What's this?
chandler_bing I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
joey_tribbiani Which goes where?
chandler_bing I have no idea.
joey_tribbiani Done with the bookcase!
chandler_bing All finished!
dr_ross_geller This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
chandler_bing Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
joey_tribbiani Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
dr_ross_geller You guys.
chandler_bing Oh, God.
joey_tribbiani You got screwed.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller Oh my God!
paul I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
monica_geller My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
paul Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
monica_geller -leg?
paul That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
monica_geller You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
paul Ooh, steer clear of you.
rachel_green Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
dr_ross_geller I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
joey_tribbiani Shut up!
chandler_bing You must stop!
dr_ross_geller That only took me an hour.
chandler_bing Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!
dr_ross_geller You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
joey_tribbiani What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
dr_ross_geller I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
paul Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
monica_geller What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
paul No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
monica_geller Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
paul Isn't there?
monica_geller Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
paul Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform..Sexually.
monica_geller Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
paul It's okay...
monica_geller I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
paul Two years.
monica_geller Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
paul So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
monica_geller ..Yeah. Yeah, I do.
priest_on_tv#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode01 We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
rachel_green Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
dr_ross_geller Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
joey_tribbiani Great story! But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea... Oh man,
chandler_bing Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
joey_tribbiani Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
rachel_green Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
chandler_bing That is amazing.
joey_tribbiani Congratulations.
rachel_green Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
chandler_bing If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
joey_tribbiani Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
monica_geller Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
all@ Morning. Good morning.
paul Morning.
joey_tribbiani Morning, Paul.
rachel_green Hello, Paul.
chandler_bing Hi, Paul, is it?
paul Thank you! Thank you so much!
monica_geller Stop!
paul No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
monica_geller We'll talk later.
paul Yeah. Thank you.
joey_tribbiani That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
monica_geller Shut up, and put my table back.
all@ Okayyy!
chandler_bing All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
rachel_green So, like, you guys all have jobs?
monica_geller Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I'm an actor.
rachel_green Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
joey_tribbiani I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
monica_geller Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
joey_tribbiani Look, it was a job all right?
chandler_bing 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
joey_tribbiani I will not take this abuse.
chandler_bing You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
joey_tribbiani You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler?
monica_geller So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
rachel_green I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
monica_geller I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
rachel_green Oh, yeah.
monica_geller Well, it's like that. With feelings.
rachel_green Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
monica_geller Big time!
rachel_green Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.
monica_geller I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
rachel_green Oh, look, wish me luck!
monica_geller What for?
rachel_green I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
franny Hey, Monica!
monica_geller Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
franny You had sex, didn't you?
monica_geller How do you do that?
franny Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who?
monica_geller You know Paul?
franny Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
monica_geller You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
franny Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
joey_tribbiani Of course it was a line!
monica_geller Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
dr_ross_geller I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
monica_geller I hate men! I hate men!
phoebe_buffay Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
monica_geller Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
phoebe_buffay All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
monica_geller I just thought he was nice, y'know?
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
rachel_green Guess what?
dr_ross_geller You got a job?
rachel_green Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
chandler_bing And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
rachel_green You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
chandler_bing Oh, how well you know me...
rachel_green They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
monica_geller How'd you pay for them?
rachel_green Uh, credit card.
monica_geller And who pays for that?
rachel_green Um... my... father.
rachel_green Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
monica_geller C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
rachel_green I know that. That's why I was getting married.
phoebe_buffay Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
rachel_green Thank you.
phoebe_buffay You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
dr_ross_geller The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
monica_geller All right, you ready?
rachel_green No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? "Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?" Come on, I can't do this!
monica_geller You can, I know you can!
rachel_green I don't think so.
dr_ross_geller Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything!
dr_ross_geller C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
all@ Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
rachel_green Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
monica_geller Rachel! That was a library card!
all@ Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
chandler_bing Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
monica_geller Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
monica_geller Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
dr_ross_geller No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
monica_geller You be okay?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
monica_geller That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Goodnight.
dr_ross_geller Mmm. Oh, no-
rachel_green Sorry-
dr_ross_geller No no no, go-
rachel_green No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
dr_ross_geller Split it?
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
rachel_green I knew.
dr_ross_geller You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
rachel_green I did.
dr_ross_geller Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
rachel_green Yeah, maybe...
dr_ross_geller Okay... okay, maybe I will...
rachel_green Goodnight.
dr_ross_geller Goodnight.
monica_geller See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
dr_ross_geller I just grabbed a spoon.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
phoebe_buffay I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
monica_geller What? I-I said you had a-
phoebe_buffay What I said you had...
monica_geller Would you stop?
phoebe_buffay Oh, was I doing it again?
all@ Yes!
monica_geller I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
joey_tribbiani Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
dr_ross_geller There's an image.
rachel_green Would anybody like more coffee?
chandler_bing Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
rachel_green I'm just serving it.
all@ Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
chandler_bing Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
customer#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode01 Ahh, miss? More coffee?
rachel_green Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.
chandler_bing Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
