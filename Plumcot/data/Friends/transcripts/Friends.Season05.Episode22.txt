chandler_bing You got the lead in a movie? That's amazing! What's the movie about?!
joey_tribbiani It's called Shutter Speed, it's really cool! Yeah, umm, I meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in like a day, right? And then, she disappears... But I find out where she lives and when I get there this like old lady answers the door and I say, "Where's Betsy?" Right? And she says, "Betsy's been dead for 10 years."

phoebe_buffay Yeah, I've been around.
joey_tribbiani Okay, so-so which route should I take the northern route or the southern route?
phoebe_buffay Ooh, if you take the northern route there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees. {Okay, I must protest this, I've lived in Illinois all my life and know of no man with a beard of bees! Wisconsin, on the other hand, might be a different story.}
joey_tribbiani Great! Problem solved!
phoebe_buffay But on the southern route there's a chicken that plays tic-tac-toe.
joey_tribbiani Well, back to square one.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I know a way that you can decide! All right, I'm going to ask you a series of questions and you answer as quickly as you can.
joey_tribbiani Yes!

rachel_green Oh my God! What does that thing do?
monica_geller Oh that's an eye removal machine.
rachel_green All right, I'm outta here!

rachel_green Okay.
dr_miller That's okay.
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Okay. Okay!
dr_miller 1...2! Y'know what? You're young; you probably don't have glaucoma.
rachel_green Great!! It was very, very nice to meet you sir--Ow! Hey! What are you doing?! Are you crazy!
dr_miller Okay. You've got a small, minor infection in that left eye. I want you to take these drops three times a day and you'll be as good as new.
rachel_green Yeah, no, I don't-I don't put things in my eye.
dr_miller Okay then, I guess we'll see you back here in three months.
rachel_green Great!
dr_miller And I'll fit you for a glass eye.
rachel_green Okay, just give me the damn drops!
monica_geller Dr. Miller? P E C F D.
dr_miller Very good Monica! You know where they are.
monica_geller I sure do! And you don't get one!
rachel_green Y'know, I-I gotta tell ya, those eye drops are a miracle. My eye is a 100% better.
monica_geller They're still in my coat.
rachel_green Damn!
chandler_bing Hey!

chandler_bing Yeah, listen, how cold is it going to be there? Do I need a coat or will all these sweater vests be enough?
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller I love you.
joey_tribbiani Man, I wish Ross was coming with us! Y'know? I'm gonna miss him!
phoebe_buffay Thanks a lot! I just got that jerk out of my mind!
chandler_bing Hey, so where are we staying? Is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?
joey_tribbiani Uh no, not really. It's an independent film y'know? So we don't have a real big budget. I figured I'd just stay in your room.
chandler_bing I see, but once you get your first paycheck you'll be springing a big hotel suite, right? I mean, lead in a movie, they must be paying you a lot?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah! For every dollar Shutter Speed makes, one penny of it goes right in Joey's pocket.
chandler_bing So you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?
joey_tribbiani Did you not hear the plot of the movie? "She's been dead for ten years." I'm gonna be a millionaire!

chandler_bing I don't know.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, hey, I know how we can decide! All right, uh, I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions and then you have to answer real fast. Okay? So uh, clear your mind Clear it right out! Clear it out! Clear!
chandler_bing Okay!
joey_tribbiani Okay, uhh, would you rather be too wet or too dry?
chandler_bing Too dry.

joey_tribbiani Y'know what? I don't need this! Okay? I don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.
chandler_bing Joe, I don't think this is going to be your big break.
joey_tribbiani Is that why you're on this trip, huh? Make me feel like a loser? 'Cause if it is, I'll tell ya, I-I-I'd rather be alone.
chandler_bing Oh, you don't want me on the trip?
joey_tribbiani Not if you're gonna be like this!
chandler_bing All right, I'll tell ya what, the next time you ask me a question like that I'll lie.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! I don't want you on the trip!
chandler_bing All right, fine! Fine! Why don't you pull over? I'll get out right now!
joey_tribbiani Fine! Get out!
chandler_bing You're not actually supposed to stop on the bridge.
joey_tribbiani Get out!!
chandler_bing All right!! Wait! Wait, there's no sidewalk! Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
dr_ross_geller Okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?
phoebe_buffay No.
dr_ross_geller Are you angry at me because I said your handwriting is childlike?
phoebe_buffay No that made me feel precious.

all@ Why?!
chandler_bing I don't know! He went crazy! Y'know, we were playing that game where you-you ask a question and you answer it really fast.
phoebe_buffay That game should not be played without my supervision.
chandler_bing Well, I don't know what mad him so mad, y'know? All I said was that uh, I didn't think this wasn't gonna be his big break, that this movie wasn't going to do anything for him, and that uh, y'know it didn't sound like a real movie--Okay, he should've pushed me off of the bridge.
phoebe_buffay What's in the bag?
chandler_bing Oh, I figured you guys would all be mad at me. So I got you some gifts that I found on the side of the road. Who wants the teddy bear with one leg?
phoebe_buffay I do!

monica_geller Not even close.
rachel_green Okay, then y'know what? Help me! I need help! I can't do this!

rachel_green Wow, y'know if Joey and Chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune!
phoebe_buffay Ooh that is definitely Chandler, Joey, or Ross. Or-or Rachel!
monica_geller Hello? It's Joey. I'm so glad you called! Chandler told me what happened. Y'know he's really upset about it.
joey_tribbiani Not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what I did with his sweater vests!
monica_geller What did you do to his sweater vests?
joey_tribbiani Let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in Ohio. Hey Monica listen is-is Phoebe there? I gotta ask her something about the car.
monica_geller Yeah, she's here. Hold on a second.
phoebe_buffay Hey, dude!
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs! Listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat. What-what is it?
phoebe_buffay Oh that's my grandma. And thanks Joey she's having a really great time.
chandler_bing Is that Joey? Is that Joey? Let me talk to him! I wanna talk to him!
phoebe_buffay Okay Joey? Chandler's here, he was wondering... Okay, I guess he ran out of change.
chandler_bing Y'know, he won't even talk to me. How am I going to apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?
monica_geller Well, maybe you should send him something. So that when he gets to Las Vegas he'll know that you're sorry.
chandler_bing That's a good idea. I wonder where I could get a basket of porn
phoebe_buffay No, don't-don't say I'm sorry with porn!
chandler_bing Really?
phoebe_buffay Y'know what you should send him? A cartoon of cigarettes. 'Cause that why he could trade it for protection. No. That's prison.
dr_ross_geller Okay Pheebs, I know how we're going to figure this out. Okay, clear your mind and answer the first thing that comes into your head. Okay?
phoebe_buffay Uh-hmm.

dr_ross_geller When did I say you were boring?!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, I remember now! We were playing chess!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe! You and I have never played chess!
phoebe_buffay Oh, come on! Yes, remember that time on the frozen lake? We were playing chess, you said I was boring, and then you took off your energy mask and you were Cameron Diaz! Okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.
