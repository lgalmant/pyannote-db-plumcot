ross Listen, I-I need a favor. Umm, I was in the shower, and as I was cleansing myself, I ah, I-I, well I felt something.
chandler Was it like a sneeze only better?
ross No, no, I mean, I mean a thing on my body.
joey What was it?
ross Well, I don't know, it's-it's kinda in a place that's not... It's not visually accessible to me, and I was hoping maybe you guys could-could help me out.
chandler_and_joey Whoa!!!
chandler No!!
ross Come on you guys, it's no big deal!
chandler Whoa-heeeiiiiii-iiiii-ah!! Huh.
ross Well what is it? Is it a mole?
joey No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.
ross Well, eww. What? Is it a pimple?
chandler No, it's... fancier than a pimple. Look Ross, why don't you just go see a
rachel Hey guys! What's...
chandler Okay, well, it's definite, two more weeks of winter.

phoebe Yeah, and these are my friends. People. This is Vince, Vince the people.
rachel Hi!
chandler Hey!
vince Hey!
phoebe Vince is a fireman.
rachel Wow! Have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?
vince 98 hot saves, highest in the force.
chandler Well, y'know if Joey and I played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred.
vince Fire safety is not a joke, son.
chandler You're right, I know.
vince Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight. See you Saturday.
phoebe Okay.
rachel Wow, he's cute, Pheebs! But I thought you just started dating that Kindergarten teacher.
phoebe Oh, Jason? Yeah, uh-huh, we're seeing each other tonight.
rachel What-Pheebs?! Two dates in one day? That's so unlike you.
phoebe I know, I know! I'm like playing the field. Y'know? Like, juggling two guys, I'm sowing my wild oats. Y'know? Y'know, this kind've like y'know oat-sowin', field-playin' juggler.
joey So Pheebs, do they know about each other?
phoebe Does a dog's lips move when he reads? Okay, no they don't.
ross Hey guys!
joey Hey.
rachel Hi!
joey Well?!
chandler Okay, how'd it go at the doctor's?
ross Well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about, it's totally benign.
joey Well what is it?!
ross He couldn't even tell me! He said it was just some sort of skin... abnormality. And the worst thing is he-he-he said, he said, without being able to identify it, he was reluctant to remove it.
chandler Y'know what? You should go to my guy, because when I went in there with my third nipple. He just lopped it right off. Y'know? So I guess I'm lucky. I mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples.
ross At least they knew what yours was. Y'know, yours had a name.
joey Oh! Maybe they'll name yours after you! Y'know, they'll call it, The Ross. And then people would be like, "Awww, he's got a Ross."
ross Yeah, that'd be cool!
monica Pete's breaking up with me.
all What?!
monica I just checked my messages, and he said that when he gets back from Atlanta, we need to talk.
rachel And?
monica Well that's it. People never say `We need to talk' unless it's something bad.
joey Whoa, that doesn't necessarily mean that he's breaking up with you.
monica Really?!
joey Yeah, maybe he just cheated on you.
jason ..and I know I'll never miss doing it, but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool knowing that you're making a difference in a kid's life.
phoebe That is so great! Oh, I... Oh my God!
jason Whoa!
phoebe Oh my God!!!
jason Ahh-ahh, we'd better call the fire department!
phoebe No! No!
jason No, no?
phoebe Well, we don't n-n-n-n-need a fireman, we'd, we'd like a good mechanic. Oh my God, here they come! Well, we gotta get out of here!
jason W-w-w-wait! Why?!
phoebe Well look, if I wanted to see a fireman, I would date one. Okay?
ross Th-th-that's all it is, a third nipple. Y'know? Just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. Y'know? You can take it off. Just slice that baby right off!
dr_rhodes Take your shirt off, and let's see what we're dealing with here. What are you doing?
ross Just showing you my run-of-the-mill-slice-it-right-off third nipple.
dr_rhodes Well that's not a third nipple.
ross No?
dr_rhodes First of all, it's on your ass.
ross Well then, what is it?!
dr_rhodes Wait a minute, hold it. Johnson! Will you come in here a moment?
dr_johnson I'm with Hamilton!
dr_rhodes He's good with rear things, bring him in too.
monica I gotta go water Pete's plants. Y'know what, if he's gonna break up with me, maybe I won't water his plants.
chandler Well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe Joey and I should water his plants. If y'know what I mean.
joey Or ha-ha, we could go over there and pee on them.
phoebe ...and I-I can't take it! Y'know? I'm just, always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other one. It's making me crazy.
rachel Well honey, then why don't you break up with one of them?
phoebe Uh.
joey Whoa-whoa-whoa. What ah, what happened to playing the field?
phoebe Well, it just, it doesn't feel like playing anymore, it feels like work. It's like I'm working in the field.
rachel So Pheebs, pick one of them.
monica Yeah. Which one do you like more?
phoebe Well, Vince is great, y'know `cause, he's like a guy, guy. Y'know? He's so burly, he's sooo very burly.
joey Okay, good, so there you go. Go with Vince.
phoebe Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.
chandler Well sensitive is important, pick him.
phoebe Yeah.
joey Oh sure, go with the sissy.
phoebe Jason is not a sissy!
joey Oh no-no-no-no, I meant Chandler.
ross Y'know I have dinner plans!!
dr_rhodes Thank you soo much for coming on such a short notice. Ladies and gentlemen, I've-I've-I've been practicing medicine for twenty-three years, and I'm stumped.
all Whoa.
monica Okay, this is the den. All right, check this out. Lights! Whoa! All right. Less lights! Bad lights! Lights go away! Oh, see you just need to find the right command.
ross Yes, and the dimmer switch.
joey Whoa! For a rich guy he's got, that's a pretty small TV.
monica No-no-no, that's a video-phone. But hey guys you're not supposed to be here, so please, do not touch anything.
chandler I-kea! This is comfortable.
rachel This place is amazing.
phoebe God, that is the nicest kitchen.

joey Hi, how ya doing?
monica Ahh, Pete, the other day when you said you needed to talk, umm, just so I know, is it good news or bad news.
pete Oh, it's good news. No, it's definitely good news. Hold on a second, I have another call. Hey, how's it going?
monica Oh no-no-no, it's still me.

monica Okay. Well, it's good news. It's good news.
chandler So, what do you thing the good news is?
joey Wow! Look at this! He wrote a check for 50,000 dollars to Hugo Ligrens Ring Design. Oh, sorry, what do you think the good news is?
monica Oh my.
rachel Monica's gonna marry a millionaire!!!
ross Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone. Call Mom! Call Mom!
petes_mom Hello.
monica And that's Pete's Mom.
rachel Mon you definitely have to make it a theme wedding, and the theme could be, "Look how much money we've got!" Y'know, I mean you could put, you could put money in-in the invitations! You-you could have like little money place settings. And ah, you could start with a money salad! I mean it'll be dry, but people will like it.
monica Would you stop? We've only been going out a couple of weeks, I mean we don't even know if he's gonna propose.
chandler Yes, but this is Pete. Okay? He's not like other people, on your first date he took you to Rome. For most guys that's like a third or fourth date kinda thing.
monica Well if-if that's what it is, then it's-it's crazy.
ross Monica's right. We're talking about getting married here. Okay? She-she can't just rush into this.
rachel Oh please, what do you know! You married a lesbian!
phoebe All right. I gotta go. I have break up with Vince.
chandler Oh, so you're going with the teacher, huh?
phoebe Yeah, I like Vince a lot, y'know? But, it's just Jason's so sensitive, y'know? And in the long run, I think sensitive it's just better than having just like a really, really, really nice butt. Jason! Definitely Jason! Okay, wish me luck!
all Good luck!
rachel OH MY GOD!!! Sorry, I was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.
phoebe Excuse me. Umm, is Vince here?
fireman Oh sure. Vince?!
vince Yo!!
phoebe Wow! I didn't know you guys actually used those.
vince So, what's up?
phoebe Umm, wow. This-this isn't gonna be easy. Umm, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
vince Uh-huh. G-good deal.
phoebe I'm sorry.
vince No-no it's okay. It's just that ah, I thought we had something pretty special here. And y'know I-I felt like you were someone I could finally open up to, and... That there's so much in me I have to share with you yet.
phoebe Oh my God, I didn't
vince I'm sorry, I can't talk. I'm gonna go write in my journal.
phoebe Wait-wait-wait! Wait!!
phoebe I'm telling you, if you want to take care of that thing, you should go to my herbal guy.
ross Thank you, but I want to remove it Pheebs. I don't want to make it savory.
monica Y'know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body, they tell their friends about it.
ross Gimme this.
rachel Hi! Okay, don't be mad at me, but I couldn't resist.
monica Brides magazines?
rachel Yes, and I know that you'd say no if he asked you, but I'm sorry; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this Donna Carin.
phoebe Oh, you so would! Oh, you should get that anyway. Like for clubbing.
monica It is so weird, I know what I said, but uh, this morning, I was lying in bed I was, I was imagining what it would be like to say yes. I know it's a little sudden, and it's a little rushed, and it's totally not like me to do something like this, but that doesn't mean I can't. Right? I mean I'm-I'm crazy about Pete, and I know that we want the same things, and when I thought about saying yes, it made me really happy.
rachel Oh my God.
monica I know. I need more pie.
phoebe Hey Mon umm, if you do get married, can I bring two guests?
rachel You didn't break up with that fireman?
phoebe No, that was my way of telling you. Well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive, he keeps a journal and he paints. He even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.
rachel Wow!
phoebe Yeah, well he'd prefer water colors, but y'know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.
monica So then, are you going to dump Jason?
phoebe Well, yeah, because I have to break up with someone, and... Okay so Jason is sensitive, but now so's Vince Plus, Vince has the body y'know? So... It's really just about the math.
phoebe Jason?
jason Yeah, come on in.
jason So Phoebe, you ah, sounded kinda serious on the phone, is ah, is anything wrong?
phoebe Nah-ha!

ross What's a koondis?
guru_saj I don't know, what's a koondis with you? Please, lie down! I've got a sav that oughta shrink that right up.
ross I guess it's worth a try.
guru_saj Oh sure, we should see results-Whoa!! Clearly not the way to go!!
ross What?! What?!
guru_saj We appear to have angered it.
ross We?! We angered it?!
guru_saj Oh, I think I see the problem. And I'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool. Love.

monica And I suppose you used a ring designer for that.
pete Yeah. Monica, I want you there in the front row when I win. I want you close enough to smell the blood. What do you think?
monica My parents will be so happy.
phoebe "Crazy underwear, creepin' up my butt. Crazy underwear, always in a rut. Crazy under--wear..." Oh No! What is he doing here? All right, just keep playing, just keep playing. You'll get through this; you'll be fine. Okay, thank you. And, as always no one talk to me after the show.

vince What?!
jason What?!
phoebe Yeah, okay, I've-I've been dating both of you, and it's been really horrible. 'Cause y'know it's been a lot of fun, for me. Umm, but I-I like you both, and I, and I didn't know how to chose, so... I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm terrible, I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.
vince Phoebe, Phoebe relax, it's okay. I mean we never said this was exclusive.

phoebe Well, I made you a candle light dinner in the park.
jason Y'know Phoebe, I'm gonna make this real easy for you.
phoebe Well, that could've been really awkward.
vince You made him a candle light dinner in the park?
phoebe Yeah, but I-I-I-I can do that for you, I'm gonna do that for you.
vince Uh yeah, I can't believe I ever went out with somebody who would actually have an open flame in the middle of a wooden area.
chandler Everything's gonna be all right. Okay, Dick?
guru_saj Hello, I am Guru Saj--Whoa!! That's supposed to be a duck right? 'Cause otherwise, this is waaay out of my league.
joey Yeah, yeah. He's got a, he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it. Is there something you can do?
guru_saj Hmm, let me see. Let me see. Do you think you could get him to eat a bat?
