rachel That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
chandler I'm sorry!
rachel You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
chandler Rachel, wait, wait.
rachel No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
chandler Can I just say one thing?
rachel What? What?!
chandler That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
rachel Oh!!
phoebe Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
roger That's pretty much it.
phoebe Oops!
roger But you tell it really well, sweetie.
phoebe Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
roger Okay. I'll miss you.
phoebe Isn't he great?
rachel He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
phoebe I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
monica So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
phoebe Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
rachel Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else?
chandler Oh, yes, could I have one of those.
rachel No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
chandler Okay.
roger Did I, uh, did I miss something?
chandler No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
ross You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
chandler It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
rachel Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
phoebe Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
rachel Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
chandler Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
rachel Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
chandler Okaaay, rock, hard place, me.
roger You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when when the laughter stops.
chandler Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
roger Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance.
chandler Huh.
roger I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty.
chandler Uhhuh, how did you know that?
roger It's textbook.
joey Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
all Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!
monica Hey, how long are you in the city?
mr_tribbiani Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I don't know this one.
phoebe Oh, this is my friend Roger.
roger Hi.
mr_tribbiani Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger.
roger You too, sir.
mr_tribbiani What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?
joey Dad, dad.
mr_tribbiani Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!
mr_tribbiani Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now
joey Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this isn't Ma?
mr_tribbiani Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician.
joey Sure. So how long you been...
mr_tribbiani Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?
joey Since then?!
mr_tribbiani No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy...Joe. Y'ever been in love?
joey ..I d'know.
mr_tribbiani Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
joey You're one to talk.
mr_tribbiani Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women.
joey Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
mr_tribbiani Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you.
joey It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows!
rachel I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
chandler What? What?
rachel Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
ross Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
chandler Y'know, I don't see that happening?
rachel C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
chandler Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
monica Hello?
phoebe It's Phoebe.
roger And Rog.
monica C'mon up.
chandler Oh, good. Rog is here.
joey What's the matter with Rog?
ross Yeah.
chandler Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
ross What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
ross Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
roger I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
ross Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
roger I don't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you...
monica Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
roger Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents.
ross That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
monica Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
phoebe Isn't he good?
ross Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
monica Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
ross Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
rachel You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
roger That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going.
phoebe Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
roger Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie...
phoebe Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
monica You're welcome.
roger Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love.
monica Hate that guy!
joey Night, you guys.
chandler Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
joey Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
ronni Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani.
joey I'm Joey Tribbiani.
ronni Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?
chandler Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
ronni Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.
chandler Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
ronni That's a good one!
mr_tribbiani Hey, Joe.
joey Dad, Ronni's here.
mr_tribbiani Huh?
ronni Hi.
mr_tribbiani Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here?
ronni Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting.
mr_tribbiani Thank you. Uh...
chandler So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
ronni Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train.
mr_tribbiani I don't want you taking that thing.
ronni Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?
joey Who-ah-ho.
mr_tribbiani We'll go to a hotel.
ronni We'll go to a hotel.
joey No you won't.
ronni No we won't.
joey If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
mr_tribbiani You're gonna keep an eye on us?
joey That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
ronni Wow. He's strict.
joey Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
ronni Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid.
chandler C'mon, I'll show you to my room...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by "No thanks, it's late."
joey Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
mr_tribbiani What kinda change?
joey Well, either you break it off with Ronni
mr_tribbiani I can't do that!
joey Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
mr_tribbiani Yeah, but this is
joey I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
chandler Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
joey Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
chandler Well, you're gonna.
joey I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
chandler Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
joey Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
chandler Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
joey No.
chandler No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say "No thanks, I'm married."
joey You really think so?
chandler Yeah. I really do.
joey Thanks, Chandler.
chandler Get off!
ronni Hi.
monica Hi...May I help you?
ronni Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?
monica Okay...who are you?
ronni Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?
monica Oh, c'mon in.
ronni Thanks.
rachel Hi, I'm Rachel.
ronni Hi.
rachel Bathroom's up there.
ronni Great.
rachel Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
ronni Oh, like, uh, five minutes?
rachel Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib.
mr_tribbiani Hey. Morning, dear.
rachel Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
joey What's the matter with you?!
rachel I thought it was Chandler!
chandler What? What?
rachel You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
chandler Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
all Hey, Pheebs.
phoebe Hey.
monica How's it going?
phoebe Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
phoebe So what's going on?
monica Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
ross I dunno, there's just something about...
chandler Basically we just feel that he's...
rachel We hate that guy.
all Yeah. Hate him.
ross We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
phoebe Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
all ..No, we hate him.
rachel We're sorry.
joey Ma! What're you doing here?
mrs_tribbiani I came to give you this and this.
joey Oww! Big ring!
mrs_tribbiani Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really.
joey Hold on, you-you knew?
mrs_tribbiani Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. "I'm sleeping over at my accountant's," I mean, what is that? Please!
joey So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
mrs_tribbiani Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby.
joey Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
mrs_tribbiani Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary.
joey I'm...happy...for you?
mrs_tribbiani Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was.
joey Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
mrs_tribbiani I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?
joey Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
mrs_tribbiani That's sweet. Could I take her?
joey With this ring? No contest.
roger What's wrong, sweetie?
phoebe Nothing, nothing.
roger Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon.
phoebe It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
roger Oh. They don't.
phoebe But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
roger What?
phoebe Intense and creepy.
roger Oh.
phoebe But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
roger Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way.
phoebe You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
roger Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'.
monica So you talked to your dad, huh.
joey Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
rachel Wow.
chandler Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
ross So Joey, you okay?
joey Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
rachel Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
chandler If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
phoebe Hey.
all Hey, Pheebs.
monica How's it going?
phoebe Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
all Awww.
phoebe Yeah, right.
all Aaawwwwww!!
rachel What happened?
phoebe I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
phoebe Hey, Joey. What's going on?
joey Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green.
monica Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
joey Sorry. Wrong boobies.
monica Hello, Joey.
mr_tribbiani Oh!..Hello, dear.
