chandler Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
shelley Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
chandler Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
shelley Do you want a date Saturday?
chandler Yes please.
shelley Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
chandler He's a he?
shelley Well yeah!..Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
chandler ..Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
rachel Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
chandler You did?
rachel Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
chandler Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
monica I did.
phoebe Yeah, I think so, yeah.
joey Not me.
ross Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
chandler You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
ross No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
chandler Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
phoebe I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
chandler Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
all Yeah! Right!
chandler WHAT IS IT?!
monica Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
all Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
chandler Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
monica Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
rachel Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
ross So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
rachel Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
monica Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
ross So, uh, how's she doing?
aunt_lillian The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
monica How-how are you, Mom?
mrs_geller Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here...What's with your hair?
monica What?
mrs_geller What's different?
monica Nothing.
mrs_geller Oh, maybe that's it.
monica She is unbelievable, our mother is...
ross Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
monica Oh God!
monica The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
ross Oh!..Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
mr_geller Not just restaurants, from our house.
nurse Mrs. Geller?
ross She looks so small.
monica I know.
ross Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
monica G'bye, Nana.
ross Bye, Nana.
monica Ross!
mrs_geller What is going on?!
ross Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
mrs_geller What?
ross She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
aunt_lillian What's going on?
mr_geller She may have died.
aunt_lillian She may have died?
mr_geller We're looking into it.
ross I, uh, I'll go see.
nurse This almost never happens!
ross Now she's passed.
chandler I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
rachel Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
phoebe Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
rachel So, um, did she...
ross Twice.
joey Twice?
phoebe Oh, that sucks!
joey You guys okay?
ross I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
phoebe Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
ross Nono, she's gone.
monica We checked. A lot.
phoebe Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?..I miss her.
rachel Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
phoebe Thanks!
rachel Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
joey Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!.So Chandler looks gay, huh?
phoebe Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
ross I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
mrs_geller Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
mrs_geller Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
ross I don't see why not.
ross Here's my retainer!
mr_geller I was just thinking. When my time comes-
monica Dad!
mr_geller Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
monica You what?
mr_geller I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
monica Define fun.
mr_geller C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
monica ..And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
mr_geller Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
monica That's probably what they'll say.
mr_geller I'd like that.
chandler Hey, gorgeous.
shelley Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
chandler No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
shelley Oh! Okay! Phew!
chandler So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
shelley I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
chandler ..Quality, right, great.
shelley Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
chandler Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
shelley What? He's cute!
chandler Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
shelley Is Brian...?
chandler No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
shelley Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
chandler Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me...I'm really not.
ross This one?
aunt_lillian No.
ross I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
aunt_lillian You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
mrs_geller You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
ross Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
aunt_lillian Wait! We need shoes!
ross Okay. Um, how about these?
mrs_geller That's really a day shoe.
ross And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
aunt_lillian Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
ross Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
aunt_lillian No, it really should be burgundy.
mrs_geller Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
ross No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
ross Oh my God..
mrs_geller Is everything all right, dear?
ross Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
ross How we doing, you guys ready?
monica Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
ross Some days it's all I can think about.
phoebe Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
rachel Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
phoebe What'd I say?
rachel Hm-m.
monica Are these the shoes?
rachel Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
ross What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
joey Morning. We ready to go?
chandler Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
monica It was a really beautiful service.
mrs_geller It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
joey What?
chandler Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
joey Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
chandler You're watching a football game at a funeral?
joey No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
chandler You are a frightening, frightening man.
rachel Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
ross Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
phoebe God, what a great day...What? Weather-wise!
ross I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
all God! Ross!
ross I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
phoebe Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
ross What, what is it?
phoebe You missed a belt loop.
ross Oh! No-n-
phoebe Okay, it's in spasm.
mrs_geller Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
chandler Oh, no-
andrea Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
chandler Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
phoebe Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
ross I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
monica Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
ross Not the first two, but the second two- woooo!..I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
phoebe Ooh! That's so nice...
ross ..Chandler!
chandler Hey.
ross And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
andrea You were right.
ross Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
rachel Oh, well you know who I love the most?
ross No.
rachel You!
ross Oh.. you don't get it!
mr_geller Whaddya got there?
joey Just a, uh... hearing disability.
mr_geller What's the score?
joey Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
mr_geller Beautiful!
rachel Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
mrs_geller Your grandmother would have hated this.
monica Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
mrs_geller No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
monica That sounds like Nana.
mrs_geller Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
monica ..I can imagine.
mrs_geller I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
monica That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
mrs_geller Tell her what?
monica How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
mrs_geller I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
monica Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
mrs_geller ..No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
monica Huh.
mrs_geller More wine, dear?
monica Oh, I think so.
mrs_geller Those earrings look really lovely on you.
monica Thank you. They're yours.
mrs_geller Actually they were Nana's.
mr_geller Now I'm depressed!.. Even more than I was.
rachel Hey, who's this little naked guy?
ross That little naked guy would be me.
rachel Aww, look at the little thing.
ross Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
chandler Who are those people?
ross Got me.
monica Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
rachel Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
monica Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
ross Looks like a fun gang.
joey Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
ross Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
chandler Hey, Lowell.
lowell Hey, Chandler.
chandler So how's it going there in Financial Services?
lowell It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
chandler Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
lowell I know. That's what I told her.
chandler Really.
lowell Yeah.
chandler So- you can tell?
lowell Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
chandler So you don't think I have a, a quality?
lowell Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
chandler He is?
lowell Yup, and waaay out of your league.
chandler Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
