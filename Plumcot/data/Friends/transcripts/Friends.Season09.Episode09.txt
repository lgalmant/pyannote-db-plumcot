joey_tribbiani Hey.How come you're answering your own phone?Where's your crazy assistant?
chandler_bing What's up Joe?
joey_tribbiani Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?
chandler_bing Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?
joey_tribbiani No, no, no.When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks gamecourtside!
chandler_bing Courtside?Oh my God.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.
chandler_bing That's so cool.I'll let Monica know.
monica_geller Hello?
chandler_bing Joey just called.He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.
monica_geller Really?But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant.If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.
chandler_bing But hey, it's courtside.The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. That's not the way to convince you.
monica_geller Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, "You can't go to the game.You have to spend time with me."So, if you could just realize it on your own
chandler_bing I know.You're right.I want to see you too.I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know?He's really looking forward to this.
monica_geller Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time.Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.Tell him that what little time we have is precious.
chandler_bing Yeah, ah, ahI'll think of something.
dr_ross_geller Wow!Wow, You look uháIt's just, aháThat dress uhá
rachel_green Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.
dr_ross_geller Well, well, they're good.It's been a while since I've seen you like this.You, you clean up good.
rachel_green Oh well, well thank you.Okay, stop.Stop looking at me like that.The last time that happened, that happened.á
dr_ross_geller Oh right, right.So, are you ah you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?

rachel_green Phoebe's Mike?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green I didn't know you guys hung out.
dr_ross_geller We don't.But I thought it would be nice to get to know him.You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.
rachel_green Oh that's so cute:Ross and Mike's first date.Is that going to be awkward?I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?
dr_ross_geller I don't know.But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know.He plays piano; I played keyboards in college.He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Hi

chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Welcome home.
chandler_bing Oh well, look at you.
monica_geller Yeah.What do you think?
chandler_bing Well, it looks great.It's just that well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath.So

joey_tribbiani Hey!How come the door's locked?
monica_geller Just a second.
chandler_bing No, no, no, no, no.Joey can't know that I'm here.
monica_geller Why not?
chandler_bing Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game.So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa.
monica_geller So, you lied to him?
chandler_bing Achhh.It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.Except with you.
joey_tribbiani Hey!Open the door.What's going on?á
joey_tribbiani What are you.Why are you dressed like that?
monica_geller Oh, because, umwell, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days.So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction.
joey_tribbiani Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before.
monica_geller Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation.You know, like, "Hi, How do I look?""Really sexy.Could I BE any more turned on?"
joey_tribbiani Okay.Whoa, whoa.Why are there two glasses of wine out?
monica_geller Because.one of them is for you.
monica_geller Cheers.Okay, buh-bye.á
chandler_bing You know, it's funny.I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself.Hi ya.
monica_geller You might want to keep practicing.
chandler_bing Yah.
chandler_bing It's Joey.Hey Joe.
joey_tribbiani Dude, come home!
chandler_bing What? Why?
joey_tribbiani COMEHOME.
chandler_bing Look I, I can't.What's going on?
joey_tribbiani I don't know how to tell you this but, uh I think Monica's cheatin' on ya.I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.
joey_tribbiani All right look.If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna.
chandler_bing NO!
joey_tribbiani I just heard him!

chandler_bing No! Wait!
joey_tribbiani I heard him again!
chandler_bing All right, look.Just stay there.I'm coming home.
joey_tribbiani Okay.Great.I'll see you when you get here.I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.
chandler_bing Is that really necessary?
joey_tribbiani Absolutely.You'd do it for me.Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.
dr_ross_geller Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?I mean, they said thirty minutes or less.Well, how long has it been?
mike_hannigan Eleven minutes.And now twelve.So, do you like the beer?
dr_ross_geller I do.I do.Although, it's actually a lager.
mike_hannigan huh.What's the difference between beer and lager?
dr_ross_geller I don't know.We could look it up.
mike_hannigan Things are about to get wild.
phoebe_buffay Oh God.Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?
rachel_green Oh God.It seems like forever ago.
phoebe_buffay I know.áSo, what's going on with you and Ross?
rachel_green Well, um I don't know.I mean, for a long time nothing.But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a ah little thing.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!I love things.What happened?
rachel_green Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked.And, ah, then we had a little um eye-contact.
phoebe_buffay Eye-contact?
rachel_green Mm-hmm.
phoebe_buffay I hope you were using protection.
waiter#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode09 Excuse me.Um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.
rachel_green Oh.Should we send them something back?
phoebe_buffay Oooh.Let's do.Let's send them mashed potatoes.
rachel_green No!Wait!No, no.Don't do that!That's going to make them think they can come over here.
phoebe_buffay So?What if they do?
rachel_green Well, we're not here to meet guys.You have a boyfriend, I have a b. baby and a Ross.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen.We're just having fun.You know, not everything had to go as far as "eye-contact."
monica_geller Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.
chandler_bing Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him?I heard it.
monica_geller I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.
chandler_bing All right.I've got a plan.I'll go down the fire escape.
monica_geller Yes, because all good plans start with, "I'll go down the fire escape."
chandler_bing Hear me out woman.I'll go down the fire escape.Then, I'll wait for a while.Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa.Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.
monica_geller Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out?I heard it.
chandler_bing I'm just going to wait for a little while.
monica_geller Scary pigeon's back?
chandler_bing It's huge.
rachel_green Oh my God.I can't believe you live in that building.My grandmother lives in that building.Ida Green?No sense of personal space?Kind of smells like chicken?Looks like a potato.
bill "Spuds" is your grandmother?
rachel_green That's my bubby!
kevin So, we're on our way to a couple of parties.Um. maybe we can get your numbers and give you guys a call if we find something fun.
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I'm sorry.We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys.I, I have a boyfriend.
kevin All right. It's no big deal. BILL: So, she has a boyfriend. What is your situation? RACHEL: Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend.But um. BILL: Then, can I have your number? RACHEL: I'm sorry, no. BILL: Okay. RACHEL: Oh sure.PHOEBE: Oh my God, you're giving your real number. BILL: Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call later tonight. RACHEL: Great. BILL: Bye PHOEBE: Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?
rachel_green I don't know.He was cute, and he liked me.It was an impulse.
phoebe_buffay What about Ross?What about your moment?Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?
rachel_green No.No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go."Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before."
rachel_green "Yeah.""Me too."
rachel_green "Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it."
rachel_green "Yeah.""Me neither."
rachel_green "Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?"
rachel_green "Yeah.That works for me."
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I see what you mean.By the way, nice Ross imitation.
rachel_green Oh, thanks.
phoebe_buffay But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.
rachel_green Wha. hey!
phoebe_buffay Better!
rachel_green Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know?I should just move on with my life.
phoebe_buffay Really?You're moving on from Ross?
rachel_green I don't know.Do I have to decide right now?
phoebe_buffay Well, you kind of just did.That guy is going to call you tonight.Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.
rachel_green Oh God, Ross.Ross is going to pick up the phone.Oh, I have to get my number back.Oh my God.He's gone.
phoebe_buffay "Oh, I have to get my number back.Oh my God.He's gone."Dead on.
mike_hannigan Ya know, I'm going to take off.
dr_ross_geller So soon?
mike_hannigan Well, yeah.

mike_hannigan Uh, no.I just left.
phoebe_buffay Well, you have to go back in.
mike_hannigan Wha?Go back?To the "land where time stands still"?
phoebe_buffay I'm so sorry honey, but, okay, Rachel gave this guy her number and, um, she doesn't want Ross to answer the phone.So, you have to intercept all his calls.
mike_hannigan I can't do that!
phoebe_buffay He says he can't do that.
rachel_green Oh give me , , ,Hi, Mike?Hi.Listen.I know this is a lot to ask, but you know what?If you do this I Phoebe will do anything you want.Seriously, I'm talking dirty stuff.
phoebe_buffay All right. Hello?Hi.I'm sorry about her, but she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.
mike_hannigan All right.I'll do it.But really, how much dirtier can it get?
phoebe_buffay Oh, Mike.Bye.
mike_hannigan Hey buddy.
dr_ross_geller Uh, hi.
mike_hannigan Um, can I come back in?
dr_ross_geller Why?á
mike_hannigan I, I was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.
dr_ross_geller But you left.
joey_tribbiani Wow!That didn't take long.I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.
chandler_bing Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.
monica_geller Chandler!You're home!
chandler_bing That's right.You're husband's home.So, now the sex can stop.
monica_geller What are you saying?
chandler_bing Joey said that you're in here with another man.
monica_geller There's no man in here.How dare you accuse me of that.á
joey_tribbiani All right.All right.Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?Bwa-ah-ah!
chandler_bing What is he doing?
monica_geller I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.
joey_tribbiani Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.
chandler_bing All right.Well, I'll check the guest room.
joey_tribbiani Why do I smell men's cologne?
monica_geller I think that's you.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah.I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.
chandler_bing There's nobody here Joe.
joey_tribbiani I guess not.
monica_geller I can't believe you thought I was cheating.You own me an apology.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, right Monica.I'm so sorry.
monica_geller Ah, it's an honest mistake.It could happen to anyone.All right, see ya.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, whoa.Wait a minute.Wait a minute.If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?
chandler_bing I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?
mike_hannigan So, except for the fermentation process, beer and ale are basically the same thing.Fascinating isn't it.
dr_ross_geller Maybe you should look up "fascinating."
mike_hannigan I'll get it.Hello?Ross's place.Mike speaking.It's for you.
dr_ross_geller I don't understand what just happened here.
joey_tribbiani What's going on?
chandler_bing I'm sorry.I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't knowI didn't think you'd understand.
joey_tribbiani What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife?Huh?Do you think I'm like, "Duh."á
monica_geller Joey?
joey_tribbiani Yeah?á
monica_geller I don't know what to say.We shouldn't have lied to you.
chandler_bing Yeah.I feel so bad.Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't.But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.
chandler_bing I'm sorry. áThat's the one thing I can't do.I promised I'd be with Monica.
joey_tribbiani All right.
monica_geller You can go.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller You should go to the game.It's okay.I want you to.
chandler_bing Really?You're gonna be okay?

chandler_bing You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?
monica_geller It's gonna be so hot!á
chandler_bing Okay, bye.
