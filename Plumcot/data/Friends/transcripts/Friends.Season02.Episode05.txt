dr_ross_geller Man, I sure miss Julie.
chandler_bing Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
dr_ross_geller You ever figure out what that thing's for?
chandler_bing No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
machine#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode05 Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
jade Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
chandler_bing What?
jade I got a little drunk...and naked.
chandler_bing Bob here.
chandler_bing What've you been up to?
jade Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
chandler_bing Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
dr_ross_geller I know.
chandler_bing I'm back.
jade So, are we gonna get together or what?
chandler_bing Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
jade Great, I'll see you then.
chandler_bing Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
dr_ross_geller Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
chandler_bing I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
dr_ross_geller Oh my god. You are pure evil.
chandler_bing Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
all@ Hi, Julie!
rachel_green Hi, Julie.
chandler_bing Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
phoebe_buffay Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
chandler_bing Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
joey_tribbiani Do we need a cake?
chandler_bing Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
rachel_green Yeah, whoosh!
chandler_bing But it's Ross.
phoebe_buffay It's Ross.
joey_tribbiani All right.
chandler_bing I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
dr_ross_geller Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
chandler_bing You know, I think I might just.
rachel_green So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
joey_tribbiani Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
phoebe_buffay Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
rachel_green Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
joey_tribbiani Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
phoebe_buffay Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
joey_tribbiani For Ross.
rachel_green For Ross, Ross, Ross.
monica_geller Oh my god.
rachel_green Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
joey_tribbiani If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
monica_geller Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
dr_ross_geller I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
chandler_bing Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
dr_ross_geller That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
chandler_bing We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
dr_ross_geller Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
chandler_bing All right.
dr_ross_geller Go.
chandler_bing Hi.
jade Hi.
chandler_bing Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
jade Yes?
chandler_bing Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
jade How did you--?
chandler_bing I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
jade Thanks.
chandler_bing No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
monica_geller Who is also in charge of purchasing.
dr_ross_geller Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
monica_geller Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
dr_ross_geller Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
monica_geller Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
joey_tribbiani Cool.
phoebe_buffay Let's see!
dr_ross_geller That's fine, I'll just wait!
monica_geller Oh, sorry.
joey_tribbiani Sorry, sorry.
dr_ross_geller Monica!
waiter Are we ready to order?
rachel_green Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
waiter Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
phoebe_buffay Wow, look at these prices.
rachel_green Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
joey_tribbiani What are these, like famous chickens?
chandler_bing Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
dr_ross_geller Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
chandler_bing Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
dr_ross_geller Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
waiter Do I dare ask?
monica_geller Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
dr_ross_geller That sounds great. Same for me.
waiter And for the gentleman?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
waiter You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
rachel_green Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
waiter And what will that be on the side of?
rachel_green Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
waiter And for you?
phoebe_buffay Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
chandler_bing I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
waiter Anything else?
chandler_bing Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
dr_ross_geller Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
rachel_green Um, everyone?
dr_ross_geller Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
joey_tribbiani Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
monica_geller Oh, thank you!
dr_ross_geller So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
phoebe_buffay No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
chandler_bing Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
dr_ross_geller Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
phoebe_buffay Not for you.
monica_geller All right, what's goin' on?
rachel_green Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
phoebe_buffay Fine. All right, fine.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing You can tell us.
dr_ross_geller Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
joey_tribbiani Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
monica_geller Ok.
dr_ross_geller I hear ya.
chandler_bing We can talk about that.
phoebe_buffay Well, then...Let's.
dr_ross_geller I, I just never think of money as an issue.
rachel_green That's 'cause you have it.
dr_ross_geller That's a good point.
chandler_bing So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
joey_tribbiani 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
dr_ross_geller Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
rachel_green Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
monica_geller If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
dr_ross_geller G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
chandler_bing No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
dr_ross_geller Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
phoebe_buffay No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
dr_ross_geller No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
monica_geller All of us.
chandler_bing Together.
dr_ross_geller Not at the concert.
rachel_green Ok.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Thank you.
joey_tribbiani Thanks.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
chandler_bing So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
chandler_bing Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
monica_geller I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
phoebe_buffay Oh, it's like a skit.
monica_geller Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
dr_ross_geller Whoo!
phoebe_buffay Cool.
monica_geller Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
dr_ross_geller But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
chandler_bing By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
dr_ross_geller Come on.
chandler_bing Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
monica_geller It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
phoebe_buffay So...Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Could you be less enthused?
joey_tribbiani Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
monica_geller Like?
joey_tribbiani Charity.
monica_geller Charity?
dr_ross_geller We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
rachel_green Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
phoebe_buffay Actually, it makes us feel that big.
dr_ross_geller I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
chandler_bing If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
joey_tribbiani Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
rachel_green Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
phoebe_buffay I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
rachel_green Me neither.
joey_tribbiani Me too.
monica_geller Guys, we bought the tickets.
phoebe_buffay Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
chandler_bing Why did you look at me when you said that?
monica_geller Well, I guess now we can't go.
rachel_green What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
monica_geller You know what? You're right.
phoebe_buffay Fine.
dr_ross_geller Fine.
joey_tribbiani Fine.
chandler_bing Fine.
rachel_green Fine.
monica_geller All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
dr_ross_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing Yeah?
dr_ross_geller Geez! Are you ready?
chandler_bing Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
dr_ross_geller Whoa! You had sex today?
chandler_bing Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
dr_ross_geller Wow.
chandler_bing Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
dr_ross_geller Still doing the screening thing?
chandler_bing I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
machine#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode05 Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
jade Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
chandler_bing Bob here.
jade Oh, hi.
chandler_bing So, uh, you met someone, huh?
jade Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
chandler_bing So, uh, how was he?
jade Eh.
chandler_bing Eh?
jade Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
chandler_bing Well, that makes me feel so good.
jade It was just so awkward and bumpy.
dr_ross_geller Bumpy?
chandler_bing Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
jade Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
monica_geller You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
chandler_bing So, let's go.
dr_ross_geller Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
chandler_bing Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
monica_geller You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
joey_tribbiani Come on you guys, one more time.
phoebe_buffay Ok. One.
joey_tribbiani Nooo.
monica_geller That was amazing!
dr_ross_geller Excellent, that was excellent.
chandler_bing I can't believe the guys missed this.
dr_ross_geller What guys? Oh, yeah.
steven_fishman Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
monica_geller Do I know you?
steven_fishman You used to be my babysitter.
monica_geller Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
steven_fishman Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
monica_geller You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
steven_fishman Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
monica_geller Uh, wait, backstage?
steven_fishman Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
dr_ross_geller Ross.
chandler_bing Chandler.
steven_fishman How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
dr_ross_geller Hey, you guys.
rachel_green Happy birthday.
dr_ross_geller Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
rachel_green Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
monica_geller Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
rachel_green Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
monica_geller Uh, good.
dr_ross_geller Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
chandler_bing Yeah, we really missed you guys.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
phoebe_buffay We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
monica_geller No, I just, I fell down.
rachel_green On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
monica_geller You know, a party, or--
rachel_green What party?
dr_ross_geller It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
joey_tribbiani You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
chandler_bing Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
rachel_green Who gave you that hickey?
monica_geller That would be the work of a Blowfish.
rachel_green Oh!
phoebe_buffay Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
dr_ross_geller Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
rachel_green What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
monica_geller It's work.
chandler_bing I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
joey_tribbiani And we don't work hard?
monica_geller Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
chandler_bing I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
joey_tribbiani And you feel like we hold you back.
chandler_bing Yes.
rachel_green Oh!
chandler_bing No.
monica_geller Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
waitress#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode05 Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
joey_tribbiani Let me get that. You got five bucks?
machine#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode05 Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
jade Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
