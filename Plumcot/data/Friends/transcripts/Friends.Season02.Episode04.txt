stranger#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode04 Hi.
rachel_green Hi, hi can I help you?
stranger#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode04 Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?
rachel_green Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her.
stranger#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode04 Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by.
rachel_green What?
stranger#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode04 Hey, how, how did you do that?
joey_tribbiani This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?
phoebe_buffay Well, I mean, I'm not
monica_geller I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.
monica_geller Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?
dr_ross_geller You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.
phoebe_buffay OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.
monica_geller Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger.
all@ Huuh.
monica_geller Well, didn't you?
phoebe_buffay I might have.
monica_geller I can't believe you didn't tell me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.
monica_geller What have I not told you?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.
rachel_green What!
monica_geller Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat.
chandler_bing I didn't know it was a big secret.
monica_geller Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.
phoebe_buffay You have a third nipple?
chandler_bing You bitch.
dr_ross_geller Whip it out, whip it out.
chandler_bing C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.
rachel_green Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?
joey_tribbiani I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
dr_ross_geller Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.
all@ Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.
chandler_bing Joey was in a porno movie.
all@ Huuh.
chandler_bing If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.
dr_ross_geller You were in a porno?
joey_tribbiani Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.
monica_geller That is wild.
dr_ross_geller So what's it shaped like?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, is there a hair on it?
joey_tribbiani What happens if you flick it?
dr_ross_geller So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?
chandler_bing Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.
julie You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.
chandler_bing Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?
dr_ross_geller You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?
rachel_green Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.
monica_geller Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.
rachel_green Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it.
all@ Woah.
joey_tribbiani Foxy lady.
julie Where you goin'?
phoebe_buffay Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.
joey_tribbiani The Ice Capades?
chandler_bing No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.
monica_geller I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.
phoebe_buffay OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.
dr_ross_geller Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?
chandler_bing Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . .
dr_ross_geller OK sweetie, I'll see you later.
julie See you later Rach.
rachel_green Bye-bye Julie.
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey, c'mon, cut it out.
dr_ross_geller Hey?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Can I ask you somethin'?
rachel_green Sure.
dr_ross_geller Naa.
rachel_green What? C'mon, talk to me.
dr_ross_geller OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?
rachel_green Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?
dr_ross_geller Technically, huh, no.
rachel_green Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?
dr_ross_geller No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .
rachel_green No, no no no, don't need to know the details.
dr_ross_geller It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.
rachel_green No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I think it's sexy.
dr_ross_geller Sexy?
rachel_green Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
dr_ross_geller No kidding?
rachel_green Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I'd wait.
dr_ross_geller You'd wait?
rachel_green Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.
dr_ross_geller Really?
rachel_green Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.
dr_ross_geller Women really want this?
rachel_green More than jewelry.

rachel_green Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?
dr_ross_geller Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

dr_ross_geller Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . .
chandler_bing What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.
dr_ross_geller Pop it in.
joey_tribbiani I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people.
rachel_green Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.
dr_ross_geller What's wrong with people having sex?
rachel_green Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.
monica_geller Hell, I wanna see Joey.
julie So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.
chandler_bing OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.
monica_geller All I say is, she better get the job.
dr_ross_geller Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
joey_tribbiani Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,

phoebe_buffay Ohh. . .K. How come?
duncan Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.
phoebe_buffay What?
duncan Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight.
phoebe_buffay Huuh.
duncan Yeah, I know, I.
phoebe_buffay I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.
duncan I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.
phoebe_buffay So how long have you known?
duncan Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.
phoebe_buffay And um, and there's actually a, a woman?
duncan Her name's Debra.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?
duncan Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.
phoebe_buffay Sure.
duncan But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.
phoebe_buffay I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'
duncan I'm, I'm still me.
phoebe_buffay Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
monica_geller You know, it still smells like monkey in there.
julie That saves us a conversation.
chandler_bing Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.
joey_tribbiani Me too, we should get goin'.
rachel_green No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.
monica_geller Rachel, that's all we do.
rachel_green Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?
julie What about Julie?
rachel_green Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.
julie Well, that could take a while.
rachel_green So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?
chandler_bing I got the time to get to know Julie.
joey_tribbiani I got time.
monica_geller Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go? That's fine.
rachel_green OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?
julie Well, in a nutshell. . .
rachel_green Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh.
phoebe_buffay So, um, have you told your parents?
duncan No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .
phoebe_buffay Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.
duncan I love you Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
julie And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.
rachel_green Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?
julie No Cobb, as in cobb salad.
rachel_green Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?
chandler_bing I'm goin' home.
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?
dr_ross_geller Goodnight.
rachel_green So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .
dr_ross_geller Oh, no no, I am.
rachel_green Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?
dr_ross_geller Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.
rachel_green Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?
dr_ross_geller I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.
rachel_green OK, gook luck.
dr_ross_geller Wha, uhh, what?
rachel_green Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.
dr_ross_geller OK, now I'm nervous.
rachel_green Maybe you should put it off.
dr_ross_geller No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.
rachel_green I know, yeah, sorry.
dr_ross_geller What, it's not your fault.
rachel_green Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.
dr_ross_geller Really?
rachel_green Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen.
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh.
rachel_green And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.
dr_ross_geller Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight.
rachel_green Ohh, God.
dr_ross_geller Good morning.
woman_on_bench Well, somebody got some last night.
dr_ross_geller Twice.
