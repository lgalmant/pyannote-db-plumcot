chandler Ohh. Mmm.
rachel Hi.
chandler Hey, you have got to try this cheesecake.
rachel Oh, y'know I'm not that much of a sweet tooth. I--Wow. My God, so creamy. Oh my God, this is the best cheesecake I have ever had. Where did you get this?
chandler It was at the front door. When I got home. Somebody sent it to us.
rachel Chandler, this is not addressed to you. This is addressed to Mrs. Braverman downstairs. Thief.
chandler I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.
rachel Why, why not?
chandler Because it's too delicious.
rachel Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.
chandler No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.
rachel Oh, I'm sorry what?
joey All right, I should get going, big day a work. Y'know I'm in a coma? Today, they do this test on me and it turns out I'm not brain dead.
chandler So
joey Ah-ah-ah Mr. Smartie Pants, it's just not my character that's not brain dead. Hey, so Pheebs, we still on for tonight?
phoebe Absolutely!
joey I'll see you at 8:00.
phoebe Okay.
chandler Oh, what's at 8:00?
phoebe Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey. We get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.
ross Wow, did not know that! May I say how lovely you look today?
phoebe Duly noted.
ross Thanks. Oh! So for tomorrow, do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?
monica What are you talking about?
ross Cousin Frannie's wedding, its tomorrow night.
monica You were invited?!
ross No.
monica My God, I can't believe this! I mean I knew that mom and dad were invited, but I thought that was it! I mean from the ages 7 to 9 Frannie and I were inseparable!
chandler Well, maybe since the age of 9, Frannie's made some new friends.
ross Well l-look okay, it's probably just a mistake. Let me call Aunt Sheryl okay? Maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.
monica Yeah, well you call her and tell her that y'know when we were kids her precious little Frannie tried to undress me several times, okay? And if I hadn't have stopped her, there probably wouldn't even be a wedding to go too.
ross Y'know, she tried to undress me too.
chandler I used to undress my cousin Glenn.
phoebe Joseph Francis Tribbiani are you home yet?!!
rachel Umm, I think he's still out. What's wrong?
phoebe Well, I'll tell you Rachel Karen Green, I had plans with Joey tonight and he left me this note.
rachel "Pheebs, can't make it, got a date. Talk to you later. Big Daddy." Big Daddy?
phoebe Oh that's a nickname we were trying out.
ross Hey, y'know what nickname never caught on? The Ross-A-Tron!
joey Hey!
phoebe Oh! Here's Joseph Francis!
joey Oh-Wha-Ho! What are you middle naming me for?! I left you a note!
phoebe So what?! That doesn't give you the right to ditch me!
joey Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!
ross Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.
phoebe I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!
joey Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.
phoebe Well, it does.
joey Okay, can I-can I make it up to you? Huh? I'm sorry. How about uh, dinner tomorrow night?! I'll pay for myself!
phoebe Okay, you wore me down.
ross Hey Joe, while you're over there how about another beer for the Ross-A-Tron?
joey The Ross-Is that back?!!
rachel Hi!
chandler Another cheesecake came! They delivered it to the wrong address again!
rachel So just bring it back downstairs, what's the problem?
chandler I can't seem to say goodbye.
rachel Are you serious?! Chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more?
chandler Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!
rachel It was cheesecake. It was fine. It had a buttery, crumbly, graham cracker crust, with a very rich yet light, cream cheese filling... Wow! My whole mouth just filled with saliva!
chandler Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.
rachel Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.
chandler Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?
rachel Momma's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.
joey Awww! Mel Torme died.
monica Joey, that paper's like a year old!
joey Aw! Does that mean the Sam Goody's sale is over?!
ross Hey.
joey Hey.
monica Hey.
ross So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn't a mistake. Ahh, there's-there's limited seating in the hall.
monica Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!
ross Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.
monica Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!
ross Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.
monica Joan?
ross Yeah, Joan Tedeski my date. She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department. Tall, very beautiful, and despite what some people say, not broad backed!
monica Wait a minute, you got Ross Gellar and guest?! I wasn't invited and you got "and guest?!"
joey Uh-uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt on Ross's behalf. I-I think the rule applies here y'know, since she has a chance to get on broad back
ross Not broad backed!
monica Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!
ross What? I can't cancel on Joan!
monica Why not?!
ross Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?
monica Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.
ross Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.
joey Aww that's nice. Family should be there, huh? This is her wedding, happiest day of her life.
monica We'll see.
chandler Well, thank you for lunch.
rachel What? Wait a minute, I didn't pay, I thought you paid!
chandler So apparently we just don't pay for food anymore. Do you see what I see?
rachel Its still there!
chandler Mrs. Braverman must be out.
rachel She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.
chandler By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.
rachel No that could kill her.
chandler Well, we don't want that.
rachel No so we're protecting her.
chandler But we should take it.
rachel But we should move quick.
chandler Why?
rachel Because I think I just heard her moving around in there.
chandler Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
phoebe Oh my God! That's David!
monica David who?
phoebe David the scientist guy, David that I was in love with, David who went to Russia and broke my heart David!
david Oh my God!
phoebe Oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.
david Phoebe?
phoebe David! What-what are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?
david Yeah, I'm just, I'm just in town for a conference. Umm, God you look phenomenal!
phoebe Well... Yeah. You look great too. Did you get a haircut?
david Yeah. Well I-I got like thirty of them.
phoebe Yeah.
david Umm, look I-I-I got a confession to make
phoebe Uh-huh.
david Uh, I-I-I was hoping to run into you here. I didn't know whether I should call or not, y'know I-I was only in town for a few days. And y'know, I didn't want to intrude on your life or-or anything like that, but I-I really wanted to see you and-but I didn't know if you wanted to see me.
phoebe Well, of course I would want to see you. I...I think about you all the time.
david Really? Because I think about you all the time.
phoebe Really?
david I mean, there's a statue in Minsk
phoebe Uh-huh.
david That reminds me of you so much, I mean umm, it-it's actually of Lenin. But, y'know at certain angles
phoebe Yeah.
david Umm, anyway...Do you want to have dinner tonight?
phoebe Yes! Oh no!
david Oh. Uh, what?
phoebe I can't. I can't believe I have plans, I can't. Can you do it tomorrow night though?
david Uh no, I have to go in a few hours. I have to be on the red-eye. Well listen, y'know, next time you're in Minsk umm
monica Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second?
phoebe Uh-huh.
monica What are you doing?
phoebe Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
monica So! He'll understand!
phoebe No he won't. And that's not even the point! Monica, I made a whole speech about you do not cancel plans with friends! And now y'know what? Just because, potentially, the love of my life comes back from Russia just for one night, I-I should change my beliefs?! I should change beliefs! No! No! No, if I don't have my principles, I don't have anything!
monica God, you are so strong.
phoebe Or! I should rush through dinner with Joey and I can meet David at 9:00!
rachel Oh my God! That is so good!
chandler I'm full, and yet I know if I stop eating this, I'll regret it.
joey Hey!
rachel Hey!
joey What do you got there?
rachel Oh it's umm, it's tofu cake. Do you want some?
chandler What are you doing tonight?
joey Huh? Uh
chandler Dude! Dude!
joey Oh! Sorry. Uh, I've got those plans with Phoebe, why?
chandler Oh really? Uh, Monica said she had a date at 9:00.
joey What?! Tonight?!
chandler That's what Monica said.
joey After she gave me that big speech?! She goes and makes a date with a guy on the same night she has plans with me? I think she's trying to pull a fast one on Big Daddy!
ross Oh here, I think this is us. Yeah.
monica Limited seating my ass. Let's see who made the cut. Hi!
the_wedding_guest Hi!
monica I'm Monica Gellar. Who do you know the bride and groom?
the_wedding_guest Oh, I used to work with Frannie.
monica Used to work with her. Used to! I'm a relative and I didn't get invited! A blood relative! Blood!!
ross Stop saying, "Blood" to strangers.
monica So, how about you huh? How do you know the happy couple?
the_second_guest We went to college with both of them and now we live next door.
monica Okay, you're fine.
the_waiter Hey!
phoebe Hey!
the_waiter Are you guys ready?
phoebe Yes! I will have the green salad, umm the house salad, and water's fine.
the_waiter Okay.
phoebe Okay.
the_waiter And for you sir?
joey Yeah, this slow roasted salmon, just how slow are we talkin' here?
the_waiter It's uh, it's already been roasted.
joey Ohh, then no. Maybe I should hear those specials again.
phoebe Oh Joey, we've heard the specials three times! Okay? There's prime rib, mahi mahi, and a very special lobster ravioli.
the_waiter Actually we're out of the lobster ravioli.
joey Oh well, that changes everything! Y'know what Pheebs?
phoebe Huh?
joey You were right before. I mean, friends are so important.
phoebe Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.
joey Y'know-y'know what I really want?
phoebe What?
joey Is to have a long, long talk. Y'know? Get Joey out on the open road and really open him up.
the_waiter Any progress?
joey Yes! I will have the lobster ravioli.
phoebe God Joey, this is taking forever!
joey What's the rush? What?
phoebe W-w-I just-it's that-I have-y'know I have-I have an appointment. And it's very important.
joey Whoa-whoa, what is it?
phoebe Well... It's a date.
joey A date?! No, no Pheebs you-you must be mistaken, because I know you wouldn't schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend!
phoebe Come on Joey, don't make me feel badly about this.
joey No, I'm gonna!! That's right! Yeah, you made me feel really guilty about goin' out with that girl! Like-like-like I did something terrible to you! And now Pheebs, you're doing the same thing!
phoebe That-It's not the same thing! This is totally different! This is with David! Remember David, the scientist guy? Okay, he's very special to me.
joey Okay, well my girl from the other night was special. She was a scientist too!
phoebe She was?
joey Well, she graduated from high school!
phoebe Okay, whatever. Y'know what? I don't have time have time to convince you because he's only here for four hours, and I'm gonna go see him!
joey Fine!
phoebe Yeah!
joey Fine!
phoebe Yeah!
joey What are you still doin' here?! I told you, lobster ravioli!
phoebe Hey!
david Hey! Oh, I was just about to leave. I-I-I-I didn't think you were coming.
phoebe Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
david Well, I'm very glad you're here.
phoebe Oh, you're such a gentleman. Come on! We're going to my place!
chandler Are you eating the cheesecake without me?!
rachel Mm-mmm.
chandler I will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now. How can you eat the cheesecake without me?!
rachel Oh, what are you going to do?! Are you gonna go run tell Monica?! Are you gonna tell Joey?! No! Because then you will have to tell them what we did! We are desert stealers! We are living outside the law!
chandler Y'know what? I don't trust you with this cake anymore! And I got it first, and I'm takin' it back!
rachel What?! What?!
chandler Oh yes!
rachel Wait a minute!
chandler Oh yes!
rachel Oh no-no-no-no-no, no you don't!
chandler Oh yes! Oh yes!
rachel You think I trust you with it?! No! We're gonna split it! You take half and I take half!
chandler Well that's not fair, you've already had some!
rachel What? Oh, well then y'know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.
chandler What do we use to split it?
rachel Okay! All right, pick a half.
chandler Okay well, this side looks bigger. Uh... There's more crust on this side. Y'know? So, maybe if I measured
rachel Oh for God sake just pick a piece!
chandler All right, I'll pick that one.
rachel That's also the smaller piece. Okay, there you go. Enjoy your half my friend, but that is it. No sharing. No switching, and don't come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast. Oh!!!!
chandler Ohhh!
rachel Okay, you gotta give me some of your piece.
chandler Oh-ho-ho-ho-no! No! No switching! No sharing, and don't come crying to me! Ha-ha-ha! I may just sit here and have my cake all day! Just sit here in the hallway and eat my
the_woman Ross, sweetheart!
ross Oh, hey Aunt Millie.
aunt_millie Isn't it a beautiful wedding?!
ross Yes, yes it is. It's uh... Every time on the lips! Why?! Why on lips?!
monica Here's Frannie. Hmm, won't she be happy to see me?
ross Now wait a minute, you be nice! All right? I didn't bring you here so you can ambush her.
monica Frannie was the one who found your Playboys and showed them to mom.
ross That bitch!
frannie Monica! What
monica Am I doing here? Why? Surprised to see me? Ross brought me. How do you like that?!
ross Hi Frannie, congratulations.
monica You invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me?! Why?! What-Why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? What could I have possibly done?! Stuart!
frannie I believe you know my husband.
ross So it's really a question of who could you have possibly done.
david Oh, I hate this but I-I-I have to go. I-I can't miss my flight.
phoebe Are you sure? I'll bet there's another flight to Minsk in like
david July. Umm,
phoebe That's really beautiful. What does it mean?
david Please, clean my beakers. I don't get out of the lab much.
phoebe That's good. I got to admit, I thought it was something else.
david Yeah, I... Well I really actually wanted to say umm, that, but um, I figured I probably shouldn't because y'know, I...have to leave.
phoebe You're right! You're right. Don't say it.
david I-I do though.
phoebe I do too.
david Bye Phoebe.
phoebe Okay, now's not the time Joey. All right? You can yell at me tomorrow.
joey No! No! No Pheebs, I'm not gonna yell at you. I just y'know, started thinking about you and David and I...remember how bummed you were the first time he left. And I just... Oh Pheebs, come here. Are you okay?
phoebe No I'm not okay. The only guy I've ever been crazy about has gone to Minsk and I may never...I may never see him again.
joey Hey, y'know you could always visit him.
phoebe Oh right, like they're gonna let me have a passport.
joey Anything I can do? Whatever you need.
phoebe Well-But-Now, if-if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub-atomic particles y'know before he does, then he can come back.
joey I can give it a shot.
rachel Oh! Yay! Look! There's a piece that doesn't have floor on it!
chandler Stick to your side!
rachel Hey, come on now!
joey All right, what are we havin'?
monica Oh wait I forgot my wrap.
ross What? Oh, okay. Wait here.
aunt_millie Hi sweetie! Are you leaving?
ross Well
aunt_millie Give us a kiss. Come on! Come on!
ross Why?! Why on the lips?!
