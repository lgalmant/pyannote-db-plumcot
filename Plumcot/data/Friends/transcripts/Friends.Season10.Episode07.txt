dr_ross_geller Hey you guys!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what are you doing?
mike_hannigan Oh, figuring out our wedding plans.
chandler_bing That's funny, we were doing the same thing!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay It's really crazy! The hall, the dress, the food... I-I had no idea how expensive this stuff was!
chandler_bing Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers.
phoebe_buffay So what did you two do about it?
chandler_bing It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell.
dr_ross_geller There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money.
mike_hannigan I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, and I'm responsible for just like half of that.
phoebe_buffay But really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use?
mike_hannigan Are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at City Hall?
mike_hannigan I think it would make me wanna marry you even more.
dr_ross_geller I've got to say you guys, that's an incredible gesture!
chandler_bing Maybe you do that next time you get married!
dr_ross_geller No, no, no. The next time it's gonna be a Hawaii at sunset. But maybe the time after that!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani What's going on?
chandler_bing Our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment.
monica_geller We?
chandler_bing You know you don't want me to help. You can't have it both ways!
joey_tribbiani Hey, is this person who decides whether or not you... get a baby?
chandler_bing Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live.
monica_geller And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.
joey_tribbiani Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.
chandler_bing Little people?
joey_tribbiani Celebrity.
monica_geller Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?
chandler_bing What...? NO!
monica_geller Chandler?
chandler_bing I don't, and I'm offended by the insinuation!
monica_geller Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?
chandler_bing I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine.
monica_geller It isn't mine!
joey_tribbiani Well, I guess we'll never know whose it is!
the_charity_clerk May I help you?
phoebe_buffay Yes. We're here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children.
the_charity_clerk Well, any contribution, large or small, is always appreciated.
phoebe_buffay Well, I think you're gonna appreciate it the crap out of this one
the_charity_clerk Well, this is very generous!
phoebe_buffay And we don't want any recognition. This is completely anonymous.
mike_hannigan Completely anonymous. From two kind strangers.
phoebe_buffay Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.
the_charity_clerk Well if you like, we can include your names in our newsletter.
mike_hannigan Not necessary.
phoebe_buffay Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
mike_hannigan And "X" is spelled uhm... "Mike Hannigan".
the_charity_clerk Right. Well, on behalf of the children: thank you both very much.
phoebe_buffay Sure, I so glad we did this. It feels so good!
mike_hannigan It does. It feels really good!
phoebe_buffay Oh, look! And we get these free t-shirts!
the_charity_clerk Oh, actually, that's the shirt I wore to the gym.
phoebe_buffay Mhm... it's moist.
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green Hi! Emma will be up in a minute!
dr_ross_geller Oh, good!
rachel_green Oh hey Ross... Listen, I heard about you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's OK. I'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.
rachel_green Absolutely.
dr_ross_geller There was one! She's it! All the rest look like they should live under a bridge!
rachel_green So, uhm... what are you gonna do today?
dr_ross_geller Well, I was thinking of taking Emma to the playground!
rachel_green Oh my God, what!?
dr_ross_geller Like I said I was thinking of taking Emma to the museum of knives and fire!
rachel_green Ok, look, Ross. I do not want Emma going to the playground.
dr_ross_geller Be-caaauuuse...
rachel_green All right, well, if you must know... I had a traumatic... swing incident... when I was little.
dr_ross_geller Seriously?
rachel_green Yes, I was 4 years old and I was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain. And to get me out my mom had to-had to cut a big chunk of my hair! And it was uneven for weeks!
dr_ross_geller And you made it through that? I wonder who's gonna play you in the movie!
rachel_green Ok, fine! You can make fun of me. I do not want Emma going there. And I was thinking Claire Danes.
dr_ross_geller Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!
rachel_green Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!
dr_ross_geller Space is filled with orbiting children. Look, please, just come on, you know, when you'll see the look on Emma's face, I swear you won't regret it.
rachel_green All right!
dr_ross_geller Good, you don't want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children, do you?
rachel_green Irrational, huh? All right, well, I'll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment!
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, that's the same, I am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings!
monica_geller Oh my God, the adoption lady is early!
chandler_bing Ok, ok, here we go.
monica_geller Ok.
chandler_bing Here we go. Stand up straight. Big smile.
phoebe_buffay Hello, is this the creepy residence?
monica_geller We're waiting for the adoption lady, but, hey, I'm glad you're here. I was cleaning this morning and I found this I don't know if you wanna use it, but...
phoebe_buffay Awe, this is so sweet of you! But you know what? I won't be needing a veil, I actually won't be wearing a dress at all!
monica_geller I told you! I am not coming to a naked wedding!
phoebe_buffay No, no, no, we're not having a big reception, we took the money we were gonna spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity.
monica_geller That's crazy! I am sorry. I just can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that!
phoebe_buffay We, you know, we're different! We don't care about having a huge party. This is really nice for you, but, oh, please, I put this on? And, ow, I look , why, well, radiant. All right, well, who cares, I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.
monica_geller That's right. You're making a commitment and that's the same, whether you do that at the Plaza or, where are you gonna do it?
phoebe_buffay City Hall.
monica_geller Ow! Oh, that sounds nice! I am just there for jury duty. They really spruce that place up!
phoebe_buffay It's ok, it's ok. I made my decision. What I really want is a great big wedding
monica_geller Yay!
chandler_bing But you already gave all your money to charity!
phoebe_buffay Well, I'll just ask for it back!
chandler_bing I don't think you can do that!
monica_geller Why not! This is her wedding day, this is way more important than some stupid kids!
chandler_bing That's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption Lady.
rachel_green Ok, careful.
dr_ross_geller Ok.
rachel_green Careful, watch her hair. WATCH HER HAIR!
dr_ross_geller Rach, she's got like three hairs!
rachel_green I know but they're just so beautiful! Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.
dr_ross_geller I promise you she's safe! No watch how much she loves this.
rachel_green Ok.
dr_ross_geller Ready sweety?
rachel_green Ok.
dr_ross_geller Here we go!
rachel_green Ok, careful, ok. Oh, she's smiling! Oh my God, she does like it!
dr_ross_geller See, I told you!
rachel_green Awe! Oh my God! Looks, she's a little dare-devil! Oh, let me push, can I push?
dr_ross_geller Oh, absolutely!
rachel_green Ok. Oh God. Get the camera, it's in the diaper bag.
dr_ross_geller Ok! See? Scared of swings, I bet you feel pretty silly Ow!
mike_hannigan We're seriously asking for our money back?
phoebe_buffay It's for our wedding day! Right, now, is this guy gay or straight, because one of us gonna have to start flirting.
the_charity_clerk Wow! Are you here to make another donation the same day? I don't think that that's ever happened before.
phoebe_buffay Gay, go.
mike_hannigan Oh my God, I love your shirt!
phoebe_buffay The donation we made earlier, we k..., we w..., we want it back.
the_charity_clerk Excuse me?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. See, that money was for a big wedding, that we thought we didn't want, but it turns out we do.
the_charity_clerk So you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?
mike_hannigan Yeah! This feels really good.
phoebe_buffay I am sorry. I am, but this wedding is just really important to me.
the_charity_clerk Hey, it's not my business, besides it's probably a good thing. We really would have been spoiling the children, all those food, and warm clothing...
phoebe_buffay Hey, that's not fair! A person's wedding is important! And especially to me! Ok? I didn't have a graduation party! And I didn't go to Prom. And I spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to "kill me" or whatever. So I deserve a real celebration and I am not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.
mike_hannigan She could have been talking about either one of us.
laura Hi, I am Laura, I am here for your adoption interview.
monica_geller Hi, I am Monica and this is Chandler. Please come in.
laura Thank you!
monica_geller Would you like something to drink?
laura Oh, water would be fine.
monica_geller Ok. Great. I am so glad that you are here. We're really excited about getting this process started.
chandler_bing Oh, because we love kids. Love 'em to death.Well, not actually to death, that's just a figure of speech - we love kids the appropriate amount... as allowed by law.
laura Your place is just lovely.
monica_geller Ah, thank you. This building does have a wholesome family feel to it.
laura You know, I... I feel like I've been here before. Are any other couples in the building adopting?
monica_geller Is that that couple on the first floor? Because we should get a baby before them. Yeah! That guy tried to sell me drugs.
chandler_bing But other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.
laura Oh...
chandler_bing What?
laura I just realized why I remember this place.
monica_geller Really? What is it?
laura Oh, it's nothing. I went on a date with a guy who lived in this building and it didn't end very well.
monica_geller Ohh... that wouldn't by any chance be... Joey Tribbiani?
laura Yes!
chandler_bing Of course it was!
laura Yeah, we had a really great night and in the morning he promised he would call me and he didn't.
chandler_bing RAT BASTARD!
laura So you're not friends with him?
chandler_bing@monica_geller OH GOD NO! Nope, no, no, no. No! No, no. Nope! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. NO! No!
laura Well, I'm sorry I brought it up. So, are either one of you planning on staying at home with your child...
joey_tribbiani Hellooo? Anybody in there order a celebrity? OW!
laura What was that?
chandler_bing Oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. He's great with kids though.
rachel_green Oh, oh Ross, oh my God, are you okay?
dr_ross_geller SON OF A BITCH! Oh relax! I didn't say the 'F' word!
rachel_green Ross, see! I told you, those swings are evil! Alright, that is it. That is the last time Emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.
dr_ross_geller No! No, no, no, no, okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. It was my fault and kind of that kids fault. Who is still laughing. Nice.
rachel_green Ross, c'mon, please. Can we just get out of here, before somebody else gets hurt?
dr_ross_geller No wait, okay, okay, I have an idea. I want you to get on the swing, okay? And you'll see that there's nothing to be afraid of.
rachel_green I know what this is all about... You've always been jealous of my hair.
dr_ross_geller Look, I just think you're an adult, okay? And you should get over your silly fears.
rachel_green Alright fine. I'll do it.
dr_ross_geller Good.
rachel_green If you hold a spider.
dr_ross_geller WHAT? WHERE? WHERE?
rachel_green IF you hold a spider.
dr_ross_geller I know.
joey_tribbiani Guys? Everything ok? It's me, Joe...
chandler_bing AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA......AAAaaa-doption!!
laura What's going on?
chandler_bing Oh, just like I said. That crazy... Bert... roaming the halls.
joey_tribbiani Guys!?
monica_geller Keep on roaming Bert! We don't want any crazy today!
joey_tribbiani What's going on?
chandler_bing WE'LL TALK TO YOU LATER, BERT. EVERYTHNG'S FINE!!
joey_tribbiani Everything doesn't sound fine!
laura Is he alright out there by himself?
chandler_bing Oh yeah! He has a caretaker. His older brother... Ernie.
laura Bert and Ernie!
chandler_bing You can't make this stuff up!
mike_hannigan You never told me about that guy on your sweet sixteen. Oh, ugh. I'm sorry about that.
phoebe_buffay Oh! It ended okay. One of my friends shot him.
mike_hannigan Well, hey, at least you're getting a proper wedding. I mean, you really deserve that.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I really do. You know, I had nothing growing up. Just like the kids I took the money from.
mike_hannigan No! No, no. I see where this is going. Don't make me go back there.
phoebe_buffay Look, I can't have a wedding with this money now. It's tainted.
mike_hannigan Alright, fine. We'll give the money back.
phoebe_buffay And if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time, my friend hasn't shot anyone in a really long time.
laura Well, I must say, this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.
monica_geller Oh, by the way, you are more than welcome to look under any of the furniture, because, believe me, you won't find any porn or cigarettes under there!
laura Oh! Well, actually, before we look around, let me make sure I have everything I need up to here...
monica_geller Why don't I show you the baby's room?
chandler_bing What the hell are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Well, you wouldn't let me in, so I thought you were in trouble.
chandler_bing Well, we're not.
joey_tribbiani But you called me 'Bert'!? That's our code word for danger!
chandler_bing We don't have a code word.
joey_tribbiani We don't? We really should. From now on, 'Bert' will be our code word for danger.
monica_geller So that was the baby's room.
monica_geller What room should we see next?
chandler_bing Any room that isn't behind this couch!
monica_geller Some people don't get him, but I think he's really funny!
joey_tribbiani I did not care for that!
chandler_bing You have to get out of here. You slept with our social worker and you never called her back and she is still pissed, so she can't see you.
joey_tribbiani Ok, ok!
chandler_bing Ok!
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani I forgot my bat.
laura Oh my God!
chandler_bing And for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! And we don't want to buy your bat!
laura What are you doing here?
joey_tribbiani Bert! Bert! Bert! Bert!
laura Are you friends with him?
chandler_bing I can explain... Joey...
joey_tribbiani Uhm... ok... uhm... Well, yeah... You have got some nerve, coming back here. I can't believe you never called me.
laura Excuse me?
joey_tribbiani Oh... yeah... Probably you don't even remember my name. It's Joey, by the way. And don't bother telling me yours, because I totally remember it... lady. Yeah! I waited weeks for you to call me.
laura I gave you my number, you never called me.
joey_tribbiani No, no! Don't try to turn this around on me, ok? I'm not some kind of... social work, ok, that you can just... do.
laura Well, I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
joey_tribbiani Really? Think about it. Come on! You're a beautiful woman, smart, funny, we had a really good time, huh? If I had your number, why wouldn't I call you?
laura I don't know... Well, maybe I'm wrong... I'm sorry...
joey_tribbiani No, no, hey, no! Too late for apologies... ok? You broke my heart. You know how many women I had to sleep with to get over you?
laura Joey, wait!
joey_tribbiani NO! I waited a long time, I can't wait anymore...
laura I'm sorry that you had to see that. I'm so embarrassed...
chandler_bing Oh, that's really ok.
monica_geller Yeah, that we totally understand. Dating is hard.
laura Boy, you people are nice... And I've got to say... I think you're going to make excellent parents.
joey_tribbiani LAURA!
phoebe_buffay We're back!
the_charity_clerk Are you here to take more money? Because, I think what you're looking for is an ATM.
mike_hannigan No, no, we're here to give the money back.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, because you know what, it's... it's all about the children.
phoebe_buffay Although... it's also about the wedding... Ugh, alright... here. No... Oh God... Oh!
the_charity_clerk If I haven't said so already sir, congratulations!
mike_hannigan Ok, look! Enough! Alright? I'm stepping in. I'm putting my foot down! As your future husband I'm going to make this decision for us. Now... what do you think we should do?
the_charity_clerk You know what? It's not your decision anymore.
mike_hannigan What?
the_charity_clerk On behalf of the Children of New York, I reject your money.
phoebe_buffay But... but... but we're giving you this!
the_charity_clerk Yeah... And I'm giving it back to you... Come on! Consider it a contribution.
phoebe_buffay Well, this is very generous!
the_charity_clerk Please, take the check, go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.
mike_hannigan Well, I mean... It sounds good to me. And that way we can save up, come back in a few years and make an even bigger donation.
the_charity_clerk Absolutely! And when you do, make sure you ask for Brian.
phoebe_buffay Oh, is that you?
the_charity_clerk No!
monica_geller Hello...? Oh hi... Oh my God...! Really...? I can't wait to tell Chandler... Ok, goodbye.
chandler_bing Wrong number?
monica_geller It was Laura... She gave us a great report and we are officially on the waiting list.
chandler_bing That's great!
monica_geller Now we just have to wait for a call and... and someone tells us there's a baby waiting for us. Oh...
chandler_bing Hello...? Have you seen Joey's bat?
rachel_green Ok... I got a spider. There were two, I picked the bigger one.
dr_ross_geller Ok...
rachel_green Ok...
dr_ross_geller This feels perfectly normal. Ok, get on the swing!
rachel_green Ok... O-k...
rachel_green Ok...
rachel_green whoo... ok... wow... ok... OH!
dr_ross_geller See?
rachel_green A-alright! I can do this.
dr_ross_geller There you go! Good for you! And you know what, I'm actually getting used to this little guy. I don't really even feel him in here anymore.
rachel_green That's because he's on your neck.
dr_ross_geller Well... Whaa... aaah... aaahhh...
rachel_green ROSS!
