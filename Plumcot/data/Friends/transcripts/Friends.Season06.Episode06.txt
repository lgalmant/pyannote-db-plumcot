chandler_bing Okay! Listen, I'm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.
joey_tribbiani Right! And when is that due?
chandler_bing First of the month.
joey_tribbiani And that's every month?
chandler_bing No, just the months you actually want to live here.
joey_tribbiani Ahhh.
chandler_bing Okay, here is the phone bill.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God!!
chandler_bing That's our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why don't I just-why don't I just cover you for a while?
joey_tribbiani No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charity...anymore.
chandler_bing It's not charity, Joe
joey_tribbiani No! Forget it! Okay-I mean thanks, but I'm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, what's next? Come on.
chandler_bing Okay uh, here's the electric bill.
joey_tribbiani This is how much we pay for electric?!!!
chandler_bing Uh, yeah.
chandler_bing So, we'll do the rest of the bills later then?
phoebe_buffay So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?
chandler_bing No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.
phoebe_buffay Well, how much do you think he needs?
chandler_bing I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.
phoebe_buffay Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.
chandler_bing Well that would help the pride thing.
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?
monica_geller Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought we'd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay And also, my birthday.
monica_geller It's not your birthday.
phoebe_buffay What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you it's not your birthday!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?
chandler_bing Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.
dr_ross_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.
joey_tribbiani I don't know Ross, not if you're gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.
dr_ross_geller I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!
rachel_green Pheebs, I was wondering
monica_geller You're not dressed yet?! We're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!
rachel_green Well and clearly not a minute sooner.
monica_geller Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that you're packed.
rachel_green Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.
phoebe_buffay My God, I can't get a minute of peace around this place.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Monica's just gonna kill you.
rachel_green Yeah, yeah, I know.
phoebe_buffay Well, what you're wearing is fine for that.
monica_geller Rachel, I need to borrow-You're not packed!!!! You're not packed even a little bit!
rachel_green Surprise!!
monica_geller What?
rachel_green No, no don't get mad because look-this is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
monica_geller I'll be coordinator! Oh my God! I'm so sorry, I didn't get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, can't you Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay I have plans.
monica_geller You're plans were with us.
phoebe_buffay That's right.
monica_geller All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller Okay! Oh my God, thank you!!
phoebe_buffay Hurry! Monica's gonna make you pack! She's got jobs for everyone! Now, it's too late for me, but save your selves!
monica_geller Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, we're gonna start with
chandler_bing Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.
monica_geller I thought you said you were going to do nothing.
chandler_bing Yes, but for the last time.
monica_geller Okay fine, now Ross
dr_ross_geller Oh, but-but I can't do it.
monica_geller Why not?
joey_tribbiani I've got Ben.
dr_ross_geller Because, because I've got Ben.
monica_geller It's almost 8 o'clock, it's almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?
chandler_bing He's at a dinner party.
monica_geller Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!
dr_ross_geller Of course he is! What, do you think I'd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?
monica_geller All right, sorry.
dr_ross_geller I gotta go make a fake Ben.
joey_tribbiani Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.
chandler_bing Oh, I wish I'd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.
joey_tribbiani Oh that's okay. Hey, actually in a way it's kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!
chandler_bing Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?
joey_tribbiani What, are you crazy? You haven't beaten me once since my injury plagued '97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.
chandler_bing Yes it would. What do you say to $50?
joey_tribbiani Okay, you're on.
chandler_bing Okay, let's play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.
rachel_green Ohhhhhh, look it's the roller blades.
monica_geller Oh God!
rachel_green You remember when we got these?
monica_geller No.
rachel_green I guess you weren't there.
phoebe_buffay You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the time... You don't remember?
rachel_green I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.
monica_geller I'm gonna miss you so much.
phoebe_buffay Well, this doesn't have to be so sad though. Y'know? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much you're gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things you're not gonna miss.
monica_geller I don't think there's anything.
phoebe_buffay Come on, there's gotta be something.
monica_geller Nope, she's perfect.
rachel_green I have one.
phoebe_buffay Good! Great! You can go first.
rachel_green Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen.
phoebe_buffay Good that's a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Y'know? Does Rachel move the phone pen?
monica_geller Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.
phoebe_buffay Okay, good. There you go. Doesn't anyone feel better?
monica_geller Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.
rachel_green You get your messages!
monica_geller Yeah, well I don't think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.
rachel_green So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?
phoebe_buffay Great! It worked! No one's sad.
joey_tribbiani Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! That's like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! $500 that is a loooot of electricity! Whoo-ho-ho! I gotta buy some food.
chandler_bing Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.
joey_tribbiani You serious?
chandler_bing Oh yes!
joey_tribbiani Okay, get ready to owe me!
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani Okay, here we go. Ready?
chandler_bing No! No! No! No--one can beat me.
chandler_bing See? Now, that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.
monica_geller Hello? Oh, hi Ross! See? Other people call me!
rachel_green Ooh, your brother. Score!
monica_geller What's up?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I'm just over here with Ben. I thought we'd say hi.
monica_geller Oh, put him on!
dr_ross_geller Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. Oh, I guess he doesn't feel like talking right now. He's smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?
rachel_green You know what else I'm not gonna miss? "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"
monica_geller "Hi I'm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I'd better wash it and shrink it!"
rachel_green "I'm Monica, I don't get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"
phoebe_buffay Hey! I call her!
monica_geller "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"
rachel_green "Oh my God, I can't find a boyfriend! So I guess I'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"
phoebe_buffay Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations.
chandler_bing Still broken?
joey_tribbiani This sucks man! The last night you're here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.
chandler_bing Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack?
joey_tribbiani Nah, not my game.
chandler_bing Okay, uh, how about, how about-y'know what? We could play a new game. A new game, it's fun.
joey_tribbiani Well, what's it called?
chandler_bing Cups.
joey_tribbiani I don't know how to play Cups.
chandler_bing I'll teach ya! Come on, come on, it's really easy and really, really fun.
joey_tribbiani All right.
chandler_bing Okay, here you go. I have two queens, what do you have?
joey_tribbiani A two and a five.
chandler_bing Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!
joey_tribbiani Really?!
chandler_bing Oh yeah! Okay, let's play again. What do you got?
joey_tribbiani A four and a nine.
chandler_bing You're kidding right?
joey_tribbiani No. Why?
chandler_bing Well that's a full cup!
joey_tribbiani Damn! I am good at Cups!
monica_geller I'm not talking to her!
phoebe_buffay Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because she's the one who's leaving. It's harder for her!
monica_geller Well, maybe you're right-She made fun of my phone pen!
phoebe_buffay I know, I took it hard too.
monica_geller Listen Rachel, I feel really bad about-What are you doing?
rachel_green I'm unpacking!
monica_geller What?!
rachel_green I'm not moving! Is that picture straight?
monica_geller It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!
rachel_green Hey, y'know what? You're the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!
monica_geller Because it's my apartment!
rachel_green Well it's mine too! What else you got?!
monica_geller How about, you're moving!!
rachel_green Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!!
phoebe_buffay Hey, how are you guys doing?
rachel_green Great! Monica's moving!
monica_geller I am not!
rachel_green Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?!
phoebe_buffay Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know what's going on here. Okay, you guys... STOP!! I know that, I know that you're acting mad because you think that it'll make it easier to leave. But deep down you're still really sad. Deep-deep down.
monica_geller No Phoebe I am mad!
phoebe_buffay Well, deep-deep-deep down!
rachel_green Yeah, I'm just mad!
phoebe_buffay Then keep running.
chandler_bing You win.
joey_tribbiani Well, what did you have?
chandler_bing It doesn't matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?
joey_tribbiani Uh, wow, 700.
chandler_bing Not 700 exactly?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Double it!
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.
joey_tribbiani Really?
chandler_bing Hey, I didn't make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. Don't get to excited because that's not gonna happen unless you get-No way!
monica_geller Well, this is the last box of your clothes. I'm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"
rachel_green Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys, I don't mean to make things worse, but umm, I don't want to live with Rachel anymore.
monica_geller@rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay You're just so mean to each other! And I don't want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!
rachel_green Well, Phoebe that's fine because I'm not moving.
monica_geller Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Y'know I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but y'know Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.
rachel_green Oh really? Like what Monica?
monica_geller Y'know she has 147,000 pairs of boots
rachel_green Oh yeah, good start Mon.
monica_geller She lets you borrow them.
rachel_green Yeah and you stretch 'em out with your big old clown feet.
monica_geller Do you wanna live outside?! Because it's gettin' cold! She gets tons of catalogs and umm, she'll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that I'd like.
phoebe_buffay What else?
monica_geller When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.
rachel_green Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.
phoebe_buffay That's nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.
monica_geller When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.
rachel_green Well y'know, I don't want you to be cold.
monica_geller And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!!
rachel_green Oh, it's gonna be fine.
phoebe_buffay Okay Rachel, I can't wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! We'll have so much fun!!
rachel_green But honey, I think she's moving in with Chandler.
phoebe_buffay Oh that's right. You're still set on that?
monica_geller Kinda. Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller Hello? Hey Mon, how's the packing going? Ben? He's fine. Yeah, he's right-Oh my God! Get your head of your shirt there son! What? Yeah, it's a pumpkin. I'll come pack.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing What's wrong?
joey_tribbiani Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!
chandler_bing Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!
joey_tribbiani The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittin' Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didn't even get half a cup! Nothin'!!
chandler_bing Oh man!!
joey_tribbiani And he never played before either! Y'know what I think? I think beginner's luck, very important in Cups.
chandler_bing All right, let's play one more hand! One more!
joey_tribbiani No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! I'm serious this time! In-in fact, look, there's a-I wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, y'know, thank you for being such a great roommate.
chandler_bing I can't take the big white dog! You love it!
joey_tribbiani It's him, not it!
chandler_bing No, but wait-what if I bought it from you, y'know? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say $1,500?
joey_tribbiani Wait a second, I see what you're trying to do here! You-you're trying to give me money again!
chandler_bing When did I try to give you money?
joey_tribbiani Over there! Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!
chandler_bing I'm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that you're okay.
joey_tribbiani I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I can't take care of myself. Okay? Look, I'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that I'm gonna miss...is you. And now the dog.
monica_geller Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller I'm really gonna miss you.
rachel_green Oh! I have your key. Here you go.
monica_geller Thanks.
rachel_green Yeah.
rachel_green Oh God! This is silly, I'm gonna see you in a couple of hours!
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Bye house!
rachel_green Bye Mon.
monica_geller Bye.
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller She really left.
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller Thank you.
chandler_bing No problem roomie.
monica_geller Can I ask you a question?
chandler_bing Sure!
monica_geller What the hell is that dog doing here?!
chandler_bing I invented the game of Cups as a way to give Joey money.
dr_ross_geller And now you want that money back.
chandler_bing Exactly.
dr_ross_geller Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
chandler_bing It's not a real game! I made it up!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.
chandler_bing At a fake game!!
dr_ross_geller Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, I'd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.
chandler_bing Okay! Now I assume the Saucer card came up when you played last.
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing Hmm, let's see if it comes up this time.
