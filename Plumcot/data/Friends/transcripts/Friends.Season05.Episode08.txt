rachel_green Oh Monica that was the best Thanksgiving dinner ever! I think you killed us.
dr_ross_geller I couldn't possibly eat another bite.
joey_tribbiani I need something sweet.
phoebe_buffay Does anyone wanna watch TV?
all@ Yeah, sure.
phoebe_buffay Monica your remote doesn't work.
monica_geller Phoebe, you have to lift it and point.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Aw, forget it.
rachel_green Yeah, you know what we should all do? We should play that game where everyone says one thing that they're thankful for.
joey_tribbiani Ooh-ooh, I! I am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.
monica_geller That's very nice.
chandler_bing That's sweet, Joey.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, the other day I was at the bus-stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up. Oh! Which reminds me, I'm also thankful for thongs. (Note
joey_tribbiani I mean, it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering. I mean, it's amazing how much they can do with so little material! And the way they play with your mind! Is it there? Is it not there?
chandler_bing Are you aware that you're still talking?
monica_geller Is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?
dr_ross_geller Huh, I don't know what to pick. Am I more thankful for my divorce or my eviction? Hmm.
phoebe_buffay Wow! See, and I didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry. It's just that this is the worse Thanksgiving ever.
chandler_bing No-no-no! I am the king of bad Thanksgivings. You can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me.
rachel_green Oh, you're not gonna tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you?
dr_ross_geller Oh God, no.
joey_tribbiani Oh, come on! I wanna hear it! It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without Chandler bumming us out!
chandler_bing It's a tradition, like the parade. If the parade decided it was gay, moved out, and abandoned its entire family.
nora_tyler_bing Now Chandler dear, just because your father and I are getting a divorce it doesn't mean we don't love you. It just means he would rather sleep with the house-boy than me.
the_housekeeper More turkey Mr. Chandler?
dr_ross_geller You're right. Yours is worse. You are the king of bad Thanksgivings.
phoebe_buffay I don't know about that. I've got one that's worse.
chandler_bing Really? Worse than, "More turkey Mr. Chandler?"
phoebe_buffay Oh, did the little rich boy have a problem with the butler? Yes, mine's worse!
phoebe_buffay More bandages! More bandages! Please, can I get some more bandages in here! This man is dying - Oh no.
dr_ross_geller In this life, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse.
joey_tribbiani Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories.
phoebe_buffay Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
rachel_green I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
monica_geller Oh, let's not tell this story.
all@ Oh, come on!
phoebe_buffay Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!
rachel_green What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's not like it sounds.
chandler_bing It's exactly like it sounds.
joey_tribbiani Hello?
phoebe_buffay Hello?
joey_tribbiani Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Joey? What's going on?
joey_tribbiani Look.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani I know! It's stuck!!!
phoebe_buffay Easy. Step. How did it get on?
joey_tribbiani I put it on to scare Chandler!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Monica's gonna totally freak out!
joey_tribbiani Well then help me get it off! Plus, it smells really bad in here.
phoebe_buffay Well, of course it smells really bad. You have your head up a dead animal.
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey, did you get the turkey basted - Oh my God! Oh my God! Who is that?
joey_tribbiani It's Joey.
monica_geller What-what are you doing? Is this supposed to be funny?
phoebe_buffay No, it's not supposed to be funny, it's supposed to be scary.
monica_geller Well, get it off now!
joey_tribbiani I can't! It-it's stuck!
monica_geller Well, I don't care! That-that turkey has to feed 20 people at my parent's house and they're not gonna eat it off your head!
phoebe_buffay All right, hold on! Okay, let's just all think.
monica_geller Okay, I got it. Phoebe? All right, you pull. I'm gonna spread the legs as wide as I can. Joey? Now is not the time!
joey_tribbiani Sorry! Sorry.
monica_geller Okay, count to three. 1. 2. 3!
chandler_bing Arghhhhhh!!
joey_tribbiani It worked! I scared ya, I knew it! Ha-ha!
chandler_bing I'm over here big guy.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you are! I scared you!
chandler_bing You did look like an idiot.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot. All right? Remember when Ross tried to say, "Butternut squash?" And it came out, "Squatternut buash?"
dr_ross_geller Yeah that's the same.
monica_geller That's it. That's my worse Thanksgiving.
phoebe_buffay Oh wait! That can't be the one Rachel's talking about. She didn't even know that happened. So which one was it?
all@ Which one?
monica_geller Umm, I-I really don't want to tell this story.
chandler_bing Oh, come on Monica, reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving is all about. Y'know, for me anyway. And of course, the Indians.
monica_geller Look umm, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story!
judy_geller Monica! I think Rachel's here!
monica_geller I'll get it! Happy Thanksgiving!
rachel_green Not for me. Chip and I broke up!
monica_geller Oh, why? Why? What happened?
rachel_green Well, you know that my parents are out of town and Chip was going to come over
monica_geller Yeah, yeah, and you were going him y'know, your flower.
rachel_green Okay, Monica, can you just call it sex?! It really creeps me out when you call it that! Okay, and by the way, while we're at it, a guy's thing is not called his tenderness. Believe me! Hi!
jack_geller Hi Rachel!
rachel_green Happy Thanksgiving!
judy_geller You too sweethart!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
jack_geller Oh my!
dr_ross_geller Uh, everyone, this is Chandler! My roommate and lead singer of our band!
monica_geller Ross!
dr_ross_geller Oh, this is Monica.
monica_geller Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
chandler_bing Okay.
judy_geller I'm so glad you could come Chandler, we've got plenty of food so I hope you're hungry.
dr_ross_geller Oh, mom. Mom. Chandler hates Thanksgiving and doesn't eat any Thanksgiving food.
judy_geller Oh, well, I'm so glad you brought him here then.
monica_geller Umm, Chandler, if you want I can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.
chandler_bing Well, as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, I'm in.
monica_geller dammit!
dr_ross_geller So uh, Rach? Does it, does it feel weird around here now? Y'know since I've been away at college.
rachel_green Oh! No, not really.
dr_ross_geller Well, that's cool. So did
rachel_green Ugh! I cannot believe Chip dumped me for that slut Nancy Branson. I am never going out with him again. I don't care how much he begs!
monica_geller I think his begging days are over now that he's going out with Nancy Branson.
rachel_green Y'know what? I've just had it with high school boys! They are just silly. Silly, stupid boys! I'm going to start dating men!
dr_ross_geller Umm, I'm sorry Judy, I couldn't find that bowl that you and Jack were looking for.
monica_geller Call them mom and dad you loser!
dr_ross_geller Monica!
monica_geller Hey Chandler! Did you like the macaroni and cheese?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, it was great. You should be a chef.
monica_geller Okay!
rachel_green Guess what?! All that stuff about Nancy Branson being a slut was all a rumor so Chip dumped her and he wants to come over to my house tonight!
monica_geller Oh that's so great!
rachel_green I know!
monica_geller Oh gosh, listen if you and Chip do it tonight, promise me you'll tell me everything.
rachel_green Oh totally, totally. Y'know it's not that big of deal, we already kinda did it once y'know.
monica_geller I know, but y'know, this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it!
rachel_green I know, I know. And oh, and this time Chip promised that-that this time it will last at least for an entire song!
dr_ross_geller So I'm thinking about asking Rachel out tonight. Y'know maybe play her that song we wrote last week.
chandler_bing Emotional Knapsack?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Right on! Oh! Uh, but, don't take to long okay? 'Cause uh, we're gonna test out our fake ID's tonight, right Clifford Alverez.
dr_ross_geller Listen, Roland Chang, if things go well, I'm gonna be out with her all night.
chandler_bing Dude, don't do that too me!
dr_ross_geller All right, it's cool you can stay here. My parents won't mind.
chandler_bing No, it's not that, I just don't want to be stuck here all night with your fat sister.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
judy_geller Monica, why don't you finish off these pies? I don't have any more room left in the fridge.
monica_geller No. No, thank you!
jack_geller Well Judy, you did it! She's finally full!
chandler_bing I called you fat?! I don't even remember that!
monica_geller Well, I do.
chandler_bing I am so sorry. I really am. I was an idiot back then. I rushed the stage at a Wham concert for crying out loud!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I can't believe you called her fat.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe you let George Michael slap you.
chandler_bing I am really sorry. That is so terrible. I am so, so sorry.
rachel_green Actually, y'know that's not the Thanksgiving I was talking about.
monica_geller Yes, it was!
rachel_green No, it wasn't. It was actually the
monica_geller Okay, now Thanksgiving's over, let's get ready for Christmas. Who wants to go get a Christmas tree?!
phoebe_buffay Oh, no, I have the cutest Christmas story!
chandler_bing We wanna hear Monica's Thanksgiving story!
phoebe_buffay Fine, all right, mine had a dwarf that got broke in half, but y'know whatever.
judy_geller So Rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again.
rachel_green Oh, yeah, I had too. There was never any parking by the Psychology building.
jack_geller Hi Rachel.
rachel_green Oh hi!
jack_geller Wow, love your new nose!
judy_geller Jack.
jack_geller What? Dr. Wilson's an artist! He removed my mole cluster. Wanna see?
judy_geller I'll get it.
rachel_green No, God! Please, let me!
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey. Happy Thanksgiving!
jack_geller God, your hair sure is different!
chandler_bing Yeah, we were just talking about that. I can't believe how stupid we used to look.
dr_ross_geller So uh, where's Monica?
judy_geller She's upstairs. Monica! Come down! Everyone's here! Ross, Rachel, and the boy who hates Thanksgiving.
monica_geller Hi, Chandler.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller What-what's the matter? Is there, is there something on my dress?
chandler_bing You just, you look so different! Terrific! That dress! That body!
dr_ross_geller Dude!
chandler_bing Sorry!
judy_geller Yes, yes Monica is thin. It's wonderful. But what we really want to hear about is Ross's new girlfriend.
dr_ross_geller Oh mom! Okay, umm, her name is Carol. And she's really pretty. And smart. And uh, she's-she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team. Can you believe it? She plays for both teams!
monica_geller So Chandler, I guess I'll see you at dinner.
jack_geller Dude!
chandler_bing Sorry.
rachel_green Oh-ho, my God! That was so awesome! You totally got him back for calling you fat! He was just drooling all over you. That must've felt so great!
monica_geller Well it didn't!
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller Yeah, I mean yeah, I look great. Yeah, I feel great and yeah, my heart is not in trouble anymore! Blah, blah, blah! Y'know I still don't feel like I got him back, y'know? I just want to humiliate him. I wanna, I want him to be like naked and then I'm going to point at him and laugh!
rachel_green Okay, that we may be able to do.
monica_geller How?
rachel_green Well guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.
monica_geller What?! I mean, I didn't work this hard and-and-and lose all this weight so that I can give my flower to someone like him!
rachel_green Okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one's gonna ever take it. Then, second of all you're not actually gonna have sex with him! You're just gonna make him think that you are.
monica_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Yeah.
monica_geller And when he's naked I can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him!
rachel_green Then, you will definitely get him back!
monica_geller Okay, so how do I make him think I wanna have sex with him?
rachel_green Okay, oh, here's what you do. Just act like everything around you turns you on.
monica_geller What do you mean?
rachel_green Well, like anything can be sexy. Like umm, oh-oh, like this dishtowel! Ooh, ooh, this feels sooo good against my cheek! And-and if I feel a little hot, I can just dab myself with it. Or I can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while I talk to him.
monica_geller I can do that!
rachel_green Yeah? Okay! Good, good, because he's coming. He's coming. Hey, what's up?
chandler_bing Monica, I was wondering if you can make me some of that righteous mac and cheese like last year.
monica_geller Umm, I'd love too! Ooh, I love macaroni and cheese. I love-I love the way this box feels against my cheek.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller Boy, I love carrots! Oh! Sometimes I like to put them between my fingers like this and-and hold them down here while I talk to you. Umm, and-and-and y'know if I get really hot umm, I-I like to pick up this knife and-and umm, I-I put the cold steal against umm, my body.
chandler_bing Are you all right?
monica_geller Oh yeah, of course. I'm fine it's just that -
the_doctor What do we got here?
the_paramedic#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode08 Twenty year old has got a severed toe on his right foot.
dr_ross_geller Can you please not do that feet first? You know where his injury is! Severed toe, you just said it!
the_doctor It says here that the knife went right through your shoe.
jack_geller Of course it did. They're made of wicker.
the_doctor Did you bring the toe?
monica_geller Oh yes! I have it right here, on ice!
the_doctor Don't worry son, we'll just attach it and -
monica_geller What?! What is it?
the_doctor You brought a carrot.
chandler_bing What?
the_doctor This isn't your toe, this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.
rachel_green You brought a carrot?!
judy_geller Oh my God! There's a toe in my kitchen.
monica_geller God, I'm sorry! I'll go back and get it!
the_doctor It's too late, all we can do now is sow up the wound.
chandler_bing Without my toe?! I need my toe!
monica_geller Wait, no-no-no, I can go really fast! Dad, give me the keys to your Porsche!
jack_geller Oh, I'm not falling for that one!
chandler_bing That's why I lost my toe?! Because I called you fat?!
monica_geller I didn't mean to cut it off. It was an accident.
chandler_bing That's why for an entire year people called me Sir Limps-A-Lot?!
monica_geller I'm sorry! It wasn't your whole toe!
chandler_bing Yeah, well, I miss the tip! It's the best part. It has the nail.
monica_geller Chandler!
dr_ross_geller Sir Limps-A-Lot, I came up with that.
joey_tribbiani You're a dork.
chandler_bing I can't believe this.
monica_geller Chandler, I said I was sorry.
chandler_bing Yeah, well, sorry doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home! I hate this stupid day! And everything about it! I'll see you later.
monica_geller Oh wait, Chandler, come here is there anything I can do? Anything?
chandler_bing Yeah, just leave me alone for a while.
chandler_bing Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, "Quack, quack!" I'm happy all the time!
chandler_bing Nice try.
monica_geller Wait, wait, wait!
chandler_bing Look, Monica
monica_geller Look!
chandler_bing This is not going to work.
monica_geller I bet this will work!
chandler_bing You are so great! I love you!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
monica_geller You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
chandler_bing No I didn't!
monica_geller Yes, you did!
chandler_bing No I didn't!
monica_geller You love me!
chandler_bing No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
phoebe_buffay Gauze! Gauze! I need to get some gauze in here! Can I please get some gauze in here! Whew! This is getting ridiculous uh!
