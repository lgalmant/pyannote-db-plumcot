dr_ross_geller Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
joey_tribbiani It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!

all@ Ohh!
chandler_bing I'm so sorry you're sick.
monica_geller I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
rachel_green Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
monica_geller I have not been sick in over three years!
chandler_bing I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
monica_geller I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
dr_ross_geller When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
monica_geller I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
chandler_bing Yes?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode13 Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
rachel_green Oh my God, Jill!
jill_green Oh my God, Rachel!
chandler_bing Oh my God, introduce us!
rachel_green This is Chandler.
jill_green Hi!
rachel_green And you know Monica and Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hi Jill.
rachel_green And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey, how you doin'?
rachel_green Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
phoebe_buffay Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
jill_green Daddy cut me off.
phoebe_buffay Never mind, I got it.
jill_green And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
rachel_green Wow! What did he say?
jill_green That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
rachel_green Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
monica_geller Rach?
rachel_green Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
jill_green Okay, I bought a boat.
monica_geller You bought a boat?
jill_green Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
chandler_bing Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
rachel_green Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
phoebe_buffay Of course, yeah!
jill_green Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, I like cards.
joey_tribbiani Are you all finished here?
the_customer Yes.
joey_tribbiani Great!
gunther Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
joey_tribbiani What?!
gunther For all the free food you gave away.
joey_tribbiani Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
gunther We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
joey_tribbiani Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
gunther No!
joey_tribbiani Sorry!
jill_green I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
dr_ross_geller Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
jill_green Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
dr_ross_geller I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
jill_green Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
phoebe_buffay Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
jill_green So who made her queen of the world?
phoebe_buffay I would love that job!
rachel_green Hey! What's goin' on?
jill_green Hey!
rachel_green Jill! Did you shop?!
jill_green No! They did!
dr_ross_geller@phoebe_buffay Yeah, we went shopping!
rachel_green You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
phoebe_buffay Sorry Jill.
dr_ross_geller Sorry-sorry Jill.
rachel_green What'd you get?
phoebe_buffay Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
rachel_green Oh.
phoebe_buffay And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
rachel_green Apartment pants?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you never heard of them?
rachel_green No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
dr_ross_geller Huh? Oh, I got this--this!
rachel_green A pajmena?
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller Ross, wants a pajmena?
dr_ross_geller It's a rug.
rachel_green Jill?
jill_green I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry
rachel_green Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
jill_green Right! But, I am sorry.
rachel_green All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
jill_green She took all my stuff.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
jill_green That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
dr_ross_geller Well. Hey
jill_green Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
jill_green Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
phoebe_buffay What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
jill_green Were you this cute in high school?
dr_ross_geller Oh stop.
jill_green No you stop!
dr_ross_geller No, you stop!
jill_green You stop!
phoebe_buffay Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
monica_geller Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
chandler_bing I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
monica_geller Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
chandler_bing That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
monica_geller Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
chandler_bing Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
monica_geller Come on.
chandler_bing Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
monica_geller I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
chandler_bing That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
rachel_green What's up?!
phoebe_buffay Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
rachel_green Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
phoebe_buffay No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
rachel_green What?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
rachel_green With Ross and Jill?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green With Ross and my sister?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
rachel_green Oh there is no way.
phoebe_buffay Okay then.
rachel_green Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't-I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
phoebe_buffay But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
joey_tribbiani That'll be $3.85.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode13 What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
joey_tribbiani It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie
woman#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode13 Amy!
joey_tribbiani "...Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
the_customer Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, not it here it isn't.
jill_green Sorry I'm late, what's up?
rachel_green Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
jill_green Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
rachel_green That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
jill_green Yeah.
rachel_green Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
jill_green Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
rachel_green I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
jill_green No! I mean he's nice.
rachel_green Yeah.
jill_green He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
rachel_green Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
jill_green Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
rachel_green Are-are you saying he's a geek?
jill_green You think so too?
rachel_green No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
jill_green Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
rachel_green What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
jill_green Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
rachel_green Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
jill_green No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
rachel_green Yeah but, he's not your type.
jill_green Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
rachel_green Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
jill_green What?
rachel_green She-she died Jill.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
monica_geller Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
chandler_bing Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
monica_geller How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
chandler_bing I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
monica_geller Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
chandler_bing Would you please get some rest!
monica_geller I'm fine.
joey_tribbiani "Happy birthday to you!"

rachel_green Really?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
rachel_green Oh so-so not really never.
dr_ross_geller I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just-y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho, and mine!
monica_geller Chandler, I think I'm sick.
