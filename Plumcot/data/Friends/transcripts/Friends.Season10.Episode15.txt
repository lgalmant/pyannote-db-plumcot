chandler_bing How did the job stuff go?
rachel_green He offered me one.
dr_ross_geller You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
rachel_green The job is in Paris.
rachel_green Oh, God! Please, somebody say something.
dr_ross_geller So if you take this job you'll be moving to Paris?
chandler_bing Or facing a bitch of a commute.
rachel_green I know, it's huge, and it's scary, and it's... really far, far away from you guys, but this is such an incredible opportunity for me. And I've already talked to them about our situation with Emma, and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green I mean, I'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out... Anything we want.
chandler_bing My boss said I might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.
dr_ross_geller All right, we'll work it out.
rachel_green Thank you! Thank you!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah! You sure this is what you want?
rachel_green I think it is.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, what's going on?
rachel_green I got a really incredible job offer.
joey_tribbiani Hey, great! All right!
phoebe_buffay Good for you!
rachel_green It's in Paris.
joey_tribbiani What? No, no, no! No, no... no... no, no... No, too much is changing, okay? First, Phoebe getting married Congratulations!.. and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs...
monica_geller Hey, this afternoon you said you'd be supportive...
joey_tribbiani Well, it comes and goes. I wouldn't trust it.
rachel_green Look, you guys... this is really, really important to me. And it means a lot if you could try to get on board.
phoebe_buffay Of course we can. Congratulations. Yay! Joey...
joey_tribbiani No, no, no. My hugs are reserved for people STAYING IN AMERICA.
rachel_green Joey, it would mean so...
joey_tribbiani Hey! No! Get your France-going-arms away from me.
rachel_green Joey...
phoebe_buffay You okay with this?
chandler_bing Well, it makes me feel sad, but...
phoebe_buffay Talking to Ross.
chandler_bing I see.
dr_ross_geller Well, Rachel moving to another country? Not being able to see her every day. How can I be okay with this?
monica_geller I know, but what are we gonna do? She really needs this job.
dr_ross_geller Do you think if the Ralph Lauren people offered her her old job back, she would take it?
monica_geller How is that gonna happen?
chandler_bing Is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?
dr_ross_geller I don't know. I could talk to her boss. Yeah! I met him at that Christmas party. We really hit it off.
monica_geller You mean the guy who kept calling you Ron?
dr_ross_geller I didn't say we were brothers.
monica_geller Hey Phoebe. Hey, tell me what you think. All right. The house next door to the one that we're buying in Westchester? Just went on the market. I wanna take a look at it, but Chandler doesn't.
chandler_bing We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us, and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
monica_geller But what if it is better than ours? Should we at least look?
chandler_bing What do you think Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Well, I think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a Baskin Robbins... Anyway... Hey, isn't Joey's agent Estelle Leonard?
chandler_bing Yeah.
phoebe_buffay She died.
chandler_bing You're kidding!
monica_geller That's terrible!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, last Saturday. Wow! She was the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic. Oh, wait a minute, I read the wrong one.
chandler_bing Oh yeah?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, she was just an agent.
monica_geller Joey's gonna be 'so' upset.
chandler_bing I know. 'He' always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
phoebe_buffay Well, we cannot tell Joey about this. He's already flipping out about everything that's changing. This will push him over the edge.
monica_geller Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?
phoebe_buffay Well, not for a little while. Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.
monica_geller What if he reads it in the paper?
chandler_bing Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's. Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago.
mr_zelner Oh right, uhm, Don?
dr_ross_geller Close. Ron.
mr_zelner Uh... What can I do for you?
dr_ross_geller Uhm, well... I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back.
mr_zelner Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?
dr_ross_geller Oh, no. At first I have to get you to agree. Then we'll see if she wants to come back.
mr_zelner Wow, that is tempting.
dr_ross_geller Look, she loved her job here. And let's face it: you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it. Isn't that true?
mr_zelner She is good!
dr_ross_geller Huh, I took a shot there.
mr_zelner But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do... Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do.
dr_ross_geller I see... Thanks very much. Is this your son?
mr_zelner Yeah, his name is Ross. What?
dr_ross_geller Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron. Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
mr_zelner Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?
dr_ross_geller How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History after everyone else has left, just the two of us, and he can touch anything he wants. I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good. Let me start again. I'm a paleontologist, you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones... fossils!
mr_zelner You can really arrange that?
dr_ross_geller You let Rachel come back, and it's done.
mr_zelner Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great. Thank you so much. And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life.
mr_zelner That's great. I worry about little Ross. He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.
dr_ross_geller He'll be fine.
joey_tribbiani Hey Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Everything ok?
joey_tribbiani I'm just mad at my agent.
phoebe_buffay Estelle? Why?
joey_tribbiani There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it! She'd better have a good reason.
phoebe_buffay I'm guessing she does.
joey_tribbiani Well I'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.
phoebe_buffay Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait. All right, I gotta go. Just listen. Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her.
joey_tribbiani Ok. Why?
phoebe_buffay Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
joey_tribbiani I love that saying!
joey_tribbiani Hello?
phoebe_buffay Joey, it's Estelle.
joey_tribbiani I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
phoebeestelle#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 It's a little coincidental, but believable. Listen, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, actually I am!
phoebeestelle#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
joey_tribbiani That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball.
phoebeestelle#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are? Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?
joey_tribbiani No, no, look. All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok? And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
phoebeestelle#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 What are you saying?
joey_tribbiani I'm saying that... This isn't working for me anymore, ok? Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye.
phoebe_buffay Man, tough week for Estelle!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Hi.
dr_ross_geller Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house. You know she can't sleep without it.
rachel_green Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her.
dr_ross_geller Ok.
rachel_green Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today! Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!
dr_ross_geller Nooo!
rachel_green Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing. They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back! I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me.
dr_ross_geller So, you're not going to Paris.
rachel_green No, I'm still going.
dr_ross_geller Wh... wh...what?
rachel_green When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back, the offered me more money! Isn't that great?
dr_ross_geller Yeeeah!
lady#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now, but please, look around.
monica_geller Thanks.
chandler_bing It feels like we're cheating on our house. And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot, younger house, that does stuff that our house won't do?
monica_geller Ours is so much better! This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave! What a hole!
lady#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 So? What do you think?
monica_geller Love it!
lady#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 Well, we already have one offer on it, and I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one.
monica_geller They could be our neighbors, what are they like?
lady#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice. She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she...
janice Oh my God!
chandler_bing Sure.
phoebe_buffay Hey Joey, want come with me to... are you ok?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I just... I just feel bad about firing Estelle. This is got to be killing her.
phoebe_buffay No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might.
joey_tribbiani I don't know. She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client. Except for this guy who eats paper. And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes. Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years. I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
phoebe_buffay No, no, no! Don't call her! You wait for her to call you
joey_tribbiani Why?
phoebe_buffay Because patience is the road to understanding which.. is the key... to a happy heart.
joey_tribbiani You blow me away.
phoebe_buffay All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?
joey_tribbiani I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason.
chandler_bing And yet I never run into Beyonce!
realtor#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 You two know each other?
janice Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him, Chandler used to be my little love muffin! So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too? Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war? I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie
chandler_bing Don't, don't!
monica_geller No, actually, we're buying the house next door.
chandler_bing Why!?
monica_geller I don't know why.
janice Ooh, that decides it then. I was on the fence. But knowing that you two would be our neighbors? Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers.
chandler_bing This can not be happening!
monica_geller Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer. Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
chandler_bing The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers.
monica_geller Okay, Okay, All right. What if we got both houses? Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house.
chandler_bing That is a great idea! And by the way, I don't mean to sound distasteful, but when did you start crapping money!?
monica_geller Okay, you come up with an idea.
chandler_bing Alright alright, we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house. We can still get out.
monica_geller But we love our house.
chandler_bing Will we love it so much with her next door? And she's gonna be louder out here too. Just the crickets and "Oh My God"!
monica_geller Okay, but if we don't get this house, she's stil gonna show up wherever we go! I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of suprise. I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
chandler_bing Well, we have to do something. We can't have her living next door. Oh, that does it too.
mr_zelner Who is it?
dr_ross_geller It's me. Ron. Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
mr_zelner This may surprise you, but re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job.
dr_ross_geller Just hear me out. How would you feel about offering her a raise?
mr_zelner Not good, Ron.
dr_ross_geller Perhaps I can persuade you. What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
mr_zelner Wow, that's pretty cool
dr_ross_geller Huh? So? We have a deal?
mr_zelner Okay, you got it.
dr_ross_geller Yes! yes!
mr_zelner This is gonna make me very popular.
dr_ross_geller Oh, Believe me, the ladies, they love it!
mr_zelner I meant with my son.
dr_ross_geller Good, 'cause the ladies, not so much.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God. Hello?
phoebe_buffay Joey, it's Estelle.
joey_tribbiani Estelle?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.
joey_tribbiani Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?
phoebe_buffay Well, I didn't think I should just drop by...
joey_tribbiani No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!
phoebe_buffay Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay.
joey_tribbiani Can I ask you something? Uhm, what's it like there?
phoebe_buffay It's alright. Look kiddo, I gotta go. Good luck with the career. You're gonna be huge.
joey_tribbiani Thanks for everything Estelle. Bye. "out of area". Boy, I'll say.
chandler_bing The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
janice All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye. And... I'll see you later, neighbor.
chandler_bing Wait! I just want you to know that... I'm so happy you're going to be here.
janice Oh, me too...
chandler_bing Because... that way... we can pick up where we left off.
janice Huh?
chandler_bing I never stopped loving you.
janice Oh... my...
chandler_bing Yeah, yeah, yeah! I want you... I need you... I must have you Janice Litman Goralnik Neihosenstein.
janice Chandler, what are you talking about?
chandler_bing Now that you live next door, we can be together every day. Sid and Monica never have to know a thing.
janice I don't know what to say... I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us.
chandler_bing Obviously.
janice But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife. Now, I don't think we should get this house now.
chandler_bing Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
janice Chandler, one of us has got to be strong.
chandler_bing I understand.
janice Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness... Goodbye Chandler Bing.
chandler_bing They're never coming down now.
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
dr_ross_geller They did?
rachel_green Yeah. It was the weirdest thing. Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back. And that I should thank some Ron... I don't even know what department that guy's in.
dr_ross_geller So, what are you gonna do?
rachel_green Well, I took it.
dr_ross_geller That's great! So you're staying in New York!
both#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode15 YAY! WHOO! YAY!
dr_ross_geller You're excited, right?
rachel_green Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great. It's certainly the easier choice...
dr_ross_geller Right!
rachel_green Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris? Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world? Ooh, absolutely... Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine. I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
dr_ross_geller Uhm, I hadn't no you... I had no idea you were so excited about Paris. Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared.
rachel_green Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know? Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared. Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared... But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
dr_ross_geller You should go.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller It's what you want. You should go.
rachel_green You really think so?
dr_ross_geller I really do.
rachel_green But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
dr_ross_geller I'm sure he'll understand.
rachel_green All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna go to Paris.
dr_ross_geller Yeah...
rachel_green Yeah! I'm going to Paris. Thank you, Ross!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, oh!
rachel_green Oh! Oh, I'm so happy.
dr_ross_geller Then I'm happy too.
joey_tribbiani Thank you all for coming. We're here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman...inside. As Estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words. Dude, where's my speech? That is entertaining. Al Zebooker everybody.
