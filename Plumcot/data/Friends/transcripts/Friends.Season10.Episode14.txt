mike_hannigan Thank you guys for having us over.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Yeah, this is fun, couples night.
chandler_bing Yeah, I don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.
monica_geller Well, because every time we do, you make jokes about swinging and scare them away.
chandler_bing You mean that Portuguese couple? Yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.
dr_ross_geller Hey, you guys... I have great news.
monica_geller Ross, we're kind of in the middle of diner here.
dr_ross_geller Oh, well, er, I already ate, but sure...! Guess what happened at work today...
chandler_bing A dinosaur died a million years ago?
dr_ross_geller Try sixty-five million years ago, and then try sssshhhhhh.... My tenure review board met today and I hear it's looking really good.
phoebe_buffay Wow!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Do you have any idea what this means in academic circles, uh? I am gonna get laid.
rachel_green Hi you guys.
all@ Hey.
rachel_green Ooh, Italian!
monica_geller No one wanted seconds, right?
dr_ross_geller No, no. I-I'm good.
rachel_green Hey you guys... You're never gonna believe it. This headhunter called me. I have a meeting tomorrow with Gucci. Gucci wants me.
dr_ross_geller I'm up for tenure.
rachel_green Congratulations!
dr_ross_geller You too! What are the odds?
rachel_green Ooh!
joey_tribbiani Guess what? I finally got that seed out of my teeth.
monica_geller I don't know who I'm happiest for...
phoebe_buffay I do, he's been working on that all day!
phoebe_buffay Hey Mon? Was it weird changing your name to Geller-Bing?
monica_geller No, no. It felt nice to acknowledge this.
phoebe_buffay Where did you go to do it?
monica_geller Uhm the... the ministry... of names... bureau...
chandler_bing YOU NEVER DID IT!
monica_geller I'm sorry. It's just the idea of being an official Bing.
chandler_bing Hey! I will have you know that... aah, who am I kidding. Let's call the kid Geller and let Bing die with me.
mike_hannigan Here you go.
phoebe_buffay Thanks! Honey, would you want me to take your name?
mike_hannigan Oh, it's just... It's up to you. It's your name. You've got to live with it.
phoebe_buffay All right, let's see, call me mrs Hannigan.
chandler_bing Mrs Hannigan?
phoebe_buffay What? Can't you see I'm in the middle of something? Ooh, I like it.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys.
chandler_bing Hey Joe! We've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. You want to come with us?
joey_tribbiani No, thank you.
monica_geller All right. I know you're not happy about us moving, but you're the only one who hasn't seen the house.
chandler_bing Yeah, come with us. You'll see how close it is to the city.
joey_tribbiani But no, it's not close. You said it was in escrow? I couldn't even find it on the map.
monica_geller Joey, please come. It would mean so much to us.
joey_tribbiani You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!
chandler_bing Damn it.
monica_geller See you guys later.
phoebe_buffay Okay!
monica_geller I'll pick you up at eleven. So glad you're coming.
phoebe_buffay Good for you. That was really mature.
joey_tribbiani What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here.
mike_hannigan You're a strange kind of grown-up.
phoebe_buffay Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just...
mike_hannigan Woo-wo-hey-hey-hey... Can we not talk about that right now?
phoebe_buffay All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey... I can convince people to do anything, you know. I bet I can even get Mike to do that "thing". What is it?
joey_tribbiani I AM NOT GONNA HELP YOU DO THAT! Goodbye!
rachel_green Hi, I'm here to see mr Campbell... with Gucci. The reservation is probably under Gucci. It's spelled like Gukki, which could be confusing.
the_maitre_d Mr Campbell's not here yet. Let me show you to his table.
rachel_green Oh my God! That's my boss. You have to seat us somewhere else.
the_maitre_d I'm sorry. That's always mr Campbell's table.
rachel_green But my... but my boss cannot see me. I'm interviewing for another job.
the_maitre_d I know. With Gukki
rachel_green Sssshhhh!
mr_zelner Rachel?
rachel_green Hi... I'm on a date...
mr_zelner That's great!
rachel_green Yeah, it is. Yeah, you know, it's tough. Single mom, career... You gotta get out there.
mr_zelner Well, you got uhm... good energy.
rachel_green Oh.
james_campbell Rachel?
rachel_green Yes, hi!
james_campbell James Campbell...
rachel_green Hi! Excuse us.
james_campbell Please...
rachel_green Okay. Oh, yeah... Oh he's cute!
james_campbell So... your resumé is quite impressive.
rachel_green Wha... My resumé? I wouldn't... I wouldn't call my online dating profile a resumé.
james_campbell Dating profile? I-I-I'm talking about the work resumé.
rachel_green Whatever happened to just singing for no reason? Huh?
james_campbell Maybe people... found it weird.... So, why do you want to leave Ralph Lauren?
rachel_green What? I-I don't.
james_campbell You don't?
rachel_green No, I-I-I love it there.
james_campbell Well, if you don't want to leave, why are we having this lunch?
james_campbell What?
james_campbell That's Hugo Boss?
phoebe_buffay This place is so depressing. If I had to work here I'd kill myself. But you obviously haven't.
the_clerk How can I help you?
phoebe_buffay I need to change my name, please. See, I need to change it because I'm-I'm hiding from the law. You're fun.
the_clerk You need to fill out this form.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?
the_clerk It can be anything you want.
phoebe_buffay Well, not anything, I mean...
the_clerk Yeah... anything.
phoebe_buffay Oh, this could take a while.
the_clerk Get out of my line.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Oh, not anymore. I changed it today.
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry, mrs Hannigan.
phoebe_buffay Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock.
chandler_bing That's what we were gonna name the baby.
monica_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Uh! Princess Consuela.
monica_geller You seriously changed your name to that?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh!
monica_geller Okay, so from now on we have to call you Princess Consuela?
phoebe_buffay Uhm, no. I'm gonna have my friends call me Valerie.
chandler_bing Hey, how'd the interview go?
rachel_green Oh! It's not good.
chandler_bing You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think.
rachel_green Well, I didn't get the job at Gucci and I got fired from Ralph Lauren.
chandler_bing That is a bad interview.
phoebe_buffay What are you, what are you talking about? How did this happen?
rachel_green Well, my boss was at the same restaurant where I was having my interview and he heard everything. So later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he's gonna have to let me go, because I'm not a team player. And I said "Wait a minute! Yes I am." and I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact... was true.
monica_geller Oh God. I'm so sorry.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Wha-hoo! What's this? Well it's a, it's a bottle of champagne. Why is this here?
phoebe_buffay Ross...
dr_ross_geller I guess it's here because I GOT TENURE!
all@ Congratulations!
dr_ross_geller This is the single greatest day of my professional career. Gunther, six glasses!
gunther Six? You want me to join you?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I thought Joey was here. Five is good. Well, I'm gonna have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow.
chandler_bing Ooh! Israeli champagne. And it's vanilla!
dr_ross_geller I got tenure. I didn't win the lottery... Hey Rach, so uh... how did your thing go?
rachel_green Oh it... good! Yeah, but I'm not gonna hear from that for a couple of days.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you know what? You're gonna get it. I-I-I-I can feel it.
phoebe_buffay Can you?
rachel_green Ah, all right. Here's to Ross!
dr_ross_geller And-and to years of hard work finally paying off.
phoebe_buffay And to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.
dr_ross_geller But also knowing it means a lot.
monica_geller But more importantly to full well-rounded lives.
dr_ross_geller ..that center around work.
chandler_bing To Ross!
all@ Ross!
dr_ross_geller You know what the best part about this is? I can never be fired.
phoebe_buffay Oh God!
dr_ross_geller No seriously. I have job security for life. You know, I never have to worry. Oh, look at you. Look how happy you are for me.
rachel_green No, it's not that. I got fired today. And I didn't get the other job.
dr_ross_geller Rach, I'm so sorry.
rachel_green Oh!
dr_ross_geller Great. I feel like an idiot.
rachel_green No, it's okay, you didn't know.
dr_ross_geller Oh... Little heads-up would have been nice.
monica_geller Thank you for letting us see the house again.
chandler_bing And thank you for explaining to us what escrow means... I've already forgotten what you said, but thank you.
the_realtor Take as long as you want. Just let me know when you're through.
monica_geller Ah, so glad you decided to come.
joey_tribbiani Me too. Yeah, this place is great. I'm so happy for you guys. Although, you know, I hope you like fungus.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Fungus! Yeah. Place is full of it.
monica_geller No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything.
joey_tribbiani Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.
monica_geller Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here.
joey_tribbiani Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark.
monica_geller No it's not!
joey_tribbiani Are you kiddin'? I think I just saw a bat in the corner!
chandler_bing When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?
joey_tribbiani Maybe. Well, I just think you guys can do better than this house, you know? Or any other house for that matter.
monica_geller Oh Joey, look, we know you're having a hard time with this, but we really, we love it here.
joey_tribbiani FINE, ok, if you love this house so much, then you should just live here, okay? I just hope you get used to that weird humming sound. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
monica_geller Joey, we know that's you.
joey_tribbiani no... hmmmmm... it's not... hmmmmmmmmmm
mike_hannigan Hey

phoebe_buffay Yep.

phoebe_buffay Why? It's fun, it's different, no-one else has a name like it.
mike_hannigan Alright, then I'm gonna change my name.
phoebe_buffay Great, okay, what are you gonna change it to?
mike_hannigan Crap Bag.
phoebe_buffay Mike Crap Bag?
mike_hannigan No, no Mike, just Crap Bag. First name Crap, last name Bag.
phoebe_buffay You're not serious, right?
mike_hannigan Yeah, I'm serious. It's fun, it's different and no-one else has a name like that!
phoebe_buffay Uhu, uhu, well, then, great. If you love it, I love it.
mike_hannigan I do love it, and I love your name. I love Princess Consuela.

joey_tribbiani Oh, hi, I'm Joey. My stupid friends are buying this house. Who are you?

joey_tribbiani Oh.

joey_tribbiani I hate my friends. Alright, look. There's gotta be a way that we can stop this from happening.
mackenzie Like what?
joey_tribbiani Uhm... oh! Okay. You come with me, and you tell them that the house is haunted!
mackenzie What are you? Eight?
joey_tribbiani Woah, uh! Okay, let's hear your great idea.
mackenzie I don't have any great ideas. I am eight.
joey_tribbiani Ahh! There's gotta be a way. I mean, you know, if Monica and Chandler move out here and now Phoebe is married to Mike. That just leaves me and Ross and Rach, you know what I mean?
mackenzie I really don't.
joey_tribbiani What am I gonna do, I feel like I'm losing my friends.
mackenzie My parents say I'm gonna make new friends.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, sure, easy for you, you're young. Me, I'm set in my ways.
mackenzie This is what my mom was talking about. Whiners are wieners. Look, you want your friends to be happy, right?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah, I guess.
mackenzie Well, if moving here is gonna make them happy, don't you want them to do it?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, maybe.
mackenzie Then you gotta let them go.
joey_tribbiani I hate to admit it, but you're probably right. How did you get to be so smart?
mackenzie I read a lot.
joey_tribbiani Just when I thought we could be friends.
man#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode14 Hey Rach, I just heard. I'm so sorry.
rachel_green Oh, thank you...

rachel_green Well, now I don't have to.
rachel_green Ross, what is taking you so long?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, it's almost as if this wasn't built for a quick getaway!
mark_robinson Rachel?
rachel_green Mark? Oh my God!
mark_robinson How've you been?
rachel_green I'm fantastic. You remember Ross?
mark_robinson Sure, sure. What's with the chair.
dr_ross_geller Uh, you know, you can't always get a seat on the subway, so...
mark_robinson Clever. So how are you?
rachel_green Oh, well, you're not catching me on my best day.
mark_robinson Yeah, a box full of your desk stuff doesn't exactly say big promotion.
rachel_green No, but it's good, you know, I'm gonna take some time off and do some charity work.
mark_robinson Are you sure, because we may have something at Louis Vuitton.
rachel_green Well, screw charity work. What've you got?
mark_robinson Why don't we have dinner tonight and talk about it?
rachel_green Great! I'll call ya!
mark_robinson Nice to see you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah! yeah, I got tenure!
rachel_green Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller See? I told you something good would come along. And he seemed really nice. I've met him before?
rachel_green Ross! That's Mark. From Bloomingdales? You were insanely jealous of him.
dr_ross_geller That is Mark?
rachel_green Yes.
dr_ross_geller I hate that guy.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller No, no, NO, you cannot go to dinner with him.
rachel_green What? You don't want me to get a job?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, I'm sure he's gonna give you a job. Maybe make you his SEXretary.
rachel_green Ugh.
dr_ross_geller I'm serious. I just don't trust that guy, okay?
rachel_green Ross, you know what? Okay, let's talk about it later, there comes security.
monica_geller Oh, I love this street. The trees, the big front yards, the actual picket fences.
chandler_bing Man, those two dogs are going at it!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Hey, where have you been?
joey_tribbiani Oh, just er... you know, looking around. But you know what? This house... is great.
chandler_bing Really? What changed your mind?
joey_tribbiani Oh well, the little girl who lives here made me feel a lot better about the whole thing.
chandler_bing Joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Ha! I'm just messing with you.
joey_tribbiani That's not funny! You know I'm afraid of little girl ghosts!
monica_geller Joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you wanna go see your room?
joey_tribbiani What? I get my own room?
chandler_bing You don't think we'd buy a house and not have a Joey room do you?
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! Oh! Hey, can I have an aquarium? And a sex swing?
chandler_bing@monica_geller No!
joey_tribbiani Why not? I'll keep the tank clean.
mike_hannigan After you, miss Banana Hammock.

phoebe_buffay Yeah.
mike_hannigan Why don't you tell her my name?
phoebe_buffay Okay, I will. This is my husband Crap Bag.
rita Crap Bag?
mike_hannigan If you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.
rita Okay. Excuse me...
phoebe_buffay Yeah... Ogh... Okay, fine. You made your point. Can you please just be Mike Hannigan again?
mike_hannigan Only if you'll be Phoebe Buffay.
phoebe_buffay How about uhm... How about Buffay-Hannigan?
mike_hannigan Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I'm Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan Banana Hammock.
mike_hannigan Do you even know what a banana hammock is?
phoebe_buffay It's a funny word.
mike_hannigan It's a Speedo.
phoebe_buffay ..Oh crap!
dr_ross_geller Hey, is Rachel here?
monica_geller No.
dr_ross_geller She's still at dinner?
monica_geller I guess. Why? Who's she with?
dr_ross_geller That guy Mark. From Bloomingdale's... She thinks he's just being nice to her. But I know he really wants to sleep with her.
chandler_bing It's seven years ago. My time machine works!
dr_ross_geller We ran into him on the street today and he said he might have a job for her. But I know he just wants to get into her pants.
monica_geller So what if he wants to sleep with her? I mean, she's single and he's cute.
chandler_bing Excuse me?
monica_geller Oh please! Yesterday on the subway? You couldn't stop staring at that woman with the big breasts the whole time.
chandler_bing For your information, I was staring at her baby. We're about to be parents.
monica_geller Oh, sorry!
rachel_green Hi you guys!
dr_ross_geller Hey, so uhm... How was dinner?
rachel_green Oh, it was great. Mark is so sweet.
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah? Yeah? I wonder why? What could that smarmy letch possibly want?
rachel_green Oh Ross, come on. He's happily married. His wife just had twins.
dr_ross_geller Should we send something?
chandler_bing How did the job stuff go?
rachel_green He offered me one.
chandler_bing That's great!
dr_ross_geller Congratulations!
rachel_green I know, it's amazing. It's amazing. It's so much better than what I had at Ralph Lauren. The money is great...
dr_ross_geller Can we, can we just stop for a second? Who said something better would come along, huh? You didn't believe me. I told you everything was gonna work out. You know what? This calls for a bottle of Israels finest.
rachel_green The job is in Paris.
joey_tribbiani I mean, this soap opera is a great gig, but... am I missing opportunities? You know, I've always thought of myself as a serious actor. I mean, should I be trying to do more independent movies?
mackenzie I don't know... You know what? I'm gonna put you on with my bear. Hold on.
joey_tribbiani Hey bear, I need some career advice.
