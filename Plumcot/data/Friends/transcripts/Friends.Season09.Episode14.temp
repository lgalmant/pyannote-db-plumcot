joey Morning, roomie!
rachel Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.
joey Fifth day's a charm.
rachel Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.
joey Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?
ross Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?
rachel Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...
joey She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.
rachel Bye!
ross Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.
joey No, hey, it's been great.
ross Yeah?
joey Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...
ross Yeah, that'll do it.
joey Wow! So, how are you?
ross I'm, I'm okay.
joey Really?
ross Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.
joey Well, actually it...
ross No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.
joey Wow, really?
ross Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...
joey Sure, I know lots of girls.
ross Yeah? Any names come to mind?
joey Ooh, names?
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?
phoebe What you got?
joey Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.
phoebe Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.
joey I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.
phoebe Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.
joey Why are they doing this?
phoebe I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.
joey You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?
phoebe I just wish they'd realise they should be together.
joey I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.
phoebe I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.
joey Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.
phoebe You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.
joey Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.
phoebe So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?
joey I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.
phoebe Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.
joey Ooh, that's a great plan!
phoebe Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my "plan-laugh."
joey Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...
rachel Hey!
monica Hey!
rachel You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?
chandler See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.
rachel I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.
monica Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?
rachel Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.
monica Oh my god.
chandler Wow.
rachel Why? What's the big deal?
monica Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...
rachel What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.
chandler Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!
monica You want a job? Turn off "Oprah," and send out a resume!
rachel So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?
monica Oh, it's perfect.
rachel Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!
chandler Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.
phoebe Ooh, Joey.
joey Hey.
phoebe Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.
joey All right! Who is he?
phoebe Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.
joey Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.
phoebe Oh, yeah.
joey She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!
phoebe A teacher?
joey Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?
phoebe Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!
joey Oh my god, you're right!
phoebe Yeah.
joey She even reads for pleasure!
phoebe How do you even know a woman like that?
joey What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?
phoebe Joey.
joey I met her at the library. I went in to pee.
phoebe So now what do we do?
joey Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.
phoebe What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!
joey Ooh...I hear that's bad.
phoebe Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.
joey Ah, yes, The Plan!
phoebe It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...
joey Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.
phoebe No, I think we killed it.
chandler Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.
chandler No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!
monica Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.
chandler I don't do that.
chandler I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?
monica Yeah.
chandler Today is the sixth.
monica No, it's not.
chandler Yes, it's also 2003.
monica Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.
chandler It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.
monica Okay.
chandler Tough crib.
monica Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.
chandler I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.
monica Chandler!
chandler I am not working. There's not much to do around here!
ross Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?
waiter Uh, there's a drunk Chinese guy.
ross Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.
waiter Can I get you another glass of wine?
ross Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.
waiter Got stood up, huh?
ross Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.
waiter Are you worried your date came, saw you, and left?
ross No!
monica We're okay. I'm still ovulating.
chandler Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.
monica So, let's do this.
chandler I - I don't think I can.
monica Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.
chandler Because of Emma.
monica Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.
chandler Sorry.
monica Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?
chandler Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.
monica Canoodling?
chandler Well, I can't say "hump" or "screw" in front of the B-A-B-Y.
monica I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...
chandler Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?
monica I guess you're right.
chandler You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.
monica But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?
rachel Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.
steve I - I just have to say this; you're really beautiful.
rachel Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.
steve I'm kind of funny looking.
rachel What?
steve Oh, come on, you're way out of my league. Everybody in here knows it. Bet that guy over there's probably saying, "ooh, why she out with him? He must be rich!" Well, I'm not!
rachel So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.
steve I'm not funny either. So, if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking, but maybe we'll have some laughs"... That ain't gonna happen.
rachel Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.
steve I lost it. To drugs.
steve I silk-screen t-shirts now.
rachel Really? What's that like?
steve It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile.
rachel Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.
steve I do like my hair.
rachel Really?
phoebe Hello?
rachel Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!
phoebe Hey, Rach!
rachel This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?
phoebe You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.
rachel I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!
phoebe Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.
rachel He's not stoned.
phoebe Did he go out for a cigarette?
rachel Yeah, four times.
phoebe My dear, sweet Rach.
phoebe Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.
joey Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.
phoebe By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.
monica She's asleep. Chandler?
monica What are you doing?
chandler Emma was doing it!
monica She's asleep.
chandler Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...
monica Yes, but we have to be fast.
chandler Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.
monica Okay, I'll try.
joey Hello?
joey Emma? Hey! Hi!
joey How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?
joey You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!
waiter I've got bad news. The Chinese guy left.
ross Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.
waiter Look; you got stood up, who cares? We're gonna show you a good time. Just sit and relax. In fact, let me bring you a crab cake appetizer on the house.
ross Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.
waiter Ooh...
ross Just the crab cakes.
waiter_2 What are you doing? Are you trying to get him to stay? Because you can't do that.
waiter Just get out of here, okay?
ross What's - what's going on?
waiter Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.
ross What? You - you're making money off my misery?
waiter Well, if you stay till 9:20, I am.
ross This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.
monica Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.
chandler I think we may have really done it this time.
monica Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.
chandler You may wanna get some more of those too.
chandler Where's Emma?
monica Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?
chandler Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!
monica Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.
chandler Okay.
monica Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.
steve I - I can't believe I'm crying in front of you. You must think I'm so pathetic.
rachel No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.
steve Really?
rachel Don't touch my coat!
rachel Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?
monica Hey, Rach, how's it going?
rachel Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!
rachel Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?
monica Hey, did you stop by here?
rachel No.
monica Oh my god, then...
monica Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!
rachel What? What do you mean, "there you are"? Where was she?
monica Oh, we were playing "peek-a-boo." She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.
monica Why the hell did you take her?
joey Because you two were having sex!
monica No, we weren't!
joey Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?
chandler All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.
joey Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.
chandler No, no, no.
monica No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!
joey Hey, I gotta! Unless...
monica Unless what?
joey Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.
chandler What? Why?
joey Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.
chandler Your family name is Tribbiani.
joey You almost had me.
rachel Well, uh...
steve Look, I think I know the answer to this question, but... Would you like to make love to me?
rachel Really, really not.
steve Eh, it's just as well. Doesn't work anyway.
rachel All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.
ross Hey, what's wrong?
rachel I just had a rough night.
ross Oh. Crab cake?
rachel Eww!
ross Well, what happened?
rachel Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...
ross Monica told me you had a blind date.
rachel Yeah.
ross I did, too.
rachel Oh.
ross But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?
rachel Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?
ross Why does everyone keep saying that?
rachel Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.
ross That bad?
rachel Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.
ross Female body inspector? What size is that?
phoebe Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?
joey Uh-huh.
phoebe How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?
joey It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.
phoebe Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.
phoebe Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.
phoebe Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.
ross The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.
rachel Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.
ross Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.
joey We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.
phoebe Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.
phoebe Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!
joey Where?
phoebe Mexico!
joey Can you believe they're still not here?
ross I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?
joey I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?
waiter What?
joey We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.
waiter Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.
steve I have such fat hands!
