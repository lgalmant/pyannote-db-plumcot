rachel_green I'm sorry, what?
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller Excuse me?
joey_tribbiani It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.
chandler_bing Oh, ok.
joey_tribbiani There's my scene, there's my scene. "Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..."

This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Chandler: Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into show business. Joey: Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me! Ross: You're right, you're right, it is.

phoebe_buffay I can't! My circuits are fried! They're fried I tell you!!
joey_tribbiani Wow! Well then I'll just have to carry you.
dr_ross_geller That'll be a neat trick, when you're, when you're dead!
joey_tribbiani Ross, you don't have to yell.
dr_ross_geller There was just an explosion, okay? My hearing would be impaired.
phoebe_buffay I thought you were excellent! In fact for a minute there I was like, "Ooh, where'd Ross go?"
dr_ross_geller Thank you! And I have to say that first scene when you meet Mac
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
