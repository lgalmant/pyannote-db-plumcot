joey Okay, pick a card, any card. All right, now memorize it. Show to everybody. Got it?
monica Um-mm.
joey All right, give it back to me. 5 of hearts.
ross Real magic does exist.
rachel Wow.
monica Wow. Joey, how do you do it?
joey I can't tell you that, no.
ross Ah, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.
rachel Noo, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.
monica He took up the carpet, and now you can hear everything.
phoebe Why don't you go up there and ask him to 'step lightly, please?'
monica I have like five times, but the guy is so charming, that I go up there to yell and then I end up apologizing to him.
phoebe Ooh, that is silly. I'll go up there, I'll tell him to keep it down.
monica All right, be my guest.
rachel Good luck.
joey All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, you really wanna know how I did it, I'll show ya. When you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was, I looked at it so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye. I just did it. I just did it, again. Here, I'll slow it down so that you guys can see it.
all Oh, I got it.
phoebe Yeah, look I was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do, and I am sick and tired...
guy Whoa, you are very beautiful.
phoebe Oh, thank you.
chandler Hey, anybody got a length of rope about six feet long with a little nouse at the end?
monica Honey, what's the matter?
chandler I just saw Janice.
all Oh.
chandler Yeah, she was at Rockefeller Center skating with her husband, she looked so happy. I almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
joey Man, I remember the first time I saw that girl Katherine, after we broke up. She was just walking with her friend Donna, just laughing and talking. God, it killed me.
chandler Yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.
joey Sorry, I just, any excuse to tell that story y'know....
ross Hey Chandler, there's a party tomorrow, you'll feel better then.
chandler Oh, y'know what, I'm gonna be okay, you don't have to throw a party for me.
monica It's Joey's birthday.
chandler Oh, well then, if anybody should have a party it should be him.
monica Sush!! I cannot believe she is still up there.
chandler Okay, well he totally screwed up the punch line. Y'know, it's supposed to be arrghh-eh og-errigh.
mr_kaplan How's that coffee comin,' dear?
rachel Yeah, right away Mr. Kaplan.
mr_kaplan I'm not supposed to drink coffee, it makes me gassy.
rachel I know!
mr_kaplan I'll bet your thinking, 'What's an intelligent girl who wants to be in fashion, doing making coffee?' Eh?
rachel Op.
mr_kaplan Eh.
rachel Oh, you got me.
mr_kaplan Well, don't think I haven't noticed your potential. Well, I've got a project for you that's a lot more related to fashion. How does that sound?
rachel Oh, that sounds great.
mr_kaplan Come on over here, sweetheart.
rachel Oh thank you so much Mr. Kaplan, thank you so much.
mr_kaplan I need these hangers separated ASAP. You're welcome.
rachel Oh God, I hate my job, I hate it, I hate my job, I hate it.
monica I know honey, I'm sorry.
rachel Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.
monica Gee, I don't know Rach. Order up!! I got a Yentel soup, a James Beans, and a Howdy hold the Dowdy!
rachel Oh honey, come on, I'm sorry, I didn't.... I don't mind paying my dues, y'know, its just how much am I gonna learn about fashion by walking Mira, the arthritic seamstress, to the bathroom.
rachel Hi! Is my misery amusing to you?
guy I'm sorry, I wa, I wa, I was just ah....
rachel It's not funny, this is actually my job.
guy Oh believe me, I-I-I've been there. I had to sort mannequin heads at that Mannequins Plus.
rachel Oh well then, so I'm just going to go back to talking to my friend here. And you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.
guy Ah, just one other thing.
rachel Yes?!
guy I ah, I work at Bloomingdale's and I might know of a job possibility if your, if your interested?
rachel Do you want my pickle?
gunther Hey guys.
monica Hey Gunther. Hi. I mean you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?
phoebe Well, he's very charming.
monica I know, he's too charming, but if you two start going out, then it's just gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.
phoebe Well, you're just gonna have to try.
monica Joey, where are the Jell-o shots?
joey I don't know, Chandler is supposed to be passin' 'em around...
joey Chandler!
chandler Hello-dillillio!!
ross Oh, somebody's feeling better.
monica Stick out your tongue.
chandler Take off your shirt!
monica Oh my!!
joey Oh my God! How many of these things did you have? These are pure vodka.
chandler Yeah, Jell-o just like Mom used to make.
rachel The most unbelievable thing happened to me today.
ross Hi!
rachel Hi! So I'm out having lunch at Monica's and this guy starts talking to me, and it turns out he works for a buyer at Bloomingdale's and there happens to be an opening in his department. So I gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview!
ross Wow!
rachel I know!
ross What, so this guy is helping you for no apparent reason?
rachel Uh-huh!
ross And he's, he's a total stranger?
rachel Yeah! His name is um, Mark something.
ross Huh. Sounds like Mark Something wants to have some sex.
rachel What!?
ross Well, I'm just saying, I mean why else would he just, y'know, swoop in out of nowhere for no reason.
rachel To be nice.
ross Hey, Joey. Are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?
joey No, only for sex.
ross Thank you. So did you ah, did you tell Mark Something about me?
rachel I didn't have to, because I was wearing my 'I heart Ross' sandwich board and ringing my bell.
ross Uh-huh.
joeys_sisters Joey!!! Happy Birthday!!
joey Hey!! Hey-hey-hey!
chandler Okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?
monica How hammered are you? Huh? These, these are Joey's sisters.
chandler Hi Joey's sisters!
phoebe Hey!
cookie Hey. What are we drinkin' over here.
phoebe Well, I have ah, vodka and cranberry juice.
cookie No kiddin,' that's the exact same drink I made myself right after I shot my husband.
phoebe Wow. Okay, I don't know how to talk to you.
sister_1 What 'cha doing?
chandler Oh, I'm taking my ex-girlfriend of my speed dialer.
joeys_sisters Oh!!
chandler No-no-no-no, no, it's a good thing. Why must we dial so speedily anyway? Why must we rush through life? Why can't we savor the precious moments? Those are some huge breasts you have.
ross Hi.
monica Hi.
ross Yeah. So um, I-I heard about this ah, Mark guy that ah, Rachel met today.
monica Isn't that great?
ross Oh yeah! So ah, kinda pretty, pretty good. He sounds like a nice, good guy.
monica Oh, he is. And he is so dreamy. I mean, y'know what, when he left I actually used the phrase, 'Hummina-hummina-hummina.'
ross That's excellent.
ross So, he's just a nice guy. You really think this Mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping him?
rachel Well, I assume I'll have to take showers with him, but y'know, that's true of any job.
monica How ya feelin'?
chandler Well, my apartment isn't there anymore, because I drank it.
phoebe Where'd you get too? We lost you after you opened up all the presents.
ross Yeah.
chandler Yeah, I ended up in the storage room, and not alone.
all Woooo hoooo!!!
chandler Ow, no 'woo-hooing,' no 'woo-hooing.'
phoebe Why, what happened?
chandler Ah, I fooled around with Joey's sister. Well, that's not the worst part.
monica What is the worse part?
chandler I can't remember which sister.
ross You see what men do! Don't tell me men are not nice! This is men!!
monica Are you insane? I mean Joey, is going to kill you, he's actually going to kill you dead.
chandler Okay! You don't think I thought of that?
phoebe How can you not know which one?
rachel I mean that's unbelievable.
monica I mean, was it Gina?
ross Which one is Gina?
rachel Dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.
monica No, no, no, that's Dina.
chandler You see you can't tell which one is which either, dwha!!
phoebe We didn't fool around with any of them. Dwha! Dwha!
chandler Veronica. Look, it's got to be Veronica, the girl in the red skirt. I definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.
monica That was me.
chandler Look, when I've been drinking, sometimes I tend to get overly friendly, and I'm sorry.
monica That's okay.
rachel That's all right.
ross That's okay.
joey Can I talk to you for a second?!
ross Hey, Joey.
rachel Hey.
joey Come on!!
chandler Why can't we talk in here? With, with, witnesses.
joey I just got off the phone with my sister.
ross Ah, which, which one?
joey Mary-Angela.
ross Mary-Angela.
joey Yeah.
monica Y'know which one was she again?
joey Why don't you ask Chandler, 'cause he's the one that fooled around with her. She told me you said you could really fall for her. Now is that true? Or are you just gettin' over Janice by groping my sister.
chandler It's gotta be the first one.
joey Really? That's great! You and my sister, sittin' in a tree.
chandler Yep, I'm in a tree.
rachel Did he call? Did Mark call?
monica No honey, I'm sorry, but the weekend's not over yet.
rachel Oh. Oh my God, is that Phoebe?
monica I guess they're back from their date.
rachel Music. Very nice.
monica Oh my God!
rachel So, how are you?
monica I am good. I finished my book.
rachel Oh yeah, what's it about?
monica I don't remember. Do you wanna take a walk?
rachel Yeah, I do.
ross Dear Mary-Angela. Hi. How's it going. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. What the hell's a matter with you? How do you think Joey's going to react when he finds out that you blew off his sister with a letter?
chandler Well, that's the part where you tell him that I moved to France. When actually I'll be in Cuba.
ross All right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay in person. At least you know her name. You just go to the house and you ask for Mary-Angela, okay, when which ever one she is comes to the door, you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
chandler What if Mary-Angela comes to the door and I ask for Mary-Angela?
ross Where in Cuba?
chandler Joey, what-wh-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-wh-wha-what are you doing here?
joey Waiting for my Grandma to finish my laundry. What about you?
chandler I'm here to see Mary-Angela.
joey You are so the man! Now look, listen, listen, you got to be cool, 'cause my Grandma doesn't know about you two yet, and you do not want to tick her off. She was like the sixth person to spit on Mussolini's hanging body. Yeah.
chandler Where's Mary-Angela?
joey She's right in there.
joeys_sisters Hey, Chandler!
rachel I can't believe Mark didn't call. It's Sunday night, and he didn't call.
ross Bummer.
rachel Yeah, right. Look at you, you're practically giddy.
ross No, I'm genuinely sorry the Mark thing didn't work out. Look, Rach, I want only good things for you.
monica Wait a minute, why don't you just call Mark. I mean, who says you have to sit here and wait for him, you've got to make stuff happen.
ross But, you, you don't want to seem too pushy.
monica Honey, it's not pushy, he gave her his home number.
ross What, he gave you his home number? As in like, to, to his home?
rachel Yeah, and you don't mind if I call, because you only want good things for me.
ross That's right good things, that-that is what I said.
rachel Hello, Mark? Hi, it's Rachel Green. Oh no, don't you apologize. Yeah, I'll hold. He left my number at work, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.
ross That is so made up!
rachel Yeah, oh my God, tomorrow! That, no, it's perfect. Oh God, thank you soo much. Great! Bye! I got the interview!
monica Yay!
ross There you go.
rachel He even offered to meet me for lunch tomorrow to prep me for it.
monica Oh, that is amazing!
ross Yeah well, if I know Mark, and I think I do, I'd expect nothing less.
rachel I got to figure out what I'm going to wear.
ross High collar and baggy pants say I'm a pro.
rachel Yeah! Right! Okay, I'll see you guys later. Woo hoo!
ross You go get 'em. What did I do to you? Did I hurt you in some way?
monica What?
ross 'Why don't you call him?!' Well, thank you very much! Y'know now he is going to prep her, y'know prep her, as in what you do when you surgically remove the boyfriend!
monica Are you crazy?!
ross Am I! Am I! Am I out of my mind! Am I losing my senses!! This dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.
monica What?! Ross y'know this isn't even about you! I mean this is about Rachel and something wonderful happening for her. I mean you know even if you're right, what if he wants to sleep with her, does it mean he gets too?
ross No.
monica I mean don't you trust her?
ross Well, yeah!
monica Then get over yourself! Grow up!
ross You grow up.
chandler This teramisu is, is excellent. Did you make it Mary-Angela?
joeys_grandmother No! I did!
chandler Well, it's, it's yummy. So Mary-Angela do you like it?
joeys_grandmother Of course! It's her favorite.
chandler So um, Mary-Angela, what's your second favorite?
joeys_grandmother More of Grandma's teramisu.
chandler Would you just please....give me the receipt 'cause this is great. It's top notch.
joeys_grandmother That dies with me.
chandler So will I.
joeys_sister Excuse yourself, and go to the bathroom.
chandler Oh no-no-no I was just squinting. That doesn't mean anything.
joeys_sister Just do it.
chandler Will you excuse me I have to um.....
chandler Hey!
joeys_sister Finally, I thought we'd never be alone. Can I just tell you something, I have not stopped thinking about you since the party.
chandler Look, I may have jumped the gun here. Um, I just got out of a relationship and I'm not really in a, in a commitment kind of place.
joeys_sister So! Me neither! God, Mary-Angela was right you do have the softest lips.
chandler Ahhhh, you're not Mary-Angela.
joeys_sister No, I'm Mary-Theresa.
chandler This is so bad. If-if you're not Mary-Angela, then-then who is?
maryangela I am!
chandler Oh, this is soo bad.
maryangela Joey!!!
chandler No Joey! No Joey! Don't Joey! Joey!
joey What's goin' on?
chandler You're it! Now run and hide!
marytheresa It's no big deal. Chandler was just kissin' me because he thought I was Mary-Angela.
joey What?! How could you do that, how could you think she was Mary-Angela?
chandler I wasn't sure which one Mary-Angela was. Look, I'm sorry okay, I was really drunk, and you all look really similar.
joeys_sister I say, punch him Joey.
all Yeah! Punch him!!
chandler Y'know what, we should all calm down because your brother's not going to punch me. Are ya?
joey Well, that is usually what I would do. But I just never thought you'd be on the receiving end of it. How could you do this?!
chandler Joey if you wanna punch me, go ahead, I deserve it. But I just want you to know that I would never soberly hurt you or your family, you're my best friend. I would never do anything like this ever again.
cookie So what. I say, punch him.
all Yeah! Punch him! Punch him!
joey No! No! No! No, I'm not going to punch Chandler.
cookie I'll do it.
joey No you won't. Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry. But, you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela.
chandler Okay, absolutely!
joey All right.
chandler You've got it.
joey Cookie, now you can punch him!
chandler What?!
rachel Hey!
ross Hi!
rachel What are you doing here?
ross Ah y'know, this building is on my paper route so I...
rachel Oh.
ross Hi.
rachel Hi.
ross How'd did it go?
rachel Oh well, the woman I interviewed with was pretty tough, but y'know thank God Mark coached me, because once I started talking about the fall line, she got all happy and wouldn't shut up.
ross I'm so proud of you.
rachel Me too!
ross Listen, I'm ah, I'm sorry I've been so crazy and jealous and, it's just that I like you a lot, so...
rachel I know.
ross Yeah.
rachel Yeah.
mark Rachel?
rachel Yeah. Hi Mark!
mark Hi. I just talked to Joanna, and she loves you. You got it, you got the job.
rachel Oh, I did!
mark Yes.
rachel Oh my God!!
ross Congratu!! -lations-lations.
monica So ah, Phoebe, how was your date?
phoebe Oh well y'know.
monica Yeah, I do know.
phoebe Ick, you were eavesdropping.
rachel Eavesdropping. Pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.
phoebe Oh, I'm sorry. But I really like this guy. And I think he really happens to like me.
ross Maybe he's just jumping on a pogo-stick and really likes it?
ross Maybe the pogo-stick likes it too?
joey All right, that's it! He cannot do this to Phoebe. This guy is going to get the butt kicking of a lifetime! But, is he a big guy?
ross Ah, we'll all go. Come on.
phoebe Thanks you guys! Thank you.
chandler Don't worry.
phoebe God, I hope they kick his ass!
rachel Honey, I'm sorry.
monica Y'know if it's any consolation, he really did sound like he was having more fun with you.
guy May I help you?
