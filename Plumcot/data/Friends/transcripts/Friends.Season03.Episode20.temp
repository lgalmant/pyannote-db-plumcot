chandler Wait a minute, wait. You're telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn't want you back?!
joey Yeah! Oh my God! Is this what it's like to be you?
monica Wow, you're really crazy about her, huh?
joey Oh, you have no idea. And-and when we're on stage I get to-to kiss her and-and touch her, but then she goes home with the director, and it's like somebody's ripping out my heart!
phoebe Oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this!
ross Hey!
all Hey!
ross Monica, uh Dad called this morning and ah, Aunt Silvia passed away.
monica Yes!! Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah!
ross We were all pretty shaken up about it.
phoebe Wait, am I missing something though? 'Cause I thought death was something that's supposed to be sad, in a way.
ross Well ah, Aunt Silvia was, well not a nice person.
monica Oh, she was a cruel, cranky, old bitch! And I'm sorry she died. Did Dad say I get the dollhouse?
ross You get the dollhouse.
monica I get the dollhouse!
phoebe Wow, a house for dolls, that is so cool! When I was kid, I had a barrel.
joey Uh, Pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?
phoebe No, just a barrel.
monica Y'know what, you can play with my dollhouse.
phoebe Really?! Really?!
monica Any time you want. Y'know, when I was younger, all I wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse, but no!! It was to be looked at, but never played with.
chandler My Grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.
rachel Hey, Sophie!
sophie Hey, Rach!
chandler Hey.
sophie Hey.
rachel Thanks for lunch, Chandler. Y'know, you didn't have to walk me all the way back up here.
chandler Oh, that's-that's okay, no problem.
rachel Honey um, honey, you do realise that we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office?
chandler Yes, I realise that.
rachel Summer catalogue!
chandler That's the stuff!
joanna Rachel, I need the Versachi invoice. Hello! You don't work for me.
rachel Joanna, this is my friend Chandler Bing Joanna.
joanna Bing! That's a great name.
chandler Thanks, it's ah, Gaelic, for 'Thy turkey's done.' So ah, I'm gonna go, nice, nice meeting you.
joanna Me too.
rachel Bye, Chandler.
joanna So ah, what's wrong with him?
rachel Oh, nothing, he's just goofy like that, I actually, hardly notice it anymore.
joanna Oh no, no-no-no, is he ah, married, or involved with anyone?
rachel No!! No! He's not married, or involved, with anyone!
joanna Oh, Rachel, actually, y'know what, forget it.
rachel Well, I'll ask him for you, if you want me too?
joanna Would you? Or, is it just to sad and desperate, and y'know something that Sophie would do?
sophie Uh, uh, uh, I am here.
joanna I know that.
monica Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!
phoebe Hey!
chandler Hello.
phoebe Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
monica I know!!!
phoebe So, I'm here, ready to play.
monica Okay.
phoebe I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha.
monica What's this?
phoebe That's a dog, every house should have a dog.
monica Not one that can pee on the roof.
phoebe Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.
chandler And is this in case the house sneezes?
phoebe No, no, that's the ghost for the attic.
monica I don't want a ghost.
phoebe Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground.
ross Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen.
phoebe Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government.
rachel Hey!
all Hello.
rachel I need to talk to you!
ross Sure, what's up?
rachel Oh, sorry. I meant Chandler.
ross I-I know. Well if something comes up...
chandler Oh, I'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.
rachel Okay, my boss, Joanna, when you left, she started asking questions about you...
chandler Oh-ho, liked what she saw, huh? Dug my action, did she? Checkin' out the Chan-Chan man!
rachel That was surreal. Okay, what do think? Are you interested at all?
chandler Yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. I'll do it.
rachel Oh thank you, Chandler, this is so great, she's gonna love me.
phoebe Okay, dinosaur attack!! Quick, everybody into the house!! Ahh-ahh! Roof! Rrroof-roof-roof!
monica Okay, Phoebe, y'know what? That-that's it, that's it, all right? No dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay? They're not the right size, they're not Victorian, and they just don't go.
phoebe Okay, fine. Come dinosaur, we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.
ross Uh, Pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject. I just have to say dinosaurs, they-they don't go, rrroof!
phoebe The little ones do.
joey Hey, Kate!
kate Morning.
joey Listen, I ah, went to that restaurant that you were talking about last week...
the_director Hey, lovely! Come, talk to me a minute!
joey And I ate the food, I had the fish, it was good, yeah. It was good, yeah...
woman Hi, oh, I'm Lauren, Kate's understudy.
joey Oh, hey! Joey Tribbiani.
lauren I know! I-I'm a big fan of yours.
joey What?!
lauren I used to umm, schedule my classes so I could watch Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives.
joey Get out of here, really?!
lauren Absolutely!
joey Yeah?
lauren Oh but then, they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.
joey They gave me the shaft all right.
lauren Oh, you're so funny. Listen, umm, what are you doing after rehearsals? Do you want to get a drink, or something?
joey Well Ahh, yeah! Yeah, sure, a drink sounds great.
lauren Cool! I-I'll see you then.
joey All right.
the_director All right, it's time to act, my talking props.
phoebe Hey!
all Hey!
phoebe Look everybody, look at my new dollhouse!!
rachel Wow!!
phoebe Look, look!
ross Hey, what's this?!
phoebe Oh, okay, it's the slide instead of stairs. Watch this.
monica It's very interesting, Phoebe.
rachel What's this?
phoebe The Licorice Room, you can eat all the furniture. And, when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.
ross This is the coolest house ever!!
phoebe Hey, does anybody want to join me in the aroma room?
rachel All right!
ross I would!
monica Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!
ross_and_rachel Uh-huh.
phoebe Watch, watch.
ross_and_rachel Ooohhhh!!
phoebe And, and!
ross_and_rachel Ahhhh!!
chandler Hey, my Father's house does that!
rachel O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything.
chandler Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening.
rachel Hmm.
chandler Of course, I didn't get to enjoy any of that, because Joanna's such a big, dull dud!
joanna Chandler is fantastic!!
rachel What?!
joanna Oh God, we just clicked! Y'know how people just click? Like he came by to pick me up, and I opened the door, and it was just like, click! Did he tell you?
rachel Oh, I....
joanna Oh, and he's got such a good heart! Doesn't he have a good heart?
rachel Oh, I know...
joanna Oh, I know and he's soo sweet! Listen, he said he was going to call, so put him straight through.
sophie Isn't this great?!
joanna Don't spoil it.
joey Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
the_director Hello. Oh! It's you. Just ah, just one-one sec. I am going to take this call. When I continue, I hope that there will appear on stage this magical thing that in the theatre we call, committing to the moment!
joey That guy's like a cartoon. What do you see in him anyway?
kate He happens to be brilliant. Which is more than I can say for that sweater you're dating.
joey Hey, I'm not interested in her sweater! It's what's underneath her sweater that counts. And besides, since ah, since when do you care who I'm going out with?
kate I don't care. Why, do you want me to care?
joey Do you want me to want you to care?
kate Do you?
joey What?
the_director Okay, I'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.
joey Come on baby, don't go. Please? What do you say?
kate I've got no reason to stay.
the_director Stop!! Stop it! You must stop! You are bad actors! This is a terrible play! I'll see you in the morning.
kate I can't believe we go on in, in a week.
joey Hey, it's gonna be all right.
lauren Hey! So since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?
joey What?
lauren You know! At the place I told you about last night?
joey Oh, yeah, with the mug painting. Yeah. I was so listening to that. But ah, y'know what, I think I kinda need to work on my stuff tonight.
lauren Oh, okay.
joey Okay.
lauren I'll see you tomorrow.
joey Okay.
lauren G'night.
joey Ah, are you okay?
kate Yeah, I guess. Look, what are we gonna do about this scene, huh?
joey I don't know.
kate Well umm, maybe if it had more heat.
joey How do you mean?
kate Well, Adrian's looking for a reason to stay, right? Victor can't just kiss her, he's gotta, gotta really give her a reason, y'know?
joey Maybe he could slip her the tongue.
kate Or maybe, maybe he could grab her, and, and, and, and lift her up.
joey Yeah, yeah, and then Adrian, she maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.
kate And then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest, and, and his stomach!
joey And then, then he could use his teeth, his teeth to undo her dress, and, and, and bite her!
kate And then right, right when the scene ends, he could take her with this raw, animal....
joey Something like that?
kate Yeah, that's pretty much what I had in mind.
joey Yeah.
joey Hey.
ross Hi.
joey Hey.
ross Hi.
joey Hey.
ross It's a little early to be drinkin'.
joey No-no, things ah, finally happened with Kate.
ross Ohhhhh!
monica You're kidding?! That's great!
joey Oh, it was so amazing. After the love making...
monica Oh my.
joey Yep. I just, I just watched her sleep for like hours, just breathing in and breathing out. And then I knew she was dreaming 'cause, 'cause her eyes keep going like this.
chandler I'm telling ya, Joanna's got it all wrong. Okay? All I said was, 'This was fun. Let's do it again sometime. I'll give you a call.'
rachel Ohh, gee. I wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?
chandler That's what you say at the end of a date.
rachel You can't just say, 'Nice to meet you, good night?'
chandler To her face? Look it's the end of the date, I'm standing there, I know all she's waiting for is for me to say 'I'll call her' and it's just y'know, comes out. I can't help it, it's a compulsion.
monica Come on Rach, when a guy says he's going to call, it doesn't mean he's going to call. Hasn't it ever happened to you?
rachel Well, they always called.
monica Hmm, bite me.
joanna Did he call?
rachel No. Sorry.
joanna Why?! Why?! He said he'd call. Why hasn't he called?
sophie Maybe he's intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.
joanna Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn't he called, Rachel? Why?
rachel Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.
joanna Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?
rachel Well...
joanna The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, did you?
rachel No. I...
joanna Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.
rachel Call her! Call her now!
chandler Multiple, so many paper cuts.
rachel Why hasn't he called Rachel? Why? Why? I don't understand. Why? He said he'll call. Why? Why? Chandler I'm telling you she has flipped out, she's gone crazy!
chandler Oh, well give me the phone then.
rachel Come on, this isn't funny. She thinks it's my fault that you haven't called her. You have to call her!
chandler Look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say, 'In case you didn't notice, I don't like you!'
rachel Well then you're going to have to take her out again.
chandler Nooo!! She's really dull! And she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye!
rachel I don't care! I don't care! You are going to have to take her out again and end it, and end it in way that she knows it's actually ended. And, I don't care how hard it is for you, do not tell her that you will call her again!
chandler All right! Fine! But it's just a lunch date, no more than an hour! And from now on I get my own dates, I don't want you setting me up with anybody ever again!
rachel That's fine!
chandler That's just a lot of big talk, y'know.
rachel I know.
ross Mon?
monica I'm in the shower!
ross Oh, fire! There, there's a fire! Fire!!
joey Hey.
kate Hi.
joey So I ah, talked to Lauren, kinda told her how things were with us. Did you ah, did you talk to Marshall?
kate About what?
joey Y'know, about what happened with us.
kate Nooo. And there's really no reason he should find out, so ah let's not make a big deal about it, okay?
joey What are you talking about? It was a big deal. I mean, come on you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you. I-I was there, you're not that good an actress.
kate Look umm, I, I was, I was just caught up in the moment. That's all it was. Joey, I'm-I'm sorry you feel bad, but haven't you ever sleep with a women where it meant more to her than it did to you?
joey Nooo.
lauren Hi, Kate!
kate Hi, Lauren.
joey Hi, Lauren.
lauren Hi, pig!
ross Sorry I ah, I scared you in there.
monica Oh, that's okay. By the way, I was just checking the shower massager.
ross Yeah.
phoebe Hey!
monica I tried to reach you at work. There's....been a fire.
phoebe What?! Oh my... Oh my God!! What happened?!
ross Well, we believe it originated here. In the Aroma Room.
phoebe All right. Did everyone get out okay?
monica Well, the giraffe's okay. And so is the pirate.
phoebe Ohh. What is this?
ross No Phoebe, don't look! You don't want to see what's under there!!
phoebe Ohh, the-the Foster puppets!
chandler It's not a big deal. It's, just it's right here, and it's all the time.
joanna Well, thanks again for lunch.
chandler Yes, this, this was pleasant.
joanna It was, wasn't it?
chandler The food there was, was great.
joanna Wasn't it?
chandler So take care.
joanna You too.
chandler Well, this was great. I'll give you a call. We should do it again sometime.
joanna Great! I'm looking forward to it. Rachel, any messages?
rachel Sophie's desk.
rachel Chandler!! Are you gonna call her!
chandler Noo!
rachel Chandler!!
chandler Look, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm weak, and pathetic, and sorry.
rachel Okay, you are going to tell her and you're going to tell her now.
chandler Ahhhh-I'm not going to call you.
joanna What?
chandler I'm sorry. I'm-I'm-I'm sorry that I said I was going to when I'm not. Look, this has nothing to do with you, y'know? And this isn't Rachel's fault. It's me. I have serious, serious problems when it comes to women. I have issues with commitment, intimacy, mascara goop. And I'm really sorry, it's just that this is not, this isn't going to work out.
joanna Well, this isn't how I was hoping how this would end, but I guess I have to appreciate your honesty.
chandler Yeah, o-okay.
joanna So...
chandler Well this is great! I'll give you a call! We should do it again sometime!
joey Well, so anyway Beth, what I'm saying is I should've considered your feelings before I went home with you that night. I've ah, I've recently learned what's it like to be on your side of it, and I'm sorry. So, do you think you can forgive me? Great. Thanks. Okay, bye. Hello, Jennifer? Oh hi, Mrs. Loreo, is Jennifer there? Oh, she's not home huh? Well ah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.
