rachel_green Yeah. Don't do this to yourself.
phoebe_buffay She's made it pretty clear, it is not going to happen.
joey_tribbiani Well all right then, I guess I shouldn't get to excited about the fact that I just kissed her!
monica_geller You serious?!
chandler_bing That's great!
monica_geller Really?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah well, we'll see.
dr_ross_geller You kissed her.
joey_tribbiani Oh we kissed it up real nice.
chandler_bing So you kissed her, so what happened after that?
joey_tribbiani I came over here to tell you guys.
chandler_bing So she's just waiting over there for ya?
janine_lecroix I gotta go.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
janine_lecroix I'm gonna be really late for dance class!
joey_tribbiani Okay.
janine_lecroix Okay, now I'm really late.
joey_tribbiani Okay, I'm all right, okay, but hey, could you just leave your lips?
janine_lecroix Bye.
monica_geller Bye.
joey_tribbiani Have you kissed her yet? It's awesome! I could do it forever! Y'know what? She-she kisses better than my mom cooks!
monica_geller I am so glad you said cooks.
rachel_green I know.
chandler_bing Oh hey Rachel, sweetheart? You have got to tell the post office that you have moved. Okay? We are still getting all your bills and stuff.
rachel_green Oh-oh, Pottery Barn! You can throw the rest away.
chandler_bing I'm not your garbage man. I'm your mailman.
rachel_green Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered.
monica_geller You got it from Pottery Barn?!
rachel_green Yeah! It's an apothecary table. Does anyone even know what an apothecary is?
chandler_bing A pharmacist.
monica_geller Rach, Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.
joey_tribbiani I hate Pottery Barn too. They kicked me out of there just because I sat on a bed!
chandler_bing You took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!
joey_tribbiani I was tired!
rachel_green Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!
monica_geller Yeah, she hates all mass produced stuff. She thinks her furniture should have a history, a story behind it.
rachel_green Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.
monica_geller It's gotta be one of a kind. Y'know like umm, y'know uh, what's that God awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?
joey_tribbiani Hey! I made that for her!
chandler_bing You made pottery?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! I made it of this fruit bowl I found in the garbage.
monica_geller I'm telling-If you put that in her apartment you'll never hear the end of it.
rachel_green Okay fine! I'll-I'll just tell her it's an antique apothecary table, she doesn't have to know where it came from. Oh! Look at this little drawers! Oh look-look it says that it holds 300 CDs.
chandler_bing Ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore
chandler_bing ...so then the farmer says, "That's not a cow and you're not milking it."
monica_geller I am so glad you guys got together, Chandler and I are always looking for a couple to go out with and now we have one!
chandler_bing Look at us, we're a couple of couples!
janine_lecroix I had so much fun tonight, and what a great restaurant.
monica_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani And Chandler I can't believe I let you pay for this one. Thanks man.
monica_geller So do you guys gonna come over tomorrow? I'll make that pasta thing I was telling you about.
janine_lecroix Oh that would be great!
joey_tribbiani Oh, but hey look, at least let us bring the wine.
monica_geller Joey, you don't have too!
joey_tribbiani Nope-op! I insist! You get the wine right?
chandler_bing Yeah all right. Okay, good night guys.
joey_tribbiani See ya tomorrow!
monica_geller Tomorrow!
janine_lecroix Can't wait!
janine_lecroix How are we gonna get out of that one?
joey_tribbiani What?
janine_lecroix I can't handle two nights in a row with them.
joey_tribbiani What-what's wrong with Monica and Chandler?
janine_lecroix I don't know, they're just a little blah!
joey_tribbiani Blah?!
janine_lecroix Well y'know, he's blah, she's just-she's very loud for such a small person.
joey_tribbiani Uh, they're like my best friends. Are you saying we can't hang out with them? 'Cause that would kinda be a problem.
janine_lecroix No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just y'know, not two nights in a row. Okay?
joey_tribbiani I guess.
janine_lecroix Thank you.
joey_tribbiani If you want, I'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, what a great table! Where-where did you get it?
rachel_green Guess!
phoebe_buffay Umm, a flea market?
rachel_green Ha! See, I knew, I knew you'd get it on the first guess. Isn't it cool! It's an apothecary table.
phoebe_buffay Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where they kept all the stuff to make their potions.
rachel_green Ohh, yes.
phoebe_buffay Y'know? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.
rachel_green Almost.
phoebe_buffay How much was it?
rachel_green It was only 500 bucks.
phoebe_buffay 500 bucks at a flea market?!
rachel_green Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, y'know like back then.
phoebe_buffay Oh no.
rachel_green Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was y'know, it was like a dollar.
phoebe_buffay A dollar?
rachel_green And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Well, what period is it from?
rachel_green Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?
phoebe_buffay Yes, yes I do. God, oh it's just perfect! Wow! I bet it has a great story behind it too. Did they tell you anything? Like y'know where it was from or
rachel_green Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains.
phoebe_buffay White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place.
rachel_green Hey! We're here!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Ohh! Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller You like it?
rachel_green Oh no!
dr_ross_geller It's my new apothecary table!
rachel_green Ross! Phoebe's gonna be here any second, she cannot see this!
dr_ross_geller Well why not?! She'll-she'll love it! It's the real thing! I got it at Pottery Barn.
rachel_green I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table she's gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.
dr_ross_geller Why did you do that?
rachel_green Because she hates Pottery Barn.
dr_ross_geller She hates Pottery Barn?!!
rachel_green I know! I know, she says it's all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. So come on, she's gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?
dr_ross_geller What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe-Ooh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets!
rachel_green Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!
dr_ross_geller Uh, yeah! I still can't believe she hates Pottery Barn!
rachel_green Ross, get over it! It's not like she hates you.
dr_ross_geller Yeah but Pottery Barn! Y'know what I think? It's just she-she's weird. Y'know it's because she's a twin. Twins are weird.
rachel_green Ross, she's not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.
dr_ross_geller Huh. Y'know what's not one of a kind? A twin!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Ooh, Phoebe's here! Okay, let's turn out all the lights and we'll just watch the movie!
phoebe_buffay Okay. Hey-Ooh, cool sheets!
dr_ross_geller Oh, you like it? You wanna know where I got it?
phoebe_buffay Sure!
rachel_green He got it a flea market!
phoebe_buffay You bought your sheets at a flea market? Ross come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.
monica_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hi!
monica_geller The dinner will be ready in twenty minutes. This is so exciting.
chandler_bing And here is the bottle of wine for you to bring over tonight. You were also going to buy Monica flowers but you couldn't afford it, because you paid dinner last night.
joey_tribbiani Thanks. Thanks, but uh actually it's just gonna be me again tonight.
monica_geller What happened to Janine?
joey_tribbiani Oh, she's uh-uh really sick.
chandler_bing Oh that's too bad.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, she's been in there all day , uh high fever, a nose problem... Phlegm! Phlegm! Phlegm-phlegm-phlegm!
janine_lecroix Monica! Chandler! I'm really-really sorry about tonight. I don't know if Joey told you; I just couldn't get out of going to this play. I'm sorry. Have a great time.
joey_tribbiani 'Kay!
janine_lecroix Bye.
chandler_bing That's funny, I saw no phlegm.
joey_tribbiani No-no, she really is sick!
chandler_bing Then why-why is she going to a play?!
joey_tribbiani Uh, y'know, starve a fever, go to a play for a cold.
monica_geller Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!
joey_tribbiani Well uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. I'm so sorry.
chandler_bing Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!
joey_tribbiani Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.
monica_geller What?!! What?
chandler_bing So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!
monica_geller Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!
chandler_bing And I am not blah, I am a hoot!
joey_tribbiani I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, don't-don't be mad. I'm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Y'know? And it was our first date! Plus, she's really sick!
chandler_bing No, you sh-No you said you made that up!!
joey_tribbiani I know, but don't you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?
chandler_bing Eh, they're both good. I generally just go with, Monica's drunk again.
joey_tribbiani Come on you guys, come on please-please just give her another chance, huh? She'll come around I promise.
monica_geller Of course we will, come on we gotta make dinner.
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller I do not like that woman!
joey_tribbiani I can hear you!
monica_geller I am loud!
all@ Aww!
rachel_green That's funny.
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet?
phoebe_buffay Oh sure! Noo!
rachel_green Ohh!!
dr_ross_geller My apothecary table!!!
phoebe_buffay What?!
rachel_green Noooooo!!
phoebe_buffay Ross, where did you get this?!
dr_ross_geller I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!
rachel_green Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!
phoebe_buffay Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!
rachel_green Oh yes.
phoebe_buffay Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
dr_ross_geller Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way.
phoebe_buffay Oh Ross, calm down, I'll give you the 80 cents.
chandler_bing Okay, one more time.
monica_geller Chandler, would you like some more orange juice?
chandler_bing Perfect decibel.
monica_geller I know!!!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani So uh, what are you guys doing?
chandler_bing Oh nothing, we're just talking. Y'know, blah-blah-blah.
joey_tribbiani Look, come on you guys, you said you were gonna try! All right look, I came over here to invite you guys to a movie with me and Janine.
monica_geller Well, I'd like to but, I'm not sure we have time to go.
joey_tribbiani Ha-ha, very funny-Look! I don't know what to do! I really want you guys to get along. Just please come to the movie with us. I mean you owe me!
monica_geller We owe you?!
joey_tribbiani That's right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!
monica_geller We didn't give you any money!
joey_tribbiani You don't think I know that!
rachel_green ...see I can't decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.
dr_ross_geller Wow! I didn't know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.
rachel_green I know, I know. I went a little crazy.
dr_ross_geller A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.
dr_ross_geller Fascinating.
phoebe_buffay Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!
rachel_green Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.
phoebe_buffay Ah!
dr_ross_geller Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel?
rachel_green Well there's yore. And uh, y'know, yesteryear.
phoebe_buffay Yeah no, I'm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, y'know if you ever decide you need to redecorate-And I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.
rachel_green Oh honey he doesn't need my help.
phoebe_buffay Oh, come on! I think he's ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.
dr_ross_geller Really?! Hey, y'know what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, here's-here's 60 bucks, why don't you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.
rachel_green Y'know what? I don't, I don't think Phoebe really wants to come.
phoebe_buffay No! I do want to!
rachel_green Oh, she does want to.
dr_ross_geller She does want to.
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
rachel_green Pheebs, I don't know what to say. I guess the flea market was just better last time.
phoebe_buffay Well at least I got these sheets for Ross.
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!
rachel_green Yeah, y'know what? Don't look at it. Seriously, don't look at it.
phoebe_buffay No! Look-look! There's the coffee table they stole from us!
rachel_green Ugh, those bastards! Let's go.
phoebe_buffay That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and the...wait a sec! This is our exact living room!
rachel_green No! No! No! No it's not! No it's not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we don't have the... We don't have the...that lamp! And-and that screen is y'know, on the other side.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!
rachel_green Okay! Okay-okay look-no I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Just... Come on don't be mad.
phoebe_buffay No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And it's all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I don't have that lamp!
rachel_green Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.
phoebe_buffay I can't! I can't! Unless... Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didn't buy that lamp?
rachel_green What?! No! I'm not gonna move out!
phoebe_buffay But are you saying that you would move out if I didn't buy that lamp?
rachel_green Oh. Yes! I would so move out!
phoebe_buffay Okay then I don't have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!
rachel_green That's right!
phoebe_buffay But at least the apothecary table is real.
joey_tribbiani Well, this-this-this was great. Didn't everybody have a great time?
janine_lecroix Well I did. I really did. And you guys, I've got to say, I'm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.
chandler_bing That's totally understandable.
monica_geller Don't worry about it.
janine_lecroix So we can go out again?
chandler_bing Oh yeah!
monica_geller Absolutely!
janine_lecroix Oh good.
joey_tribbiani Oh well then, good night!
monica_geller Good night!
joey_tribbiani See? Eh, wasn't that fun?
janine_lecroix We have got to move!
monica_geller I knew it!! Y'know, you're not so quiet yourself, missy!
chandler_bing And I'm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."
janine_lecroix Y'know, I know you're talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."
monica_geller All right! You and me! Let's go! Right now!
joey_tribbiani All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine!
chandler_bing Y'know I think you can take her.
monica_geller You'd better hope I don't see you in the hallway!!
joey_tribbiani All right, uh, we've got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you can't treat them that way.
janine_lecroix They said stuff to me too, y'know!
joey_tribbiani I know! I know! And I'm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. They... They're like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-I... I don't think we can be together. It just, it just can't work. It can't. I'm very upset.
janine_lecroix Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah.
monica_geller What did I tell you about the hall?!
janine_lecroix I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! I'd really like it if we could be friends.
monica_geller Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.
janine_lecroix Great.
monica_geller Now come on. Well, I'm glad we worked things out.
janine_lecroix Me too.
monica_geller Okay.
janine_lecroix I'll see you.
monica_geller Bye.
janine_lecroix Or I'll hear you.
monica_geller That's it big girl! Come on!
janine_lecroix Wait!
monica_geller You'd better run!
chandler_bing Did you hear that?
joey_tribbiani Yeah uh, what am I gonna do?
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm sorry man. You wanna go watch?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani How ya doin'?
chandler_bing Hey so, did uh, did she move out?
joey_tribbiani Pretty much, yeah.
monica_geller I cannot believe you broke up with her just like that.
joey_tribbiani Well, when it's not right, you know it.
chandler_bing You okay?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah. I'll be all right.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what would cheer you up?
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller I'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night, I think you should come.
joey_tribbiani You're right! That did cheer me up!
