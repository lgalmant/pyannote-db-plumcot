rachel_green Okay. Hey. Umm. Does everybody hate these shoes?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, but don't worry. I don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress.
rachel_green Tell him.
dr_ross_geller It's her first day at this new job. Your not supposed to start with her!
chandler_bing All right, I suppose I can wait a day. Hey, what are you doing Friday?
dr_ross_geller Why?
chandler_bing I need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin Albert, y'know he's the botanist.
dr_ross_geller Oh God. Y'know, botanists are such geeks.
chandler_bing Yeah. Is that a dinosaur tie?
dr_ross_geller Hmm? Oh, yeah.
phoebe_buffay Morning. Rach, I'm here with the purses!
chandler_bing It must take you forever to find your keys.
rachel_green Thank you, thank you, thank you, Pheebs.
phoebe_buffay Your welcome, oh please not the one with the turtles.
rachel_green No, no, no, no turtles scare me. I don't need that today.
dr_ross_geller Honey, just relax, it's gonna be fine. Hey, umm,. why don't I come down there and I'll take you out to lunch?
rachel_green Oh honey, thank you, but Mark's taking me out.
dr_ross_geller Mark is that ah, the same Mark that helped you get the job?
rachel_green Yeah, it's kinda like a 'good luck on your first day' sort of thing. Is this actually a lunchbox?
phoebe_buffay Umm, no, it's a purse. And there's a thermos in it.
rachel_green Oh.
chandler_bing Hey, so can you make it on Friday?
dr_ross_geller What? Oh yeah, yeah I think so. Why am I invited to this again?
chandler_bing Well apparently Albert has no friends. He's very excited about the bachelor party though. I think actually the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.
phoebe_buffay A stripper at a bachelor party, that is so clich√°. Why don't you get a magician?!
chandler_bing Well, if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks, then all right.
dr_ross_geller She's having lunch with him. She's having lunch with him. And you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job. And, and, and, he's really good looking. What am I gonna do?
chandler_bing Don't do anything. Keep it inside. Learn how to hide your feelings! Don't cry outloud.
joey_tribbiani Yes! Guess who's in an audition for a Broadway musical?
chandler_bing I want to say you but, that seems like such an easy answer.
joey_tribbiani It is me! It's a musical version of Tale of Two Cities. So I think I'm gonna sing New York, New York, and ah, oh I left My Heart in San Francisco.
dr_ross_geller Ah Joey, I don't think you get to pick the cities.
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller Mr. Dickens gets to pick 'em.
joey_tribbiani Who?
chandler_bing I'll get you the Cliff Notes.
joey_tribbiani The what?
chandler_bing The abridgment.

dr_ross_geller Ohhhhh yeah, that's, that's funny. Why ah, why isn't he goofing around in his own office?
rachel_green Oh honey, this is his office too. I told you we're Joanna's two assistants.
dr_ross_geller Why does Joanna need two assistants, how, how lazy is she?
rachel_green Oh! Oh my God! What did I just do?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I think I just shipped 3,000 bras to personnel. Oh honey, I gotta go. Mark, I need you!

monica_geller Your a poet and don't know it.
julio Actually I ah, I am a poet.
monica_geller Oh, then you do know it. So um what kind of things do you write about?
julio Things that move me. The, the shadow of a tree, a child laughing, or this lip.
monica_geller Mine? Right here?
julio I can write an epic poem about this lip.
monica_geller How would that go? Well, it didn't rhyme, but I liked it.
joey_tribbiani You've got to pick a pocket or two. Boyyyyssss, you've got to pick a pocket or two..........
the_director Lovely, just lovely.
joey_tribbiani Really? Thanks.
the_director Listen Joey, we definitely want to see you for the callback on Saturday.
joey_tribbiani Excellent, I'll be there.
the_director Okay, and listen don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.
joey_tribbiani Ahhh! My ah, my agent said it wasn't a dancing part.
the_director Joey, all the roles got to dance a little. But believe me with your dance background it'll be a piece of cake.
chandler_bing ...three years of modern dance with Twila Tharp! Five years with the American Ballet Theater?!
joey_tribbiani Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay. I wasn't one of the Zoom Kids either.
phoebe_buffay Well, can you dance at all?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I can dance, y'know.
chandler_bing Oh no, no, no, no.
phoebe_buffay What, what is that?
joey_tribbiani Sure, it looks stupid now, there's no music playing.
chandler_bing All right, I have to get that, but no-no. Hello? Hi! Yeah listen, I'm, I'm in need of a stripper and I was told that you do that. Let me ask you this, what, what do you do for the extra hundred? So would I, would I have to provide the grapes?
monica_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay Oh, how was last night with Julio, senorita?
monica_geller It was soo amazing, he is so sexy, and smart, which makes him even sexier. Oh gosh, I gotta so you this. Last night, we were fooling around and he stops to write a poem.
joey_tribbiani Get out! I couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.
chandler_bing Okay, we have our stripper. A miss Crystal Chandelier.
joey_tribbiani Well sure, you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?
monica_geller Anyway um, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him. Now, I am like totally dense about poetry, but I think it's pretty good all right. Check it out.
joey_tribbiani The Empty Vase. Translucent beauty...
chandler_bing To yourself. Hey-hey-hey, y'know what that's pretty good.
monica_geller Oh good, I think so too. Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah.
monica_geller Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Yay! All right I gotta go to work.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, I'm not done.
monica_geller All right, just give it back to me when your done. See you guys.
chandler_bing Bye-bye.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, oh my God! Poor Monica!
chandler_bing What, what, what?!
phoebe_buffay What?! He was with her when he wrote this poem. Look, 'My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.' He thinks Monica is empty, she is the empty vase!
chandler_bing You really think that is what he meant?
phoebe_buffay Oh, totally. Oh, God, oh, she seemed so happy too.
joey_tribbiani Done.
mark_robinson Do you have the, the Ralph Lauren file?
rachel_green Oh, yeah, sure, it's umm...

dr_ross_geller It's from Ross, it's a love bug.
mark_robinson Wow! Somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.
rachel_green Oh no, no-no-no, that's not, not, not, what he is doing. He's just, he's just really romantic.
man#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Ah, excuse me, are you Rachel Green?
rachel_green Yes.
man#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 One, two, three...

quartet#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Your loyal loving boyfriend Ross..... Ross!
dr_ross_geller I'm hurt! I'm actually hurt, that you would think that I would send you any of those things out of any thing other than love. Hurt! Hurt!

rachel_green You're hurt!
dr_ross_geller ..can't, can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymorrrrre!!
rachel_green Oh, please, Ross it was so obvious! It was like you were marking your territory. I mean you might have well have just come in and peed all around my desk!
dr_ross_geller I would never do that!
rachel_green Look, I know what's going on here, okay, Mark explained it all to me. He said this is what you guys do.
dr_ross_geller Yeah well if, if, if Mark said that, than Mark's an idiot.
joey_tribbiani Mark's a genius!
dr_ross_geller Why?! How?! How is he a genius?
chandler_bing Look, don't you see what's happening here. Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant. Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.
dr_ross_geller What am I going to do?
chandler_bing Well, why don't you send her a musical bug, op, no you already did that. All right look, you're going to have to go there yourself now, okay, make a few surprise visits.
dr_ross_geller I don't know you guys.
chandler_bing All right fine, don't do anything, just sit here and talk to us, meanwhile she is talking to him about you. And he's being Mr. Joe Sensitive, and she starts thinking 'Maybe this is the guy for me, because he understands me.'
joey_tribbiani And before you know it, she's with him. And you'll be all, 'Ohh, man!' And he'll be all, 'Yes!' And us, we'll be like, 'Wh-whoa, dude.' And pretty soon you'll be like, 'Hhiii,' and, and, and, 'I can't go, Rachel and Mark might be there.' And we'll be like, 'Man get over it, it's been four years!!'
chandler_bing He paints quite a picture doesn't he?
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Here's the Shelly Siegal stuff from December.
mark_robinson And wait, I've got something for you.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Mark!!
mark_robinson It's okay, Rachel knows.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Yeah, but even soo.
mark_robinson I can't help it, I'm just, I'm just crazy about you.
rachel_green Ohhh! That is soo sweet!
mark_robinson Okay, okay look, I know I'm being Mr. Inappropriate today, but it's just so tough, I mean see you walking around and I just wanna touch you and hold you, come on no one's around, just, just kiss me.
dr_ross_geller All right that's, that's it!! Get off her!
mark_robinson What is going on?

rachel_green Ross!
dr_ross_geller I have been down in your store for twenty minutes trying to get a tie! What do I have to do to get some service?! Hi Rach.
the_director Ah Joey. Joey Tribbiani. Listen Joey, I got a problem, I just got a call from my dance captain, he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.
joey_tribbiani So, does that mean the audition is off?
the_director Listen Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience, I want you to take these dancers and show them the combination.
joey_tribbiani What?!
the_director Aw come on Joey, it's easy. Y'know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, pas de bouree, pas de bouree, big turn here, grand sissone, sissone, sissone, slide back, step, step, step, and jazz hands!
joey_tribbiani It's ah, step-ity, step and jazz hands.
the_director Have fun.
joey_tribbiani Bye.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey.
phoebe_buffay What are you wrapping?
monica_geller Oh-ho, look what I got Julio.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's a vase.
monica_geller Yeah, just like the one in the poem.
phoebe_buffay Well not exactly like the one in the poem.
monica_geller What do you mean?
phoebe_buffay Remember how you said you were really dense about poetry? Oh.
monica_geller So! I'm just an empty vase, huh?
julio What?
monica_geller Y'know, so I don't read as many important books as you do, and I don't write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else. And y'know what, I get excited about stupid stuff, like when I my People magazine comes on Saturday, and the new Hold Everything catalog. Y'know but that does not mean that I'm empty, I care about things. I care about my friends and family. You have no right to make that kind of judgment about me.
julio Whoa, whoa, whoa.
monica_geller You don't even know me...
julio Whoa, whoa, whoa, the poem is not about you.
monica_geller What?
julio The Empty Vase is not about you. My baby, you make me so sad that you would think this.
monica_geller I'm sorry, my friend Phoebe...
julio No, it's about all women. Well, all American women. You feel better now?
monica_geller Oh yeah.
the_director All right, let's do it!
the_director No, no, no. What was that?
joey_tribbiani I know, it was the best I could get out of them.
the_director Well, people!
joey_tribbiani People, people, people.
the_director Let's try it again, and this time let's watch everybody watch Joey. Show 'em how it's done. Count it off.
rachel_green So ah, did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, yeah! Look what I got, look what I got. See, she's fully dressed, right?
rachel_green Right.
chandler_bing And then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked. And then, and then you click it again and she's dressed. She's a business woman, she's walking down the street, she's window shopping, and whoa-whoa-whoa, sh-she's naked!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
rachel_green Hello.
chandler_bing Y'know what, I'm, I'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, I was an idiot.
rachel_green A big idiot.
dr_ross_geller A big idiot. Just you have to realize is, this whole Mark thing is kinda hard for me.
rachel_green Honey, why is it hard, I mean we've been together for almost a year now?
dr_ross_geller Well, I was with Carol for like eight years and I lost her. And now if it's possible I think I love you even more. So, it's hard for me to believe that I'm not gonna, well that someone else is not going to take you away.
gunther Let it be me! Let it be me!
rachel_green Honey, that's very sweet, it just seems to me though, that if two people love each other and trust each other, like we do, there's no reason to be jealous.
dr_ross_geller I gotta get going. Bye Chandler.
chandler_bing Oh, okay Ross. Listen, this pen is kinda getting boring, so can you pick me up some porn?
rachel_green Where ya going?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I've got to go pick up Ben, we've got a play date this afternoon.
rachel_green Ohh, with who?
dr_ross_geller Oh, just this woman that I met last night at the party.
rachel_green There was a woman at the... The stripper?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green You have a play date with a stripper?!
chandler_bing Man, I gotta get a kid.
dr_ross_geller Ah, yeah, yeah. Umm, we started talking after she y'know, did her thing. And it turns out she's got a boy about Ben's age, so we're taking them to a gym-boree class. Why, is that okay?
rachel_green Sure, is she married?
dr_ross_geller Ahh, no.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Are you jealous?
rachel_green Noo, I y'know I don't see why she has to play with you, that's all. I mean doesn't she have any y'know other stripper moms friends of her own?
dr_ross_geller You are totally jealous.
rachel_green I'm not jealous. All right this is about, umm, people feeling certain things y'know about strippers. And y'know, and um, I...
dr_ross_geller Honey, I love you too.
rachel_green Ugh. Wait, wait, wait.
dr_ross_geller What?
dr_ross_geller Huh.
rachel_green Well, there's a kiss that he won't forget for a couple of hours, y'know.
chandler_bing Yeah. Either that, or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.
man#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Is there a Julio here?
julio I am Julio.
man#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode12 Mister Pretensous, you think there's no one finer, well but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner.
