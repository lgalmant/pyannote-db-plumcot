cheryl So, thank you for the delicious dinner.
ross You're welcome for a delicious dinner.
phoebe Hey what are you guys looking at?
chandler Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.
phoebe Yeah, come to papa.
ross I know!
monica Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?
chandler Where did you, when did you, how did you... How did you get a girl like that?
rachel Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?
ross Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.
chandler Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.
ross I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.
rachel Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.
ross Fine by me; hope she wins.
chandler Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?
phoebe Oo! Is it for my birthday present?
chandler Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.
phoebe Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?
chandler Well, I have a call in about that.
phoebe 'Kay.
chandler Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.
rachel Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!
chandler Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.
rachel Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?
chandler Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.
rachel Oh, honey, that's so sweet.
phoebe Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"
chandler It doesn't say that. Does it?
ross How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?
chandler Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.
phoebe It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!
monica Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.
rachel Oh my God! What happened?
monica Sixty guests.
ross So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?
monica Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.
phoebe Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican....Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?
monica I don't know.
phoebe There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!
monica Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.
phoebe Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.
monica Well, you're not working either.
phoebe Yes, but I'm doing this.
monica Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!
joey Hey!
everyone Hey.
kathy Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?
joey Why?
joey You can pee here!
kathy Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.
chandler It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?
joey We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?
everyone Yeah!
rachel Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.
joey Oh, I know...
rachel And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."
phoebe Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?
rachel No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.
phoebe Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.
monica Hey!
rachel Hey, how'd it go?
monica Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrow-the dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!
phoebe Mon! I'm so happy for you!
monica Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!
phoebe I'll have one, please. Plus my money.
monica Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But look-I've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.
phoebe Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.
monica Okay.
ross Huh...
cheryl Um, would you like to come in?
ross Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?
cheryl According to recent findings!
cheryl Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!
ross Mitzi is.....
cheryl My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.
ross Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh.do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?
cheryl What?
ross Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...
cheryl I'd rather not.
ross Oh, yeah, why not?
cheryl Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.
monica Oh, is everything in the car?
phoebe Yes. Did you settle the bill?
monica No. I hate this part.
phoebe Oh, look what we almost left.
monica No, that's not mine.
phoebe Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!
monica Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.
mrs_burkart Oh, good. Thank you.
monica Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...
mrs_burkart Dear?
monica Just the matter of..payment?
mrs_burkart Jack used to handle the finances!
rachel You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.
chandler Sure...
rachel And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?
chandler I don't know... um, Grease?
rachel No....
chandler Rent?
rachel Yes! Rent!
chandler Okay, so when do you want to go?
rachel What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.
joey Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.
chandler Yes, it is, at Office Max.
rachel What did you get her?
chandler A pen.
joey It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?
chandler Huh-huh! You can't give her that.
joey Why not?
chandler Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!
rachel Okay, honey, what he means by that, is..while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?
joey Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"
chandler All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?
joey She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.
chandler For three years?
joey Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...
chandler All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?
joey Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?
chandler Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?
joey Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.
phoebe But Mon, you have to get our money!
monica Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.
phoebe I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?
monica What?
phoebe Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"
monica Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?
phoebe Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.
monica Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.
mrs_burkart You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....
phoebe She seems fine now.
mrs_burkart ..emblem of the land I love. The home of....
joey So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?
ross You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?
joey Yeah.
ross Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! Here.
joey Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?
ross What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.
joey All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.
ross No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.
joey What kind of smell?
ross I don't know. Soap?
joey All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?
ross Yeah.
joey You wanna see her again, right?
ross Yeah.
joey So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!
ross Yeah, okay you're right.
joey Yeah.
ross I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?
joey Yeah!
ross It's, uh... it's endearing, really.
joey All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! Oink!
chandler Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.
rachel Any luck?
chandler Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?
rachel All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.
chandler She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.
rachel Aw, honey, that's so sweet.
chandler Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?
rachel Oh! Pathetic!
joey Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!
chandler Where?
joey Our place, the hall! I...
chandler I got something for her. It's a book!
joey A book? Is it like a book that's also a safe?
chandler No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?
joey You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?
chandler No, it came out to an even twenty.
joey Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.
mrs_burkart Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?
phoebe You didn't get the money, did you?
monica Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!
phoebe No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! Hey, widow?
mrs_burkart Come on along and listen to...
phoebe Okay, Widow!
mrs_burkart ..the lullabye of...
phoebe Excuse me. Excuse me! Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.
mrs_burkart All right. I'll get my bag.
phoebe Good.
monica I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.
cheryl So you want to come inside?
ross Yes. Yes I do.
cheryl I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable.
cheryl Guess who?
ross Department of Sanitation?
cheryl It's me!
ross Oh! Ah. Aw!
cheryl What?
ross Ah, Cheryl!
cheryl Oh, Ross!
cheryl Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!
ross Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.
cheryl Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.
rachel I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!
gunther Move!
rachel Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!
phoebe Uh... yay!
rachel Thanks!
monica Oh, that's great! Congratulations!
rachel Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?
monica Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.
phoebe Yeah. I'm a hard ass.
monica And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.
phoebe Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!
monica Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!
phoebe Okay!
monica I can cook and you can take care of the money.
phoebe Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!
both Aah!

chandler Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?
joey Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.
chandler Oh yeah? That's great!
joey Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!
chandler Aahhuuhhh....

joey You know, uh... Chandler got you a gift, too.
chandler No he didn't.
joey Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!
chandler Happy birthday! I'm sorry.
kathy You really didn't have to. Wow.
chandler See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.
kathy Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler.
chandler Oh, yeah... yeah.
joey Ah. Hm. Wanna go to bed?
kathy I'll be in in a minute.
joey Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon.
chandler Goodnight.
kathy Um, thank you for the gift.
chandler Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.
kathy No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.
chandler Uh, the book?
kathy The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.
chandler What do you mean?
kathy Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.
chandler Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."
kathy You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.
chandler Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.
kathy Well....
chandler Goodnight.
joey Hey, that coupon expires, you know.
monica Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.
cheryl Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.
monica Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?
monica No?
