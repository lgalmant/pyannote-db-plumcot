monica What is it hon?
phoebe I-I can't find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! I'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake-ooh! Cake! No.
monica Aww, honey I'm sorry.
phoebe God! Ooh! What is that smell? It's coming from the bathroom. Ooh!
chandler Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.
joey Yeah?
phoebe It's me. It's Phoebe. Listen there's something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?
joey Is it the shampoo? It's guava.
phoebe No!
joey Oh! Wait-wait! Is it my bologna sandwich?
phoebe Yes. Yes. Yes. I can't believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I can't eat meat!
joey Oh, wait-wait! Maybe it's a pickle?!
chandler What are you writing?
rachel Well, Joshua's coming in tomorrow and since I don't have the guts to ask him out, I'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
chandler Oh yeah? Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you never go out of style-what did you throw away?
chandler Hi guys!
all Hey!
joey Hey, what have you guys been up too?
ross Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.
chandler Without me?!
emily My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.
ross Yeah.
emily They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that!
monica I don't know how museums work in England but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
emily I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. It's a joke.
ross Bye.
emily Right, I've got to be off, I'll see ya. Buh-bye then.
joey Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.
ross Oh yeah, she's-she's amazing. And-and she's so much fun. And! Y'know what? When I'm with her, I'm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. She's leaving in two days, I don't have to do it.
monica Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.
ross Yeah, she's got to go back to London. But you know what? I've been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and that's it. Y'know.
joey Hey that's what all my relationships are like.
chandler Yes, but in Ross's case, they both know in two weeks that's it.
ross Pheebs!
all Hey!
ross Hello! Hello!
phoebe Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, y'know? And I got nauseous.
chandler Maybe that's because soy-burgers suck!
phoebe Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.
joey Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.
phoebe That's sweat. You throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.
joshua Okay!
rachel Oh, here's that trench-coat that you wanted.
joshua Oh great! Wow! Yeah, it's comfortable.
rachel Yeah?
joshua Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing.
rachel Oh no-no, no-no, they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.
joshua Why not?!
rachel Well, that's because of a lot of
joshua Y'know, they ruin it for everybody.
rachel I know!
joshua Y'know, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.
rachel Oh?
joshua Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.
rachel Well, congratulations, so do you love her?
joshua No, no, no, she's nice but, y'know, it just it made me realize that I'm just not, I'm just not ready to be dating, y'know?
rachel Huh. Well, uh, that's uh, that's interesting.
joshua Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?
rachel Oh, it's just an anti-theft device.
joshua Then uh, what's-what's this?
rachel You need that, you need that too 'cause obviously, a thief could just tear this up.
rachel Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
chandler What are you talking about?
joey Yeah, what' going on?
rachel We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But it's actually for Joshua. Look, he said he's not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him!
ross Well, as much as I'd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I aren't going to be here. All right? I mean, she's going to come by first to say good-bye, and then I've got a whole special evening planned. So I'm sorry, no party.
joey Awwww!
emily Hello?
rachel Surprise!!!
chandler_and_joey Surprise!!
emily No one's ever thrown me a surprise party before!
rachel Well, it was all Ross's idea.
emily You're so sweet! And I'm so surprised!
ross You really didn't know?
chandler Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there?
rachel Uhh, because I'm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick he's looking over here, say something funny.
chandler Like what?
joey What-what-what is so funny?
chandler I said, "Like what?"
joey Now that's a thinker.
rachel Okay, y'know what, y'know what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. Okay. Okay. Hi!
joshua Hi!
rachel Care for a cherry?
joshua Oh, no thanks.
rachel No? Y'know, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.
joshua You okay? You all right?
ross So we should probably get going soon.
emily Oh, but the party's only just getting started!
ross Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then y'know, then The Plaza for dinner.
emily So why did you plan a party at the same time?
ross No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. It's usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, I'm so surprised-good-bye!"
emily But Ross, I'm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.
ross Monica said that did she?
phoebe Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?
joey A little salami.
phoebe Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?
joey Pastrami.
phoebe Oooh, yeah. You're a genius.
rachel Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?
joey Yeah.
rachel Up!
monica You changed?
rachel Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.
monica And lucky means, more cleavage?
chandler Does for me.
rachel Ohh, God! Look at him, he's so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?
joey Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.
rachel What?
joey There was a seen in Footloose...
chandler Flashdance.
joey Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girl
chandler She was a welder.
joey What? Were you like in the movie, or... Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.
monica Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.
rachel It's not Christmas!
monica Or Spin the Bottle?
rachel He's not 11!
emily Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.
rachel What? You're leaving?!
ross Yes, we have something we have to get to.
joshua Uhh, yeah, I think I'm going to take-off too.
rachel No! You guys can't leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!
ross What big thing?
rachel So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. All right. Who wants to go first?
emily I'll go.
all Yay!
joey Welcome to America.
monica Two in a row! You've got to use your tongues now!
rachel Yay! Emily!
chandler What are the odds? What are the odds?
ross Okay, that-that's enough! Y'know, let's, let's let someone else play.
joey If you didn't want to play, why did you come to the party?
rachel Okay, my turn!!
phoebe Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!
all Ohh!
rachel It's okay! It's okay! It kicked once, it'll kick again!
all Oh my God!
rachel All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.
rachel Just a bug.
phoebe Y'know it doesn't matter how much I'm craving it. Y'know why I'm never gonna eat meat? Because it's murder, cold blooded murder.
chandler Okay.
chandler There's a Phoebe on my sandwich!
joey Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!
phoebe I can't help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.
joey All right look, y'know how-y'know how when you're dating someone and you don't want to cheat on them, unless it's with someone really hot?
phoebe Yeah, totally!
joey All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If you're going to do something wrong, do it right!
joey Feel better now?
phoebe Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, I'm gonna eat like, y'know millions of cows.
joey Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.
phoebe What?
joey Well, I eat a lot of meat right?
phoebe Yeah.
joey Well, suppose until the baby's born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-you'd just be eating my animals.
phoebe Joey, I can't believe you would do that for me.
joey Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. There's no meat in beer, right?
ross Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.
emily But, we can't go now. It looks like Rachel's gonna put on a skit.
monica Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?
rachel No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasn't working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.
monica Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I can't let-, actually I kinda want to see what happens.
joshua Hey!
rachel Hi!
joshua Nice uh, costume.
rachel Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! Ready! Okay! Gimme an 'E!'
all E!
rachel Gimme an 'M!'
all M!
rachel Gimme an 'I!'
all I!
rachel Gimme an 'L!'
all L!
rachel Gimme a 'Y!'
all Y!
rachel What do you get? Emily!! Emil-Whoa!! Okay! So that's me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum!
joey_and_monica Are you all right?
rachel I'm fine! I'm fine! I'm just losing a tooth, it's no big deal. I have a dentist! Y'know. I'm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. What do I do now? What do I do now?
monica I think you're done.
joey Okay, time to take off the bra.
joshua Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.
joey Take the bra off.
rachel All right, come on, let's go get your coat.
joshua Okay.
gunther Rachel is my girlfriend.
joshua So, this was uh, really fun.
rachel Oh, yeah! Real fun. Y'know, this bra... Really, bothers me. Y'know, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, y'know what they'd say? Wanna hear some memories?
joshua Need uh, need a little hand there.
rachel Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.
joshua You really don't seem like you do. That's
rachel Ughhhh!! Forget it! This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.
joshua Well, what was supposed to happen?
rachel Can you not look at me when I say this? I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.
joshua Huh. Oh, boy! Uhh, I-I don't wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.
rachel Well, I'm sorry, I thought you needed them!
joshua No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.
rachel Why?!
joshua Because I-I like you.
rachel You like me?
joshua Yeah! I mean you're-you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated-a lot of this isn't based on tonight.
rachel Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I can't believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!
joshua But
rachel Oh no-no-no don't say but! No-no, but's never good! Let's just leave it at, you like me and I like you.
joshua Okay uh, however
rachel Oh, now see that's a fancy but.
joshua My marriage like just ended, and I'm really not ready to get into anything yet.
rachel But....
joshua I'm sorry, I, I just need a little time.
rachel Okay.
rachel Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshua's gone so you and Emily are free to go.
ross That's okay. She's still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, it's too late to do any of the things I had planned, so
rachel Oh, Ross, I'm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.
ross Yeah.
rachel Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.
ross Helps a little.
rachel Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?
ross Yeah, have a seat.
rachel I'm so sorry.
ross That's okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didn't want it to end this way, y'know?
rachel Well, maybe you didn't want it to end?
ross What do you mean?
rachel You seem to really like her.
ross Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
rachel Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
ross You think?
rachel Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
ross Hey, you're right.
rachel Yeah.
ross Thanks. What photo album was it?
rachel I don't know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.
ross Oh my God! Those weren't albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach!
rachel Hey.
chandler Hey.
rachel You're a pathetic loser, right?
chandler Oh-ho, yeah!
rachel Sit!
joshua Hi.
rachel Oh my gosh, Joshua!
joshua All those things I said about not being ready
rachel They're not true?
joshua No, they're-they're all true.
rachel Oh.
joshua But
rachel Oh! Oh, I love that but.
rachel You wanna go inside and have some coffee?
joshua Yeah.
rachel Okay. Every time.
joey Oooh, what you got there?
phoebe Pastrami.
joey Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Y'know what goes good with that?
phoebe Hm-mm, corn beef.
joey Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but that's much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?
phoebe Okay.
joey Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?
phoebe Six months.
joey Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?
phoebe Not if I get there first.
