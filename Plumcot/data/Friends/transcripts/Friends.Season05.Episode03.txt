phoebe_buffay Hi.
the_nurse Hi.
phoebe_buffay Hi, yeah, hi! I'm umm, Phoebe Buffay, and I have babies coming out of me.
the_nurse Okay. Have you started having contractions?
phoebe_buffay Not yet. Umm, I heard they really hurt, do they hurt?
the_nurse Well
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller It's all right.
the_nurse Now, which of you is the father?
phoebe_buffay Oh no, none of them are the father. The father is my brother.
the_nurse Okay
rachel_green I am so gonna miss watching you freak people out like that!
joey_tribbiani Okay, uh Pheebs, quick. Look! This is for the babies to look at someday, so is-is there anything you want to say? Y'know before it all starts?
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, umm, hi kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe. I can't wait to see you. Please don't hurt me!
dr_ross_geller Hey, what took you guys so long? Your cab left when ours did!
monica_geller Well, we-we had to go back because I forget my jacket.
chandler_bing That's right.
rachel_green You-you're not wearing a jacket.
monica_geller Oh man! I did it again!
phoebe_buffay Okay, so umm, somebody has to call Frank and Alice. And then my mom wants to know--Joey, what are you doing?!
joey_tribbiani I gotta get the before shot!
rachel_green Hi, Pheebs? Okay, so just spoke to the nurse and the reason that your doctor is late is because uh, she's not coming.
phoebe_buffay What?!
dr_ross_geller Apparently she fell in the shower and hit her head.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, she's so stupid!
dr_ross_geller Look, Pheebs-Pheebs, it's gonna be okay.
phoebe_buffay That's easy for you to say, I don't see three kids coming out your vagina!
rachel_green Honey, listen, y'know what? The nurse said the doctor is wonderful.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, he's head of the department.
phoebe_buffay All right - Ooh! Oh dead God, save me!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay I'm having my first contraction!
chandler_bing Oh no.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, it's not bad.
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani Oh! And so the miracle of life begins, and aaiiyyyeeee!
chandler_bing Hey! You okay?
joey_tribbiani Ooh, something hurts!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, it's sympathy pains. Ohh, that's so sweet!
joey_tribbiani Are they? I didn't know I cared that much.
dr_ross_geller Hello.
dr_harad Hi! Phoebe, I'm Dr. Harad, I'm going to be delivering your babies. I want you to know, you're gonna be in good hands. I've been doing this for a long time. I'll be back in a minute to do your internal, in the meantime, just relax because everything here looks great. And also, I love Fonzie.
chandler_bing Did he just say, he loves Fonzie?
monica_geller That's what it sounded like.
chandler_bing All right
frank_buffay_jr Hey!
all@ Hey!
frank_buffay_jr Hey! Am I late? Am I late? Nobody came out yet, right?
phoebe_buffay No-no-no! We haven't started yet. Where's Alice?
frank_buffay_jr Uh, Delaware. She's on her way though, so until she gets here, I'm gonna be your coach. But don't worry, she told me all about the la-Mazada stuff.
chandler_bing Yeah, that's when if you get the babies out by the end of the month, they give you 2% financing.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah.
rachel_green Monica? You gonna be very proud of me. I just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.
joey_tribbiani Oh my!
rachel_green They're male nurses.
joey_tribbiani Not in my head.
rachel_green Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?
monica_geller Umm. Umm. Umm. I don't think so.
rachel_green What? What are you talking about?! You-you're the one who's been telling me to get over Ross and move on. I'm moving on, and you're moving on with me. Come on, give me one good reason why you don't wanna go.
monica_geller Umm, why don't you give me something that would be a good reason and-and then I'll tell you if it's true.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller Harder than it sounds. Isn't it?
rachel_green Okay, you're coming with me, and I also told them that if we're still here when they get off that we'll go down to the cafeteria and have some Jell-O with them.
joey_tribbiani Yep! There's always room for Jell-O
rachel_green Joey, how do you make that dirty?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it's easy. Yeah, I-I can do it with anything. Watch uh, Grandma's chicken salad
joey_tribbiani Ross! Get a shot of this. Hey babies! These are the headlines on the day you were born! Okay, now girl baby turn away and boy babies... Check it out, huh?! This is what naked women looked like the month you were born. All right, now let's dive right into the good stuff.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, I'm having another one! This one doesn't hurt either - Ooh, yes it does! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ooh! Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it.
dr_ross_geller Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?
joey_tribbiani Oh, a couple of nurses asked them out. Maybe they're with them.
chandler_bing Really? Male nurses?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I was bummed too.
chandler_bing So they're going on dates? When?
joey_tribbiani I think Saturday - .
frank_buffay_jr What's with him?
phoebe_buffay Umm, sympathy pains. I thought it was really sweet at first, but now I think he's just trying to steal my thunder.
dr_harad Okay!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
dr_harad Let's see what we got here. Ohh, y'know, Fonzie dated triplets.
chandler_bing This-this Fonzie person you keep referring too, is that uh, is that another doctor?
dr_harad Oh no-no-no. Fonzie is the nickname of Arthur Fonzerelli. The Fonz.
chandler_bing All right.
frank_buffay_jr It's not that weird, is it?
phoebe_buffay It's very weird! I don't want some guy down there telling me, I'm y'know, dilatedamundo!
dr_ross_geller To be fair, he doesn't seem to be impersonating Fonzie
phoebe_buffay What are you doing?!! Why are you defending him?! Just get me another doctor! One who is not crazy and who is not Fonzie!
dr_ross_geller Again, it's not that he
chandler_bing Oh-hey-hey-hey! There you are!
monica_geller Umm, listen there's something I think you should know.
chandler_bing Oh, is this about you-you dating the nurse? Yeah, Joey already told me, and I am so-so fine. I mean, you and I we're just, y'know, we're nothing, we're goofin' around.
monica_geller Umm, actually I was about to tell you that I was, I was going to get out of it, but hey, if we're just goofing around then uh, maybe I will go out with him.
chandler_bing Fine! Maybe I will too!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you guys! Look what I found in the giiiiiiift shop. Get up! Get up! Get up!
dr_ross_geller Okay, Phoebe, this Dr. Oberman. He has no strong feelings about Fonzie or any of the Happy Days gang.
phoebe_buffay Hi! And you're going into what grade?
dr_oberman Umm, I'm actually a first year resident, but I get that a lot, you see, I-I graduated early
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, me too. Ross, maybe I should've specified that I'd be needing a grown up doctor.
dr_oberman Oh no, I'm fully qualified to
phoebe_buffay Shh! Doogie, shh! Doesn't anybody understand that I'm gonna be having babies soon? Huh? Go! Go little boy, go!
frank_buffay_jr Oh cool! You made him cry!
joeys_doctor Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid you've got kidney stones.
joey_tribbiani Umm, well, what else could it be?
joeys_doctor It's kidney stones.
joey_tribbiani Or?
joeys_doctor Kidney stones!
dr_harad All right, you're getting there. Oh, and y'know, these babies are very, very lucky.
phoebe_buffay They are. Why?
dr_harad They have the honor of being born on The Fonz's half-birthday.
phoebe_buffay Happy birthday!
dr_harad Just-just to clarify, I'm not Fonzie.
rachel_green Honey, y'know I just gotta tell you, I think this is such a terrific thing you're having these babies for Frank and Alice.
phoebe_buffay I know, it is.
rachel_green Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Can I tell you a little secret?
rachel_green Yeah!
phoebe_buffay I want to keep one.
rachel_green Ohh, I'm gonna be on the news!
rachel_green Okay, Phoebe, honey, you gotta be kidding. I mean, you know you cannot keep one of these babies!
phoebe_buffay Why not?! Maybe I can, you don't know!
rachel_green Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! I do know! Frank and Alice are gonna want to keep all of their children!
phoebe_buffay Maybe not! Y'know? Seriously, three babies are a handful maybe they're y'know, looking for a chance to unload one of them. Listen, I-I hate to miss an opportunity just because I didn't ask! Y'know?
rachel_green Phoebe, no! This is, this is insane.
phoebe_buffay Oh, just ask him!
rachel_green Me?!
phoebe_buffay I can't ask him! Do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be?! All I'm saying is just talk to Frank. Okay? Just, y'know, feel him out!
rachel_green No! Forget it! I am not gonna ask Frank to give you one of his kids!!
phoebe_buffay You're right.
phoebe_buffay Tell him it's for you.
monica_geller Feeling a little better sweetie?
joey_tribbiani Well, maybe a little. I wish you hadn't seen me throw up.
monica_geller Me too.
dr_ross_geller Hey! I just heard. What's up?
joeys_doctor Kidney stones! Now, ordinarily Mr. Tribbiani, we try to break up the stones up with shock waves, but they're to close to the bladder now. Which means we can either wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa! No-no-no-no-no, nothing is going up! Okay? Up, up is not an option - what's a urethra? Are you crazy?!
phoebe_buffay So did you ask him?
rachel_green No, I haven't had a chance to be alone with him yet.
phoebe_buffay Well, I'm kinda on a clock here.
dr_harad Oh Fonzie.
rachel_green Y'know who I always liked? Mork.
phoebe_buffay Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.
dr_harad Fonzie met Mork. Mork froze Fonzie.
rachel_green Yeah, but umm... Yes, but, Fonzie was already cool, so he wasn't hurt, right?
dr_harad Yeah, that's right.
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
monica_geller How are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Okay, doctor says any minute now.
frank_buffay_jr Hey, y'know, Alice is gonna be here so soon, you couldn't just like do me a favor and like, like hold them in?
phoebe_buffay Sorry Frank, I'm kinda in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.

frank_buffay_jr Hey, where's his thing?

joey_tribbiani They're so small!
dan So, I'll call you tomorrow.
monica_geller Great!
chandler_bing So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
monica_geller Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not goof around with him.
chandler_bing Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am so bad at this.
monica_geller I think you're better than you think you are.
chandler_bing Really? Okay, so
monica_geller Know when to stop.
chandler_bing Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
monica_geller Yeah. All right, I'm gonna go tell Dan that it's not gonna happen. Don't do the dance.
chandler_bing Right!
monica_geller I think you're my favorite.
phoebe_buffay Which one do you have?
monica_geller I don't care.
rachel_green Hi. Hey, hi! So uh, Frank and Alice wanted me to tell you that they're still outside making phone calls.
phoebe_buffay But umm, I mean, did you talk to them about, y'know
rachel_green Yeah, umm, no honey.
phoebe_buffay Oh. It was a long shot. Hey, you guys can I just like have a second alone with the babies.
all@ Yeah, sure yeah. Yeah.
phoebe_buffay So, here you are. It seems like yesterday I was talking to you in that little petri dish. Everyone said labor was the hardest thing I'd ever have to do, but they were wrong this is. Oh, I had the most fun with you guys! I wish I could take you home and see you everyday. Okay, I'll settle for being your favorite Aunt. I know Alice's sister has a pool, but you lived in me. Okay, so we're cool. Yeah, we're gonna be great. Little high fives! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Well, if you're gonna cry.
monica_geller Phoebe, we are so proud of you! You're amazing!
phoebe_buffay I know.
rachel_green So does it really hurt as bad as they say?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. You won't be able to take it.
chandler_bing So uh, now that little Chandler turned out to be a girl, what are they gonna name her?
phoebe_buffay They're gonna call her Chandler.
chandler_bing That's kind of a masculine name, don't you think?
phoebe_buffay Works on you.
