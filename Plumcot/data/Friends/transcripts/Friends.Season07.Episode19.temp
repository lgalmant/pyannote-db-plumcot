phoebe Oh hey! How was your audition?
joey I'm sorry, do I know you?
phoebe What are you doing?
joey Nothing, I'm just practicing blowing you off because I'm gonna be a big movie star!
phoebe Oh! You got it?!
joey Well, no not yet. But the audition went really good.
monica What was it for?
joey Oh, it's this big budget period movie about these three Italian brothers who come to America around the turn of the century. It's really classy! Oh, and the director is supposed to be the next, next Martin Scorcese.
phoebe The next, next?
joey Yeah, there's this guy from Chicago who's supposed to be the next Martin Scorcese, all right? But then this guy's right after him. Hello!
estelle Joey! It's Estelle! I just talked to the casting people; they loved you!
joey They loved me!
estelle Yeah, they wanna see you again tomorrow.
joey Oh my God!
estelle There's just one thing. Do you have a problem with full frontal nudity?
joey Are you kidding me? I never rent a movie without it! Oh. Uh, okay uh let me call you back.
phoebe What's the matter?
joey They want me to be totally naked in the movie!
monica Wow!
joey I know! My grandmother's gonna see this!
phoebe Grandma's gonna have to get in line.
phoebe Hey the wedding is so close! Are you getting nervous?
monica Yeah. But a part of me also can't wait 'til it's over. Chandler and I have this pact not to have sex again until the wedding.
ross A no sex pact huh? I actually have one of those going on with every woman in America.
monica Hey Phoebe, will you give me a hand?
phoebe Sure.
monica I gotta make up the guest bedroom. Hey, Cousin Cassie is coming to stay with us a few days.
ross Cassie?
monica Uh-hmm.
ross Wow, I haven't seen her for like forever. I wonder if she still carries that Barbie everywhere she goes.
monica Ross, she's 25 years old.
ross So what! I still have-No you're probably right.
rachel Hi!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey Pheebs, can I talk to you over here for a second?
phoebe Yeah!
monica Subtle guys!
phoebe What?!
monica I know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.
rachel Well okay-Well don't ruin it! Just play along at least!
monica Okay. Sorry.
rachel Oh my God! We have to throw her a shower?!
monica Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
joey I don't know! It's not like it's porn! This is a serious, legitimate movie. Y'know? And the nudity is really important to the story.
monica That's what you say about porn.
joey You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
monica No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!
joey Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.
monica Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.
phoebe Well when can we have this shower?
rachel She has got so much going on we-we have only two options. We have Friday
phoebe Well that's only two days away. What is the other option?
rachel Yesterday!
phoebe Well if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo! We're done!
rachel Oh my God Phoebe, this is impossible! We can't do this by Friday! We have to find a place. We have to invite people! We have to get food! There's just too much to do! It's impossible! We can't do it! We cannot do it! We cannot do it!
phoebe Rachel, calm down!
rachel Okay. I'm sorry. You're right, you're right.
phoebe Just calm down woman!
rachel Phoebe, I already, I already did.
phoebe Oh okay. All right, then I need to calm down a little.
rachel Okay. Okay. I think we can do this if we just get organized. All right? We have two days to plan this party. We just need to make fast decisions! Okay? All right, where are we gonna have it?
phoebe Uh, here. What time?
rachel 4 o'clock. Food?
phoebe Finger sandwiches and tea.
rachel Ooh great! Very Monica.
phoebe And chili!
rachel Ah you went one too far. Uh, flowers or balloons?
phoebe Both!
rachel We're paying for this y'know.
phoebe Neither.
rachel Okay. Umm, what should we do for the theme?
phoebe Lusts of the flesh.
rachel What?
phoebe I don't know. A cowboy theme?
chandler Hey!
monica Hey!
chandler Y'know I'm-I'm really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.
monica Oh boy me too!
chandler Y'know I was thinking if we had a...a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours
monica Yeah?
chandler Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!
monica The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!
chandler That's me! Come on!
monica Okay. But wait, we can't. My Cousin Cassie is in the guest room, we're supposed to have lunch.
chandler Well get rid of her, obsessive and shrill.
monica Shrill?! The wedding is back on!
cassie I thought I heard voices. You must be Chandler.
chandler Hi! Nice to meet you!
cassie Nice to meet you too.
monica So, are you ready to go?
cassie Yeah.
monica Chandler!
chandler I'll be right with you.
monica Cassie needs to stay at your place.
ross What-why?
monica Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.
ross What?! Chandler she's our cousin!
chandler I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.
monica You were staring about eight inches south of there.
ross Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.
monica She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.
chandler Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?
monica Wafer thin ice!
joey Hey, I'm back!
the_casting_director Hi-hi Joey.
joey Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?
the_casting_director Actually, I tried to call to you. You didn't need to come down here today.
joey Oh great! Y'know I would've been perfect for this part, but whatever! Y'know, thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie! Good day!
the_casting_director Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it.
joey And scene! Huh? Wasn't that fun? We did a little improv there. Yeah! Okay! So you-you-you-you were saying?
the_casting_director Well, the director thinks you're really right for the part and wants to meet you tomorrow.
joey Wow! Sure! That's great!
the_casting_director Oh and your agent said you were okay with the nudity.
joey Yeah! Yeah sure, just long as it's handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold.
the_casting_director Terrific! Well uh, there's one more thing. Uhh, uh it's really important to the director that everything in this movie is authentic. Yeah and so in your love scene with Sarah she talks about how she's never seen a naked man who wasn't Jewish. So
joey So...What?
the_casting_director So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?
joey Yes!
the_casting_director Okay.
joey No. What?
the_casting_director An Italian Catholic immigrant at this time would not be
joey Barmifsaed?
monica So to get this part you can't be?
joey Nope.
monica But you are?
joey Yep.
monica But you told them you weren't?
joey That's right.
monica Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?
joey I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.
monica Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!
joey I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.
monica Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!
joey I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.
monica Unless!
joey Unless what?
monica Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.
joey Like what?
monica Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.
phoebe Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.
rachel Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.
phoebe Okay. Okay! Well okay, who do we know that's coming? Me. Are you?
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey! What's up Mon?
monica Well uh, I'm trying to make something for Joey. Do you mind if I raid your fridge?
rachel Have at it.
monica Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.
rachel Are you makin' him a sandwich?
monica No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.
phoebe_and_rachel Okay.
monica I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!
rachel We have to get her a present?!
phoebe Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!
rachel Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?
phoebe Uh-huh, and a little seed money for the party.
ross Cassie?!
cassie Hey Ross!
ross Hey!
cassie It's been so long! Last time I saw you, you were setting up your tent in line to see Return of the Jedi.
ross Oh. Oh, that's right. So-so you did see me that day because it seemed like you didn't.
cassie Ah yeah, sorry about that.
ross It's okay. Come, come on in.
cassie Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot.
ross Oh.
cassie Oh my God! You do a great Chandler!
ross Uh-huh. Yeah I-I have a knack for impressions.
cassie Well, maybe after we get reacquainted uh, you can do me.
ross Yeah-No!!
ross Cassie, how you-how you doin' on that...hot dog.
cassie I'm all done.
ross Thank God.
cassie I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together.
ross Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now.
cassie I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles.
ross Uh-huh! Uh-huh! And-and-and I'll always remember that summer because that's when I realized that we are related.
cassie It took you that long to figure it out, huh?
ross Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.
phoebe Hi!
woman Hi!
phoebe How are you? Good. Hi, thanks for coming.
woman Oh thank you.
phoebe Thank you. No? All right. Oh, it's so nice to see you.
woman No.
the_other_woman No thanks.
phoebe Okay. Hey Rach?
rachel Yeah?
phoebe Who the hell are all these people?
rachel Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice.
phoebe Hmm, y'know there's another word for people like that. Losers!
rachel Hi! I'm Rachel. This is Phoebe. I'm the maid of honor. How do you know Monica?
woman I was her accountant four years ago.
rachel Ohhhh!
woman I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years.
rachel That's great!
woman So, what time is Monica supposed to get here?
phoebe_and_rachel I don't know.
rachel Excuse us for a minute. You didn't tell her to come?!
phoebe You were supposed to tell her!
rachel No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!
phoebe Fine, I'll go call her.
rachel Yes! And please tell her to bring a cake!
monica Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on.
joey Wow! This looks great!
monica Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna.
joey And-and-and-and-and the toothpicks?
monica Oh, just until the glue dries.
joey Thank God!
monica Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.
joey Ah.
monica Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink.
joey Well maybe we just take that one away.
monica I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work.
joey Thanks, you are such a good friend. And this is so weird.
joey Ow!
monica Toothpick?
joey Yeah.
monica What are you trying on now?
joey The fruit roll up.
monica And?
joey Delicious.
monica Joey!
joey Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We have a winner!
monica What?! Which one?!
joey The Silly Putty! It's not so silly anymore!
ross She's your cousin. She's your cousin! If she knew what was going on in your head she'd think you were sick! Or would she? Let's back up a second. She was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine. She was the one who turned down the lights. She was the one that wanted to rent Logan's Run, the sexiest movie ever. Oh, I know that look. Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.
cassie Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
ross Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever! There is nothing you can say to make this worse!! So just say something!! I-I, I uh haven't had sex in a very long time. Yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.
monica Phoebe! Rachel! It's Monica! I wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice! Oh.
rachel Oh Monica, we are so sorry.
monica For what?
rachel Well first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.
phoebe And then for forgetting to invite you to it.
monica You al-you already had it?
phoebe Yeah. Well, we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came, but it took us so long to get you here that they-they had to leave.
rachel Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either.
phoebe We ruined everything.
rachel Ugh
monica Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best.
rachel What do you, what do you mean?
monica Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!
rachel Surprise
phoebe Sur-surprise.
rachel ...Monica.
joey And what's cool is, the character is from Naples, right?
the_director Yeah.
joey My whole family's from Naples!
the_director Oh that's great! Okay, well I've heard everything I need to hear. I just need to uh, Leslie
the_casting_director Joey, this is awkward part.
joey Oh! Hey right! Not a problem. I totally understand. You need to y'know make sure I don't have any horrible scars or tattoos. Don't you worry; I have nothing to hide. So there you go, that's me. One hundred percent natural! I tell ya, that has never happened before.
phoebe Cassie, are you finding everything okay in there?
cassie Yeah! Thank you so much for letting me stay here.
phoebe Oh! No problem! I
cassie What?
phoebe Say something! Say anything! Ask her out! She's not your cousin!
