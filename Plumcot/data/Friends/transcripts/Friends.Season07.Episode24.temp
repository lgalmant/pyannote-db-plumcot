conan It's a tradition here on Friends after every taping for me to hang out with you guys, talk down the episode umm... The point of this whole thing is what people see in America is
jennifer Once and a while.
lisa From time to time.
conan For example, I don't have to memorize lines. You guys actually have to remember what to say and you probably forget from time to time. Yes?
matthew Our energy just comes way up when there's an audience here and when that happens, something happens between your brain and your mouth sometimes and it just doesn't, it just doesn't work.
ross Uh, oh-oh, umm no you didn't. I did.
chandler Oh uh-uh, no-no-no-no-uh-uh.
phoebe So, we realize that - Oh no... I'm telling it! I'm telling it
joey Ha-ha. Look - Come on, I don't know what to do... or say.
joey Ha-ha, very funny. I don't know what to do! Y'know? Holy crud!
joey Ha-ha-ha, very funny. Look, I don't know what to do!
courtney It is one of those days!
matt Wow Pheebs, you-you speak gutter?
conan You still get nervous everybody just before a show?
matthew Absolutely.
lisa Everybody.
courtney It's amazing like all week long we've-we've been saying the same lines and then the audience is here and we will mess up, and if you mess up once, then you'll get nervous because you'll - you know you'll probably mess up again.
the_director Action!
monica When you were little you slept through-through the Grand Canyon.
the_director Watch again that hand.
courtney This'll be five/ten takes.
the_director Okay.
courtney Okay. You know it's gonna happen.
the_director Once again, and action!
monica When-when you were little you slept through the Grand Canyon.
courtney Oh! Okay! I'm gonna try it without the coffee cup 'cause I think it's the left hand that's messing me up.
monica When you were little you slept through the Grand - - Oh fffff... .
monica Sorry, let's go back! 'Cause you've got more to say.
lisa Do I? Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, that's your fault. I... say.
lisa I love you.
courtney I love you!
conan But there must be, there must - are a lot of moments over the years where you're just trying to do your job, something goes wrong.
joey Hey and, this is a little extra something for y'know, always being there for me.
matthew Hey Joey! The camera hit our wall!
matt What?!
david Ahh! Sh - - it that hurt!
jennifer Are you okay?
chandler Hey Rach!
joey Oh yeah? Then how come I keep - 
monica It was so wild! We told 'em we were the Gunderson's in 16
courtney I spit on her!
jennifer Operation. You had a fun one.
lisa Oh yeah!
jennifer With Operation.
conan It was a little game. Yeah, with an electric buzzer.
phoebe Oh-ooh, and I brought Operation, but umm I lost the umm... It's making a noise.
lisa But le Blanc really doesn't mess up much.
conan You don't verbally mess up, but sometimes physically? You mess up.
matt I have had some clumsy moments I guess you can call 'em.
lisa He fell down once! And we re-did it and we went back. And he - - he was afraid he was gonna fall down
conan You could actually see him trying not to fall down.
joey Pheebs! Check it out!
courtney This particular time when he continued to fall or y'know, try not to fall, I was in the room with Matthew and Matthew was like, "Should I do it?"
joey Pheebs! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out! Check it out!
phoebe Ooh, Soap Opera Digest!
conan Matthew, you have a reputation with the rest of the cast that sometimes you like to, you like to fool around a bit. I mean like if something's naturally going wrong you like to get in there and juice it a little bit. True or false?
matthew I don't necessarily like to juice things
courtney He said true or false!
joey Oh! Ooh-ooh!
monica What are you doing?!
joey You're still a tiny bit on fire there.
monica Oh geez! Okay! Thanks!
richard It was great seeing you the other night.
monica Well, it was good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?
richard Noo! I came down here to tell you something else. I came here to tell you I still love you.
chandler What the fu - - ck are you doing?!
conan Now you guys work with animals a lot. You had to work early on with a monkey
jennifer That damn monkey.
conan That damn monkey.
rachel Okay. Okay, see now the one with the feather boa? That's Dr. Francis. She used to be a man. Oh look! There - (Marcel jumps away) - Okay.
jennifer Katie. Geez! See Katie, come here - Katie! Katie, come here Katie. Very good.
jennifer Lisa's laugh though... There's - It's so infectious. It's one of those things... just forget about it. Once it starts, it's all gone.
rachel No y'know, I don't want to switch! Come on! I can throw wet paper towels here!
phoebe Well at Monica's you can eat - 
lisa Okay, shh yeah. 'Cause it's not silly.
the_director Here we go.
jennifer Okay.
the_director And... action!
rachel No-no Ph-Ph-Ph-Ph
jennifer Ready?
lisa Yeah.
conan And then it just builds on itself and there's no doing the scene after. I mean you probably wait and really get it together and do it.
david For me, I have a hard time with le Blanc in particular. When-when - I mean when
conan You bastard.
matt Yeah, what did I do?
david I keep a straight face he-he delivers like this look, a reaction to you, or a certain take, I-I - I mean I find it so funny.
joey Mornin'
ross Mornin'
joey I mean what kind of an actor, what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup?"
matt That's a good one?
david Now, we should go back and take the other line.
matt Okay, I'll just put a little more booze on there.
ross I think, subconsciously
joey Nope, you lost me.
david No! Come on!
joey Okay, the next situation is for Rachel. The wedding is about to start you walk into the back room and you find Monica taking a nap with Ross. I'll be Monica. Go!
ross No! No! No!
conan We'll be right back with more Friends, less me.
courtney I'm doing my brother.
matthew That's... gross.
conan You uh, you've worked with - They always say a performer should never work with pets or children.
jennifer Aww, the kids.
the_director Action.
rachel Okay. Now - What is my first line?
ben What did we agree?
jennifer Okay
david The good thing about the young kids though, they're completely unpredictable. Which is a lot of fun as an actor to respond with. But there was one story
jennifer Oh little Ben.
david Where the story was that I was anticipating that I would be around to hear my son's first words spoken. But the scene was about that he wasn't supposed to be able to speak and, uh for some reason when we started doing the show
ross Hi! We're visiting!
rachel Yay!
ross It's Ben and his Da-Da. Da-Da? Can you say Da-Da? Y'know, you might as well say it because I told your
ben Da... Da.
ross Can you say Da-Da? See, I'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway, so you might as well try
ben Da... Da.
ross Huh?
ben Da... Da.
david Yeah, he's saying Da-Da.
matt And then sometimes during the show y'know but you're like, the scene's going one way but you're just tempted to say something another time. Like, do you remember that one where Monica's baking cookies in our old apartment?
jennifer She's trying to intrigue us to hang out with her.
matt Yeah, she's trying to waft the smell across the hall to get us to come hang out in her new place, and we're sitting there eating pizza and I think it was you that said
phoebe What do I smell?
matt I think I was supposed to say, "I don't know," and go over and open the door. And I went
phoebe What do I smell?
joey Sorry.
matt And then it was like four takes later before we could get through it with a straight face.
phoebe What do I smell?
david Le Blanc.
phoebe What do I smell?
joey I don't know, but it smells good.
conan But audiences - You have a live studio audience and they must love that. They must love it when they see you guys playing.
chandler What are you guys doing?
ross Nothing.
joey Nothin'.
conan So that you will intentionally do something that - they'll-they'll intentionally screw it up?
courtney Yeah!
david Yeah!
matt Why? What's the matter?
conan You-you've worn a fat suit on the show. And, a lot of people love you in the fat suit. Do you like wearing the fat suit? Is it fun?
courtney I'm melting!
courtney They made me dance, in the fat suit.
conan I-I heard some of you guys talking about this earlier, but sometimes there's just a word that someone has to say that you'll get hung up on. And it'll just - the way you say the word is funny to everybody else.
ross That tastes like feet!
matt It tastes like feet!
david Okay, we're good.
the_director Action!
ross That tastes like feet!
matt Sometimes the dialogue itself is just so funny and you'll - we'll be rehearsing during the week and you just - whatever-whatever the joke is; it's so funny we can't get through it in rehearsal and just
jennifer You just know.
matt You-you mentally make a flag on it and you say, "Okay show night, I'm just - I'll never be able to get through this."
monica Are you saying that you don't want to get with this?
chandler You see, I don't say - 
phoebe Oh, sweet Je - - sus! Oh! Monica, these are the cookies they serve in hell!
chandler Whoa! She's purty!
joey Oh yeah, and she's really nice too! She taught me about y'know, how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.
monica Joey?
rachel I'm sorry
ross Excuse me, what?
conan When you have to do physical business for a scene, I mean there must be; there must be a lot of funny moments when you have to physically do a task as part of a scene.
david Yeah, Rachel, Chandler, and Ross had to try to get a couch up a stair - a very narrow New York stairwell and that was probably... I-I think it was the hardest I've-I've laughed in my life period.
ross Pivot! Pivot! Okay, pivot! Piv-at!
ross Pivot! Piv-at! Piv-at!!
chandler Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!
david Pivat!! Pivat!!!
conan You've done over 150 episodes, but your favorite moments that 80 years from now you'll be thinking about?
matthew It is when we're able to crack each other up.
chandler Monica's gotta have the phone in the right place and - 
ross All right! All right! All right! We are fixing it.
david He's gone. He's
david We enjoy watching each other. And I settle for watching each other's performance, and we like each other.
ross Oh the band's ready! And well - I-I - we gotta do what the band says, right? I don't care about the stinkin' band!!
conan Okay Friends gang, thanks for doing it.
david Well thank you so much.
jennifer Thank you Conan!
matthew Well thank for coming here, it's good to see you.
phoebe Thank you my babies.
monica Oh what are doing?!
joey You're still a tiny bit on fire there!
monica I think you got it!
courtney I'm sorry, I messed up.
matt I'll do it again and again if you want.
ross No-no! I'll-I'll
david That is too much!
matthew Let me start that again.
