rachel_green Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
woman#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode15 Chandler.
chandler_bing Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
mrs_tedlock#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode15 Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day.
chandler_bing Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
chandler_bing Hey!
all@ Hey!
phoebe_buffay Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
all@ What is it?
chandler_bing So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
all@ That's great!
chandler_bing So.... I quit.
all@ Why?
chandler_bing Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
monica_geller Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
chandler_bing If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
phoebe_buffay So was it a lot more money?
chandler_bing It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
rachel_green .. the WENUS?
chandler_bing Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
rachel_green Oh. That WENUS.
joey_tribbiani So what're you going to do?
chandler_bing I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
phoebe_buffay Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
monica_geller Um... hi there.
phoebe_buffay Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
chandler_bing Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah!
monica_geller Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
phoebe_buffay Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know! So, what do you think?
chandler_bing Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
phoebe_buffay OK. Oh Monica! Guess what!
chandler_bing Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
rachel_green No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
phoebe_buffay Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
chandler_bing Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the "a-gogo."
rachel_green Career counselor?
chandler_bing Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
rachel_green I don't!
chandler_bing Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
dr_ross_geller Ah, the lesser-known "I don't have a dream" speech.
monica_geller Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! Brian's Song!
rachel_green The meeting with the guy went great?
monica_geller So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
chandler_bing Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
monica_geller So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
rachel_green What are you going to make?
phoebe_buffay Yummy noises.
rachel_green And Monica, what are you going to make?
monica_geller I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
phoebe_buffay Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
joey_tribbiani How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
dr_ross_geller OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
chandler_bing Who are you going out with?
phoebe_buffay Oh, is this the bug lady?
rachel_green Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
rachel_green So what are you guys going to do?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
chandler_bing And he's not speaking metaphorically.
joey_tribbiani So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... huh-huh?
dr_ross_geller Well, I don't know.... huh-huh.... but I'm hoping huh-huh.
joey_tribbiani I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
dr_ross_geller Celia, don't worry! Don't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
celia I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
dr_ross_geller Alright...
monica_geller OK, try this salmon mousse.
joey_tribbiani Mmmm. Good.
monica_geller Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
joey_tribbiani It's creamier.
monica_geller Yeah, well, is that better?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
rachel_green My God! What happened to you?
chandler_bing Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
phoebe_buffay That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
chandler_bing Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
rachel_green Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
monica_geller Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
chandler_bing Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
monica_geller It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
chandler_bing Well.... it is amouz-ing...
monica_geller Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
phoebe_buffay Ten dollars an hour for what?
monica_geller Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
rachel_green Waitressing?
joey_tribbiani Uh-oh.
monica_geller Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
rachel_green But, but?
monica_geller But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
rachel_green Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
chandler_bing You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. Amouz-bouche?
celia Talk to me.
dr_ross_geller OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
celia No no no. Talk... dirty.
dr_ross_geller Wha... what, here?
celia Yes...
dr_ross_geller Ah....
celia Say something..... hot.
dr_ross_geller Er.... um.....
celia What?
dr_ross_geller Um... uh.... vulva.
joey_tribbiani Vulva?
dr_ross_geller Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
joey_tribbiani Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
dr_ross_geller Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
joey_tribbiani What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
dr_ross_geller Please be kidding.
joey_tribbiani Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
dr_ross_geller OK. I'm in my apartment...
joey_tribbiani ...yeah... what else?
dr_ross_geller That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
joey_tribbiani Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
dr_ross_geller Joey, please.
joey_tribbiani Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
dr_ross_geller Wow.
joey_tribbiani Alright, now you say something.
dr_ross_geller I... ahem... I really don't think so.
joey_tribbiani Come on! You like this woman, right?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani You want to see her again, right?
dr_ross_geller Sure.
joey_tribbiani Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
dr_ross_geller OK, turn around. I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
joey_tribbiani Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
dr_ross_geller Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
joey_tribbiani There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
dr_ross_geller I, er...
dr_ross_geller I want to take my tongue... and...
dr_ross_geller ...and....
joey_tribbiani Say it... say it!
dr_ross_geller ..run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
chandler_bing ...with??
dr_ross_geller Funny story!
joey_tribbiani You're not going to believe this!
chandler_bing It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
joey_tribbiani Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
chandler_bing Again?
joey_tribbiani And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again.
chandler_bing Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday!
chandler_bing Well?
phoebe_buffay Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
chandler_bing Look at this!
phoebe_buffay Oh! You have a window!
chandler_bing Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of...
phoebe_buffay Oh look! That guy's peeing!
chandler_bing OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
phoebe_buffay OK.
chandler_bing This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
chandler_bing Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
chandler_bing Last time I do that, I promise.
monica_geller Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!
rachel_green Who was that?
monica_geller Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
rachel_green Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
monica_geller Ten dollars an hour.
rachel_green No.
monica_geller Twelve dollars an hour.
rachel_green Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
monica_geller You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour.
rachel_green Done.
rachel_green Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
monica_geller Hi Steve!
steve Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl.
monica_geller This is Rachel.
steve Yeah, OK.
phoebe_buffay Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells.
steve It's a lovely apartment.
monica_geller Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
steve I was just being polite, but, alright.
rachel_green What's up?
phoebe_buffay In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
rachel_green OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
steve Is it dry in here?
rachel_green Let me, let me get you some wine!
monica_geller Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce..... with just a touch of mints... and..... ginger.
steve Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
monica_geller I'm so glad you liked them!
steve Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
monica_geller Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
steve Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
rachel_green Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
steve You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
steve Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
monica_geller You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
steve Hey! Sugar-O's!
monica_geller You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
steve Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
monica_geller No, we don't.
steve Oh, OK. Oh, sorry.
monica_geller Why don't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
steve No.
monica_geller Give them to me.
steve Alright, we'll share.
monica_geller No, give me the...
steve Well then you can't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself! "Help! I'm drowning! Help!"
monica_geller That's it! Dinner is over!
steve What?
monica_geller What?
steve Why?
monica_geller Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
steve Hey!
joey_tribbiani What a tool!
rachel_green You don't want to work for a guy like that.
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
monica_geller I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
dr_ross_geller Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
joey_tribbiani So, er... how did it go with Celia?
dr_ross_geller Oh, I was unbelievable.
joey_tribbiani All right, Ross!
dr_ross_geller I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
joey_tribbiani Whoa! And the... huh-huh?
dr_ross_geller Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
joey_tribbiani You cuddled.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, which was nice.
phoebe_buffay You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
rachel_green Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, where the hell is he?
chandler_bing Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa....
phoebe_buffay How's this?
steve Eeeee!
phoebe_buffay Sorry. How about over here?
steve Aaaaah!
phoebe_buffay See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt?
steve No.
phoebe_buffay What about this?
steve Aaaaahhh!!
phoebe_buffay There you go!
