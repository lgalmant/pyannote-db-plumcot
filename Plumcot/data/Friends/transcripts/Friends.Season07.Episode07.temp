joey Morning!
rachel Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
joey Pretty good.
rachel Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
joey Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
rachel What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
joey Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
rachel Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
joey Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
rachel Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
joey Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
rachel Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
joey Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
joeys_date Hi!
rachel Hi.
joeys_date Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
rachel Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
joeys_date You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
rachel Hi.
erin Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
rachel Would you like some pancakes?
chandler ...Come on! Why are we here?!
ross Okay, okay take a guess.
chandler The hot chicks?
ross Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
chandler Wow that's actually pretty cool.
ross Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
chandler Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
female_student I'm so sorry!
male_student Sorry!
chandler You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
monica She sent the chicken back again?!
the_waitress She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
monica Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
the_colonel OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
monica Lucky bastard! Janice.
janice How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
monica I'm fine.
janice Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
monica Oh... Uh
janice So, who's the lucky guy?
chandler OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
monica Well, she saw the ring.
chandler Did she freak out?
monica Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
chandler Right.
monica Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
chandler You said no right?
monica Huh?
chandler You said no right?!
monica Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
chandler Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
monica Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
chandler What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
monica Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
chandler Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
monica Really?
chandler No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
monica So-so you would've just lied?
chandler Yes!!
monica Would it really have been that easy?
chandler Yes!!!
monica Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.

rachel Cupid.
phoebe Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.

rachel Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
joey My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
phoebe Yeah, but you always say that.
rachel Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
joey Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
phoebe Whatever.
rachel Fine.
joey Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
rachel Phoebe!
phoebe Secret affair!
ross People are doing it in front of my book!
rachel I'm sorry?
ross My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
rachel Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
ross Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
rachel Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
ross Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
joey Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
ross Oh for cryin' out loud!
joey All right, so we should go catch our movie.
rachel Well now what's the rush?
joey I like to see the previews. The candy.
phoebe Oh. Hey!
rachel Well look who's here!
erin Hey!
joey Hey!
erin Joey.
joey Erin.
erin Hey Rachel.
rachel Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
erin What's wrong?
rachel Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
phoebe Oh no.
joey What party?
phoebe_and_rachel A birthday party.
joey Who's birthday party?
phoebe_and_rachel Allison's birthday party.
joey Oh, and how is Allison?
phoebe_and_rachel 32.
rachel Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
joey Yeah, look how that worked out.
ross Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
the_librarian Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
ross No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
the_head_librarian How can I help you?
ross Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
the_head_librarian We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
ross Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
joey Hey.
phoebe Hey!
rachel How did it go with Erin?
joey Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
phoebe Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
joey No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
phoebe Didn't you sleep together?
joey Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a
rachel Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
joey Okay.
janice Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
monica He might still show up.
janice Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
monica Is that all?
janice I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
chandler Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
monica It's actually going to be just family.
janice Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
joey How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
erin What about Benitez?
joey What about Game 1 of the Series?
erin What about shut up?
joey You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
erin Okay.
rachel So how's it goin' with Joey?
erin Uh, okay.
rachel Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
erin Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
rachel But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
erin Kinda.
phoebe Then change it back!
erin I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
phoebe No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
erin Yeah.
rachel Ugh, tramp!
phoebe Does Joey have any idea?
erin I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
phoebe Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
erin Yeah! That would be great!
phoebe Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
erin I'm sorry?
phoebe Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
joey Hey! You wanna go?
erin Yeah, let's go.
joey Okay. See you guys later.
erin Bye guys.
rachel Yeah, see ya.
joey Hey, thank you so much.
rachel Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
phoebe No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
ross Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
guy Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
ross Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
guy Uhh....
ross Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
woman Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
ross I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
woman I'm sorry, who are you?
ross I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
woman Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
ross Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
woman Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
ross Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
ross I am very...very sorry.
joey Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hi!
phoebe So how was, how was your date?
joey Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
phoebe Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
joey No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
phoebe_and_rachel Oh no, yeah.
rachel Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
joey Where are you gettin' this?
rachel Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
joey Oh. Oh.
rachel Joey
joey No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
phoebe Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
rachel Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
joey No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
rachel Well that too. Joey?
joey Yeah?
rachel Do you want some pancakes?
joey Finally!
monica What are we gonna do?
chandler I say we go with Careless Whisper.
janice Chandler?
chandler Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
monica Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
janice Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
monica Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
janice Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
chandler Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
janice Do you have any tissues?
monica Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
janice Okay!
monica We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
chandler No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
monica Kinda like your Barca lounger.
chandler Is that what you're thinking about right now?
monica I never stop thinking about it.
janice Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
chandler Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
janice Why not?
chandler Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
janice Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
monica Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
janice Why?
monica Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
janice He does?
chandler Say again?
monica That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
chandler Feelings, such strong feelings.
monica I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
janice Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
ross Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
chandler I just wanted to show Monica your book.
