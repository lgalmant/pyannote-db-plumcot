joey_tribbiani Okay, pick a card.
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani All right now, memorize it. You got it?
chandler_bing Oh yes.
joey_tribbiani Is that your card?
chandler_bing Yes.
carol_willick Hey guys!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
chandler_bing Hi there!
ben_geller Hi!!
carol_willick Guess what? Ben is going to be in a TV commercial!
phoebe_buffay What are you talking about?!
dr_ross_geller Well, it's not for sure but umm, we met this guy in the park who thought Ben was really cute--y'know, which he is--so umm anyhoo, he uh, he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he's auditioning.
joey_tribbiani Whoa! This guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town! Ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition!! I mean, way to go Ben! Man! I've been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition.
dr_ross_geller I know, it's crazy! We were just pushing Ben on the swings
joey_tribbiani I'm always on the swings! What am I doing wrong?!
chandler_bing That.
rachel_green Okay, gotta go! Wish me luck!
joey_tribbiani Luck!
chandler_bing Hey Rach, now that you're working at Ralph Lauren, can you bring me back some of those polo shirts?
rachel_green Uh well, y'know what? I don't think if I feel comfortable stealing on my very first day
chandler_bing Unwilling to steal from work, interesting.
monica_geller Besides, if anybody's gonna get free stuff, it's gonna be me.
rachel_green Okay guys, way to wish me luck!
all@ Good luck! Go get 'em!
phoebe_buffay Okay, let's discuss Rachel's birthday. I say we throw a surprise party this weekend.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa, but her birthday isn't like for another month.
phoebe_buffay Yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.
monica_geller I think it's a great idea. Yeah, we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends.
joey_tribbiani Ross!! We're having a surprise party for Rachel!!
dr_ross_geller Okay!!
joey_tribbiani Done.
phoebe_buffay Okay, great so do you want to do it together?
monica_geller I would love to do it together!
joey_tribbiani They're gonna do it together.
chandler_bing Dude! That's my girlfriend!
joey_tribbiani What, so I gotta shut it down now?
dr_ross_geller All right, I gotta take off. I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition.
monica_geller It's gonna be weird to watch some actor pretending to be Ben's dad.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Weirder than watching his two moms make out?
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa dad? There's a dad in the commercial?
dr_ross_geller Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, hey, maybe I'll go down there with ya and see if I can get an audition to play the dad. I mean who better to play Ben's father than his godfather.
dr_ross_geller You're not his godfather.
joey_tribbiani What?! Are you kidding?!
dr_ross_geller Of course I am! Okay, let's go godfather.
joey_tribbiani All right!
joey_tribbiani Hey! I'm in, they're gonna let me audition!
dr_ross_geller Really? That's great!
joey_tribbiani I know! I know! It turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play, so I steered clear of her
carol_willick Hey, that kid looks familiar.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, yeah! He's done tons of commercials. I've seen him in like Sugar Smacks, Playstation, and that one for the phone company. In fact he was so good in that one, he actually convinced me to switch phone companies. Chandler was mad... .
dr_ross_geller Yeah well, he's not gonna get this one. Ben is way cuter than that kid. I mean look at him, look at you,
joey_tribbiani That's great. Listen, wouldn't it be great though if I got to play Ben's dad?
dr_ross_geller Joey, you look nothing like Ben.
joey_tribbiani I look more like him than you do!
carol_willick Y'know, I don't really know you well enough for you to do that.
kim_clozzi So it's down to these two, Nancy I know you like this one and I think I agree. Rachel, what do you think?
rachel_green Well umm, that one is pretty but uh, I just, I just love this fabric Sorry.
kim_clozzi Oh don't be sorry, that's part of your job here to give your opinions and then I take credit for them--I'm kidding.
nancy She is kidding, but don't ever disagree with her again. Okay, now I'm kidding!
rachel_green Oh, what a fun office.
kim_clozzi I don't know which one, but I do know I need a cigarette. So what do you say we take a break, we go outside, and we'll figure this out when we come back?
kim_clozzi Rachel? Do you smoke?
rachel_green Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories... ... about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke.
rachel_green and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me!
monica_geller That doesn't seem fair.
rachel_green I know! It's like I'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisoning habit!
chandler_bing Yeah, it is the best.
rachel_green I mean what if this keeps happening? Y'know, they'll-they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions and I'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air, y'know? And then when the day comes when Kim wants to promote one of us, who do you think she's gonna pick? Me or Smokey Smokerson?
monica_geller Rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke. Just say you wanna get some fresh air.
rachel_green Yeah, I can do that.
chandler_bing Yeah, or you can do the easy thing and smoke.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey Rach, you wanna get some coffee?
rachel_green I would love to!
phoebe_buffay Oh good!
chandler_bing Yeah, I wanna go to babe.
phoebe_buffay Oh good.
phoebe_buffay Oh wait, I change my mind! Okay, let's talk about the party! I have so many ideas!
monica_geller Yeah, me too!
phoebe_buffay Oh, look at that.
monica_geller All right, that's a little sketch of the cake, umm some sample menus, umm y'know what I thought we would start out with Tuscan style finger food, and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all my CDs! I've highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food.
phoebe_buffay What happened to the intimate dinner party?
monica_geller Oh, we're not doing that. Okay
phoebe_buffay So wow, it looks like you took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.
monica_geller What?! I didn't take care of everything, there's-there's plenty of things for you to do!
phoebe_buffay Like what?
monica_geller Cups.
phoebe_buffay Cups? You're giving me cups?
monica_geller And ice!
phoebe_buffay Cups and ice? Ooh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice? All right. Fine, okay, I will be in charge of cups and ice!
monica_geller Wait a minute, I can get ice at the restaurant
phoebe_buffay I got it! Mine!
dr_ross_geller Hi.
monica_geller Hey! How'd the audition go?!
dr_ross_geller Not so good.
monica_geller Wait a minute, are you doing Joey's "Audition didn't go so well. Yeah it did?"
dr_ross_geller Yeah I am! Yeah, Ben got a second audition!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback.
monica_geller You got a callback too didn't you?
joey_tribbiani Yeah I did!
kim_clozzi Hey Rachel, what are you doing out here?
rachel_green Oh well, it's kinda lonely up there, so I just thought I would come out here and get some fresh air.
kim_clozzi Nancy and I were talking about the fall collection.
rachel_green Oh great!
kim_clozzi So anyway we really... Honey, we're just smoking all over you.
nancy Oh, sorry!
rachel_green Oh that's okay.
kim_clozzi No-no-no, we'll move you just stay right there.
nancy So anyway I sent the designs over to Ralph and he's very excited about the line.
kim_clozzi Oh that's great! You are the best!
rachel_green Excuse me, can I, can I bum one of those? Y'know what, actually... Okay, okay, okay, what's so funny over here?
nancy I thought you didn't smoke.
rachel_green Oh, I thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes, y'know? Y'know what I mean, like dubbies? And I actually, I thought to myself, "Wow, those guys are crazy!" But no, I actually smoke the regular ones all, all the time.
kim_clozzi We get high.
rachel_green Oh, me too.
kim_clozzi I'm kidding.
rachel_green Oh, me too.
dr_ross_geller Oh God, this is so nerve wracking! How-how do you do this?
joey_tribbiani Well, unfortunately, I don't get many callbacks so
carol_willick Is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after the audition?
joey_tribbiani Who knows?
the_casting_director Okay uh, we have narrowed it down to Raymond, Ben, Kyle, and Joey. The rest of you, thank you very much.
dr_ross_geller Yes!! I knew it!! Bye-bye! So long! Later!
joey_tribbiani Oh this is great! I might actually get to play Ben's dad!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
the_casting_director Actually, that can't happen. Yeah because you all have such different looks, we're putting you with Raymond and Kyle with Ben. So it'll be either you two or you two.
joey_tribbiani Man, this is gonna be kinda weird.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, it is.
kyle Yeah. It's gonna be weird.
dr_ross_geller No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird.
kyle Oh, oh, I thought we were just talking.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
chandler_bing@dr_ross_geller Hi!
phoebe_buffay Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?
chandler_bing Ah sure. What's in 'em?
phoebe_buffay Umm, cups.
chandler_bing Oh good, because uh we got Rachel 800 gallons of water.
dr_ross_geller Seriously that's a lot of cups.
phoebe_buffay Yeah well, that's 'cause Monica put me in charge of cups and ice, and Monica is gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.
chandler_bing Y'know I rued the day once... didn't get a whole lot else done.
phoebe_buffay Okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups. Oh, hi Joey!
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs! Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Ross good, I'm uh glad you're here. I wanna talk to you about something.
dr_ross_geller What's up?
joey_tribbiani Well, I've been thinking about this whole commercial thing, y'know me going up against Ben, the two of us competing, and that can't lead to anything good. So, I think I'm just gonna step aside. I'm gonna tell them that I won't audition.
dr_ross_geller Wow, uh, Joey that's-that's great. Thanks man.
joey_tribbiani That's it? You're-you're gonna let me do this?! This-this is my career we're talking about here!
dr_ross_geller Well, you just
joey_tribbiani I just said that so you wouldn't let Ben do it! Look Ross, if anyone should step aside it should be Ben!
dr_ross_geller What?!
joey_tribbiani What? Chandler! Tell 'em!
chandler_bing Well I mean, let me get the door first. Oh, hi! No one.
dr_ross_geller Why should Ben step aside? It was his audition in the first place! You-you just tagged along! You're like the uh, tag-a-long dad.
joey_tribbiani At least I care about his feelings!
dr_ross_geller What?!
joey_tribbiani Do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?
dr_ross_geller And why wouldn't he get it?
joey_tribbiani Oh, come on! Have you seen what my kid can do?! Huh?! I mean he dials phones! He-he-he eats tortilla chips! He-he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger!
dr_ross_geller Are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?
joey_tribbiani You just give him a spoon baby!
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah? I guess we'll just see!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Because this commercial belongs to me and Mitch!
dr_ross_geller You're kid's name is Raymond!
joey_tribbiani Yeah?! So's yours!
monica_geller How did work go?
rachel_green Oh it was great! It was great! I went down there just like you said, y'know? And we talked business. Kim totally took my opinions.
monica_geller You stink!
rachel_green Thanks!
monica_geller No, I'm-I'm serious!
rachel_green Well-well that's 'cause I went down there and they were all smoking. This is actually the smell of success.
chandler_bing Okay, there's something different though--Oh my God! You smoked!
rachel_green I did not!
chandler_bing Yes you did! You look happy and sick; you smoked!
rachel_green All right, fine! But I had too! I had to do it for my career!
chandler_bing I wish I had smoked for my career
monica_geller That's so gross!
rachel_green No well, no it's not that bad, y'know? I mean yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and these fingers sort of smell, I actually feel like I can throw up.
chandler_bing Okay, but you gotta push past this because it is about to get so good!
monica_geller Chandler! I have to tell you, you smell so smokey I have to get up. I'm not kidding.
chandler_bing I think you smell great!
kim_clozzi So, we're decided, no on plaid, yes on pink?
nancy Absolutely!
rachel_green I am so on board!
kim_clozzi Rachel didn't you just light that?
rachel_green Yeah, I did, but y'know what? I am really, really trying to cut back, y'know? Good luck, Rach.
nancy I've actually been thinking about quitting lately.
kim_clozzi Oh sure, every Sunday night I'm telling myself I'm quitting but every Monday morning it's like
nancy Tell me about it!
rachel_green Well then let's just quit! We'll just quit! Let's all quit!
kim_clozzi It does sound appealing.
nancy Oh, I never could do it.
rachel_green Oh but you could. You can. Absolutely! We can help each other out! We can get--what are those--those patches! We could be like the Patch Sisters!
kim_clozzi Oh y'know, we really should quit. Okay, let's quit!
rachel_green Yes! Great! Give me those cigs! Give it! Give it!
kim_clozzi My late husband gave me that lighter. I'm not kidding.
rachel_green Okay then!
joey_tribbiani Hmmm, soup! Hmm soup! Hmm, soup!
carol_willick Joey, Ross is gonna be here any second, would you mind watching Ben for me while I use the ladies' room?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, no problem.
carol_willick Thanks.
joey_tribbiani Hi Ben! So you wanna be an actor huh? I gotta tell ya, it's no picnic. There's tons of rejection. No stability. One day you're Dr. Drake Remoray, the next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.
dr_ross_geller Joey!
joey_tribbiani Ross!
dr_ross_geller Ben! I mean, Ben! Ben!
the_casting_director Okay, Raymond, Joey you're up.

joey_tribbiani Well this is noodle soup and uh, I've been working with tomato. But that's okay, no problem. No problem. Hmm, noodle soup.
the_casting_director Y'know, that's-that's fine, but the line is, "Hmm, soup."
joey_tribbiani Oh, what did I say?
the_casting_director Hmm, noodle soup.
joey_tribbiani How's that different? Oh! Yeah!
the_casting_director All right, let's try one.
joey_tribbiani Hmm, noodle soup.
the_casting_director Okay. Let's do it again.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
joey_tribbiani Hmm, soup. I mean, noodle soup. I mean soup!

the_casting_director Y'know what? We need to move on.
joey_tribbiani No! No! I-I can do it one more time! See? Look! Hmm, noodle soup. Damnit!
rachel_green Hey! Hey-hey-hey!!
kim_clozzi Uh-oh, busted!
rachel_green Come on you guys! What are doing?! I thought we were the patch sisters!
kim_clozzi Yeah. That didn't work out.
nancy Rachel we tried to quit, but it was too hard!
rachel_green Well y'know if you, if you started smoking again you could've at least told me! Come on, give me one of those! What are we talking about?
kim_clozzi No. No! You're doing great! Don't you give up! That's why we didn't tell you and we're not gonna drag you down with us.
rachel_green Oh wait, no-no-no! Drag me down. Drag-drag me down.
kim_clozzi Forget it Rachel! We're both so proud of how well you're doing. I'm not gonna let you blow it. In fact, if I catch you with a cigarette, you're fired. So go on, get out of here! Go on, I don't want you breathing this stuff! Go on!
rachel_green Okay.
kim_clozzi So, okay! So you'll come with me on the Paris trip.
rachel_green Oh man!
phoebe_buffay Check it out! Cup hat! Cup banner! Cup chandelier! And the thing that started it all, the cup!
chandler_bing Great job with the cups, Pheebs!
monica_geller Why don't you just go out with her!
phoebe_buffay And did you notice the ice? Look! We have it all! We have crushed! Cubed! And dry! Watch! Ahhh! Mystical!
chandler_bing Awesome!
monica_geller Chandler! Everyone--no one's eating my Tuscan finger food 'cause they're all filling up on Phoebe's snow cones!
chandler_bing There are snow cones! Snow cones! Yuck!
monica_geller Y'know... go! Go! Right there!
chandler_bing Thank you! Thank you!
phoebe_buffay Oh, look! Look! Look!
all@ Surprise!!
rachel_green What?! What?! My birthday's not for another month!
monica_geller That's the surprise!
rachel_green Oh my God! You guys this is so great! I mean it's so unexpected! I mean Chandler's birthday is even before mine!
all@ Surprise!
rachel_green Wow! This is great! Look at all these cups! This is so weird.
phoebe_buffay I was in charge of cups.
rachel_green Oh, okay, not so weird.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller Listen man, uh, I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well.
joey_tribbiani Yeah right!
dr_ross_geller No really, I-I am! I feel bad!
joey_tribbiani Yeah? Well look Ross, you don't have to. Okay? It's not your fault I suck. I mean what kind of an actor can't even say, "Hmm, noodle soup."
dr_ross_geller Yeah y'know what? Maybe-maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck, maybe you messed up because you care more about uh, your godson.
joey_tribbiani What you do mean?
dr_ross_geller I think, sub-consciously
joey_tribbiani Wait-whoa-whoa, you lost me.
dr_ross_geller I think on some level, you-you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part.
joey_tribbiani Well, you're way sounds a lot better than mine. Yeah. Yeah! It's not that I'm a bad actor
dr_ross_geller No!
joey_tribbiani No, it's just ah, I care so damn much about little Ben that uh, it was more important to see him succeed.
dr_ross_geller There you go. Thank you!
joey_tribbiani Thank you! So, did-did he get it?
dr_ross_geller No.
joey_tribbiani Eh, what are you gonna do?
chandler_bing Oh, hi! Excuse me, is uh Rachel Green here? I was supposed to meet her for lunch.
kim_clozzi Oh, she doesn't come down here any more. You can find her up on ten.
chandler_bing Okay, great.
kim_clozzi So we talked about the whole presentation yesterday at lunch and he wondered if one person would be enough to get a take on the trip and I said, "Yeah, absolutely!"
chandler_bing I'll catch you guys later.
