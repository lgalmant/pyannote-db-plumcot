monica_geller Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
dr_ross_geller Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
rachel_green Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
chandler_bing We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
joey_tribbiani Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
dr_ross_geller Multiple orgasms!
chandler_bing So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
joey_tribbiani No plans, huh?
chandler_bing Not a one.
dr_ross_geller Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
chandler_bing Oh, right, right, shut up.
monica_geller Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
chandler_bing No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
joey_tribbiani Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
phoebe_buffay You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
chandler_bing Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
phoebe_buffay No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
dr_ross_geller Tony?
monica_geller Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
rachel_green Does anybody want anything else?
dr_ross_geller Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
phoebe_buffay What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
rachel_green It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
dr_ross_geller That guy, he burns me up.
rachel_green Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
chandler_bing Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
monica_geller Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?
rachel_green Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of "You'll never make it on your own".
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, uh-huh.
angela Hi, Joey.
joey_tribbiani My god, Angela.
monica_geller Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
phoebe_buffay Are you gonna go over there?
joey_tribbiani No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela.
angela Joey.
joey_tribbiani You look good.
angela That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
joey_tribbiani You don't say.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
rachel_green Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
rachel_green Who?
dr_ross_geller Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
rachel_green Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
dr_ross_geller Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
rachel_green Sure.
angela Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
joey_tribbiani Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
angela Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob...
joey_tribbiani Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
angela Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?
joey_tribbiani What?
angela We're just friends.
joey_tribbiani Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
angela What four of us?
joey_tribbiani You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
joey_tribbiani Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
monica_geller Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
joey_tribbiani Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
monica_geller Oh, god help us.
joey_tribbiani What?
monica_geller Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
joey_tribbiani Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
monica_geller What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
joey_tribbiani I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
dr_ross_geller Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
chandler_bing Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
dr_ross_geller It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
chandler_bing It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
dr_ross_geller Nuh-uh.
chandler_bing Yuh-huh.
dr_ross_geller So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
chandler_bing Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear-you want it to be dirty?
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
chandler_bing There you go.
monica_geller Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
joey_tribbiani Yep.
monica_geller Which?
joey_tribbiani Which what?
monica_geller You've never met Bob, have you?
joey_tribbiani No, but he's...
monica_geller Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
angela Hey, Joey.
monica_geller ..horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
chandler_bing Where are they? Where are they?
phoebe_buffay This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
chandler_bing It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
phoebe_buffay Eww, I don't wanna do that.
chandler_bing Here we go.
phoebe_buffay Ok, have a good break-up.
chandler_bing Hey, Janice.
janice Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.
chandler_bing Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
janice We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you...
chandler_bing What?
janice What?
chandler_bing What... did you get me there?
janice I got you...these.
chandler_bing Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
janice Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.
chandler_bing That's great.
chandler_bing Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
janice No, no, I'm still working on mine.
chandler_bing That's it?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it was really hard.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
phoebe_buffay Ok, you weren't there.
the_horrible_woman Comin' through. Move, move.
rachel_green Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
the_horrible_woman Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.
rachel_green But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
the_horrible_woman Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.
rachel_green What?
the_horrible_woman No suds, no save. Ok?
dr_ross_geller What's goin' on?
rachel_green Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
dr_ross_geller Was your basket on top?
rachel_green Yeah, but, there were no suds.
dr_ross_geller So?
rachel_green Well, you know, no suds, no save.
dr_ross_geller No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine.
the_horrible_woman Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.
dr_ross_geller Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
dr_ross_geller All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry.
rachel_green That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
dr_ross_geller Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
rachel_green What's that?
dr_ross_geller Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
dr_ross_geller Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
rachel_green Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
dr_ross_geller Rach, have you never done this before?
rachel_green Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
dr_ross_geller Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
rachel_green Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
dr_ross_geller Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
monica_geller He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up?
angela Brooklyn Heights.
bob Cleveland.
monica_geller How, how did that happen?
joey_tribbiani Oh my god.
monica_geller What?
joey_tribbiani I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
joey_tribbiani So, you and Angela, huh?
bob Yep. Pretty much.
joey_tribbiani You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
bob Huh, I never really noticed.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
bob Monica, Monica is great.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
monica_geller I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
angela Yeah, isn't he?
monica_geller It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
angela You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
monica_geller Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
angela Huh. That's nice.
phoebe_buffay Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
chandler_bing Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
janice All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it.
rachel_green Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
dr_ross_geller That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh.
rachel_green What uh-oh?
dr_ross_geller Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
rachel_green Ross, what's the matter?
dr_ross_geller Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
rachel_green Come on, show me.
dr_ross_geller All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
rachel_green Oh, everything's pink.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
rachel_green Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
monica_geller Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
monica_geller Oh my god.
joey_tribbiani What?
monica_geller Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
joey_tribbiani Come on, they're close.
monica_geller Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
joey_tribbiani Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
monica_geller Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's-not really true, is it?
joey_tribbiani Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
monica_geller Oh my god, what were you thinking?
joey_tribbiani All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
monica_geller Oh!
joey_tribbiani Ow!
monica_geller I'm outta here.
joey_tribbiani Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
monica_geller Really?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
monica_geller I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
joey_tribbiani Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
chandler_bing Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom,.. boom.
janice Ow!
chandler_bing Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
janice Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back.
chandler_bing I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god. How many of those have you had?
chandler_bing Oh, I don't know, a million?
phoebe_buffay Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
chandler_bing I'm fine.
phoebe_buffay All right.
chandler_bing I'm not fine. Here she comes.
phoebe_buffay Wait here. Breathe.
chandler_bing How do you do that?
phoebe_buffay It's like a gift.
chandler_bing We should always always break up together.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'd like that.
dr_ross_geller You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
rachel_green Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
rachel_green Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
the_horrible_woman Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way.
rachel_green I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
the_horrible_woman Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it.
rachel_green Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
the_horrible_woman Let go!
rachel_green All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
rachel_green Yes! Did you see that?
dr_ross_geller You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
rachel_green I could not have done this without you.
dr_ross_geller Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
rachel_green Are you sure?
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green Oh, are you sure you're ok?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Does it still hurt?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
monica_geller Hi.
phoebe_buffay Hey, how'd it go?
joey_tribbiani Excellent.
monica_geller We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
dr_ross_geller What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
monica_geller Oh, I'm sorry.
rachel_green Where's Chandler?
phoebe_buffay Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
chandler_bing I'm free! I'm free!
phoebe_buffay That oughta do it.
