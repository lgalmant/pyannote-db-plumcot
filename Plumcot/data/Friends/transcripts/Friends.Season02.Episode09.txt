phoebe_buffay Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?
chandler_bing Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.
monica_geller Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.
chandler_bing And twenty-five it is.
joey_tribbiani You gave him cookies?
monica_geller Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.
phoebe_buffay I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
chandler_bing Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?
phoebe_buffay Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them.
dr_ross_geller So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?
rachel_green Uhh, the mailman, the super.
monica_geller Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God.
rachel_green What?
joey_tribbiani Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.
rachel_green Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.
monica_geller Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.
chandler_bing Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh.
rachel_green Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
dr_ross_geller How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place?
gunther Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Here, go nuts.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani@monica_geller Hey.

dr_ross_geller OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh.
monica_geller Cute.
dr_ross_geller I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom.
monica_geller Ross, that is gorgeous!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
monica_geller Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
gang#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode09 Hey. Hi Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this?
dr_ross_geller Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.
phoebe_buffay This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.
chandler_bing Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.
phoebe_buffay No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.
rachel_green Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.
phoebe_buffay No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.
rachel_green How have you never been on Oprah?
phoebe_buffay OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.
monica_geller Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie.
phoebe_buffay It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother.
monica_geller Oh, wait a minute honey.
gang#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode09 Phoebs.
monica_geller Wow.
joey_tribbiani So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me.
gang#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode09 Joey!
joey_tribbiani Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!
frances Esther Livingston. Gone.
frances Hi, Phoe.
phoebe_buffay Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
frances Oh, just updating the phonebook.
phoebe_buffay Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?
frances Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?
phoebe_buffay Just, you know, to see... um.
frances Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. another graduation. another graduation.
phoebe_buffay OK, is this really my father?
frances Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
phoebe_buffay OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.
frances Look, I.
phoebe_buffay Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.
frances Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.
phoebe_buffay Oh God.
frances It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.
phoebe_buffay Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?
frances Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.
phoebe_buffay OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?
frances Honey.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
frances Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real him.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
chandler_bing Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.
rachel_green Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.
chandler_bing Who said anything about Christmas?
monica_geller Hi.
dr_ross_geller Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?
rachel_green No, nothin'.
monica_geller I hope she's OK.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.
monica_geller How do you know exactly what she's going through?
joey_tribbiani She told us.
chandler_bing So whaddya got there Monica?
monica_geller Just some stuff for the party.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?
monica_geller You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?
chandler_bing Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
rachel_green Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent.
monica_geller Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.
joey_tribbiani Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.
dr_ross_geller Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.
rachel_green Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of.
dr_ross_geller C'mon Rachel.
rachel_green OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.
dr_ross_geller See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.
rachel_green Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. OK, um, in Ithica. alright, um, Saratoga. Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information.
frances Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.
frances C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?
phoebe_buffay Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.
frances Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.
phoebe_buffay No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.
frances I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.
phoebe_buffay Whattaya mean?
frances He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.
phoebe_buffay Wow. Thank you.
frances Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa!
joey_tribbiani Phoebe here with the cab yet?
chandler_bing Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. hop in.
joey_tribbiani Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.
chandler_bing Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.
joey_tribbiani Hey, here she comes.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.
chandler_bing Eeeshk.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, big stuff.
phoebe_buffay OK, let's go.
chandler_bing OK.
phoebe_buffay Alright, here, you have to hold this.
chandler_bing OK. Brake left, gas right?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.
chandler_bing Where's my seat belt?
phoebe_buffay Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it.
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
dr_ross_geller C'mon, just tell me, please, please.
monica_geller For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.
rachel_green Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.
monica_geller Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please?
dr_ross_geller Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and.
monica_geller Ross, the heat!
dr_ross_geller Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is. off.
rachel_green Did you just break the radiator?
dr_ross_geller No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. here it is.
monica_geller Well put it back.
dr_ross_geller It uhh, it won't go back.
rachel_green I'll call the super.
monica_geller Here, let me try.
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.
monica_geller Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.
rachel_green Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes,
dr_ross_geller OK, tip the man.
monica_geller No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.
dr_ross_geller Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, this is it, 74.

monica_geller No, I will not cave.
rachel_green Yeah, I'm with Mon.

mr_treeger Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back.
dr_ross_geller No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?
mr_treeger No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.

dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Looks like he's playin' baseball.

monica_geller Whatever.
rachel_green What'cha gonna' do?
dr_ross_geller Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?

joey_tribbiani Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.
chandler_bing Well, so why not go knock?
phoebe_buffay Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.
joey_tribbiani Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
chandler_bing Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

chandler_bing Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.
joey_tribbiani Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.
chandler_bing Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!

monica_geller Honey, I'm sorry.
