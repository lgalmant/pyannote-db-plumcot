monica Hi!
chandler Hi!
joey Monica? What time is it?
chandler Uhh, 9.
joey But it's dark out.
monica Well that's because you always sleep to noon, silly! This is what 9 looks like.
joey I guess I'll get washed up then. Watch that sunrise.
monica I'm really getting tired of sneaking around.
chandler I know, me too. Hey! Y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend? Y'know we'd have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time.
monica All weekend? That's a whole lotta naked.
chandler Yeah, I can say that I have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
monica Ohh, I've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in Jersey!
chandler Okay, y'know your not though. Let's go.
monica Wait! What about Joey?
monica Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend! I'm going to this culinary fair in New Jersey.
phoebe Oh weird, Chandler just told us he's got a conference there!
monica Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.
chandler I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.
ross Hey.
joey Hey!
monica Hey.
ross Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
monica No, she's out shopping.
ross Damn!
chandler What's going on?
ross I told Emily to come. And I just need to y'know, talk to Rachel about it.
phoebe Wait a minute! So when Emily comes you're just, you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?
ross Well look, I'm just trying to focus on the "I get to see my wife," part, all right? And not the part that makes me do this.
monica Wow, so you guys are, you're never gonna be in the same room together? How is that even gonna work?
ross I have no idea. I mean... But-but I assure you I will figure it out.
joey Doesn't seem like it's going to work, I mean
rachel Hi, guys!
joey Hi!
chandler Uh, hey!
rachel What's going on?
chandler We're flipping Monica's mattress.
joey So I'm thinking, basically we pick it up and then we flip it.
phoebe Yeah that's better than my way.
rachel Oh okay, hey guys, would you flip mine too?
chandler Aww, man!
rachel Oh look! A letter from my mom.
ross So, Rach, y'know-y'know how Emily's coming right?
rachel Oh yeah! I know.
phoebe Can you hear anything?
chandler Oh yes, somebody just said, "Can you hear anything?"
monica Hey, Joey's ass! What are you doing?
joey Well, remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything? Well, when Ross said Rachel at the wedding, I figured it was gonna happen again, so I hid this in here.
monica Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles
phoebe Ooh, Madlibs, mine!
chandler Condoms?
joey You don't know how long we're gonna be in here! We may have to repopulate the Earth.
chandler And condoms are the way to do that?
ross Anyway it-it kinda-it all boils down to this, the last time I talked to Emily
rachel Oh my God! My dog died!
ross What?!
rachel Oh my God, Le Poo, our dog!
ross Le Poo's still alive?!
rachel Oh God, it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine--teen blocks. Oh. Oh my God.
monica Sweetie, we heard you crying. Please don't cry.
rachel It's Le Poo.
phoebe I know it's le poo right now, but it'll get better.
chandler I can't believe it! We're here!
monica Ooh, chocolates on the pillows! I love that!
chandler Oh, you should live with Joey, Roll-os everywhere.
monica Come here. Okay, be right back.
chandler Oh yes! Monica, get in here! There's a high-speed car chase on!
monica We're switching rooms.
chandler Oh dear God, they gave us glasses!
monica No, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them! I mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change. Come on sweetie, I just want this weekend to be perfect, I mean we can change rooms, can't we?
chandler Okay, but let's do it now though, because Chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
ross Hey, so uh, y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about?
rachel Oh yeah!
ross Well, y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily. Well, there's this one thing... Okay, here goes. I made a promise that--Oh hey!
rachel What?
ross You're nose is bleeding!
rachel Oh God. No! Oh not again! This-this happened when my grandfather died. It's ugh! Sorry. Oh, okay, so I'm sorry, what-what were you-what did you want to tell me?
ross Umm
rachel Sorry. Sorry.
ross Okay, I uh, I can't see you anymore.
rachel Yeah, I know. It's ridiculous! I can't see you either.
hotel_clerk I think you'll find this room more to your liking.
chandler Okay, great.
hotel_clerk They say he's only got half a tank left.
chandler Half a tank? We still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!
monica We're switching rooms again.
chandler What? Why?
monica This is a garden view room, and we paid for an ocean view room.
hotel_clerk Our last ocean view room was unacceptable to you.
monica Excuse me, umm, can I talk to you over here for just a second?
chandler Uh-huh.
monica Chandler!
chandler Yeah.
monica Look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride and I'm not gonna let 'em! And we're not a couple of suckers!
chandler I hear ya, Mugsy! But look, all these rooms are fine okay? Can you just pick one so I can watch--have a perfect, magical weekend together with you.
monica Okay, this one I like!
chandler Nothing! It's over! Dammit! This is regularly scheduled programming!
monica Can we turn the TV off? Okay? Do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
chandler Oh, I'm sorry, am I getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
monica Hey, don't blame me for wigging tonight!
chandler Oh, who should I blame? The nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
monica I don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from Albany to Canada on a half a tank of gas!
chandler Do not speak ill of the dead.
monica We're supposed to uh, be spending a romantic weekend together, it-it, what is the matter with you?
chandler I just want to watch a little television. What is the big deal? Geez, relax mom.
monica What did you say?
chandler I said, "Geez, relax Monnnnn."
rachel Hi!
ross Hey. Rachel, I-I-I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really, I just have to get it out.
rachel Okay, what's up?
ross Okay, y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
rachel Yeah, I told you to give Emily whatever she wants.
ross And while that was good advice, you should know that what-what she wants
rachel Yeah?
ross ...is for me not to see you anymore.
rachel That's crazy! You can't do that! What are you going to tell her? Oh God. Ohh, you already agreed to this, haven't you?
ross It's awful I know, I mean, I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work. And I do, I have to make this marriage work. I have too. But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here.
rachel Ohh! Lucky me! Oh my God! That is good news, Ross! I think that's the best news I've heard since Le Poo died!
ross You have no idea what a nightmare this has been. This is so hard.
rachel Oh yeah, really? Is it Ross? Yeah? Okay, well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you.
ross What are you doing?
rachel Storming out!
ross Rachel, this is your apartment.
rachel Yeah, well that's how mad I am!!
chandler Damn Rollos!
joey Hey, you're back!
chandler Hey.
joey How was your conference?
chandler It was terrible. I fought with my colleagues y'know, the entire time. Are you kidding with this?
joey Oh, so your weekend was a total bust?
chandler Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump waiting for an elevator.
monica Hi!
joey Hey, you're back too!
monica Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?
joey Hey, how was your chef thing?
monica Oh, it was awful. I guess some people just don't appreciate really good food.
chandler Well, maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea.
monica Chandler!
chandler Monica.
monica Okay, I'd like to know how much the room was because I'd like to pay my half.
chandler Okay, fine, $300.
monica 300 dollars?!
chandler Yeah, just think of it as $25 per room!
monica Urghh!!
joey What are you guys woofing about?
monica Chandler stole a twenty from my purse!
joey Nooooo!!! Y'know what? Now that I think about it, I constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots!
ross You should've seen the look on her face. I don't want Rachel to hate me! I don't know what to do.
joey You want my advice?
ross Yes! Please!
joey You're not gonna like it.
ross That's okay.
joey You got married to fast.
ross That's not advice!
joey I told ya.
ross I'm going to the bathroom.
joey Man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, I couldn't do it.
chandler_and_phoebe Yeah, me either.
monica Maybe I could do it.
rachel Hi!
joey Hi, Rach.
chandler Hi!
phoebe Hey.
monica Hey.
rachel Look, I know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and Ross but y'know, I've been obsessing about it all day and I'd just love not to talk about it. All right?
joey I-I-I don't know if this falls under this category, but uh, Ross is right back there.
rachel That's not Ross!
phoebe Oh no! Not that guy! He does look like him though.
chandler Okay, Ross is in the bathroom.
rachel Oh my God, its happening. It's already started. I'm Kip.
joey Hey, you're not Kip!
rachel Do you even know who Kip is?
joey Who cares? You're Rachel! Who's Kip?
chandler Kip, my old roommate, y'know we all used to hang out together.
joey Oh, that poor bastard.
rachel See? Yeah, you told me the story. He and Monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened? He got phased out!
monica You're not gonna be phased out!
rachel Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.
phoebe Ehh!!
rachel Honey, come on! You live far away! You're not related. You lift right out.
chandler Hey!
joey Hey, Mr. Bing. That uh, hotel you stayed at called. Said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.
chandler Yes that was mine.
joey 'Cause I figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there.
chandler Yes that would have made more sense.
joey Y'know, I-I don't even feel like I know you anymore man! All right, look, I'm just gonna ask you this one time. And whatever you say, I'll believe ya. Were you, or were you not on a gay cruise?!
rachel Phoebe? I'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing. You gotta come with me!
phoebe Come where?
rachel Wherever I go. Come on you and me, we'll-we'll start a new group, we're the best ones.
phoebe Okay, but try and get Joey too.
ross Pheebs, you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?
phoebe Oh, sure! Bye Ross! Forever.
ross Hi.
rachel Hi. What are you doing here? Isn't this against the rules?
ross I talked to Monica, look, I'm the one who made the choice. I'm the one who's making things change, so I should be the one to y'know, step back.
rachel Oh, Ross
ross No, no, it's okay. Really. They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King. So is, is that better?
rachel No, it's not better. I still don't get to see you.
ross Well, what-what would you do? Rach, if you were me, what-what would you do?
rachel Well, for starters I would've said the right name at my wedding!
ross I can't believe this is happening.
rachel I know.
ross I am so sorry.
rachel I know that too.
joey Hey, Rach? Sorry to interrupt but umm, Phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something.
chandler Hey!
monica Hi.
chandler I just came over to drop off...nothing. So that weekend kinda sucked, huh?
monica Yeah, it did.
chandler So, I guess this is over.
monica What?
chandler Well, y'know, you and me, it had to end sometime.
monica Why, exactly?
chandler Because of the weekend, we had a fight.
monica Chandler that's crazy! If you give up every time you'd have a fight with someone you'd never be with anyone longer than-Ohhh!
chandler So, this isn't over?
monica You are so cute! No. No, it was a fight. You deal with it and move on! It's nothing to freak out about.
chandler Really? Okay. Great!
monica Ohh, welcome to an adult relationship!
chandler We're in a relationship?
monica I'm afraid so.
chandler Okay.
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Oh hey, Monica, I heard you saw Donald Trump at your convention.
monica Yeah, I saw him waiting for an elevator.
monica Hey, Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler, I think I lost mine.
rachel Yeah, it's in there.
joey Oh! Ohh! Oh!!
chandler Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
joey Oohh!! Ohh! Oh-oh-oh! Oh-oh!!
joey Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
chandler Yes. Yes.
joey You?! And-and you?!
monica Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
joey How?! When?!
chandler It happened in London.
joey IN LONDON!!!
chandler The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
joey But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
chandler No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
monica Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
joey All right! Man, this is unbelievable! I mean, it's great, but
monica I know, it's great!
joey Aww, I don't want to see that!
phoebe We're so stupid! Do you know what's going on in there? They're trying to take Joey!
phoebe The most popular Phoebe in tennis is called the overhand Phoebe. And if you win, you must slap your opponent on the Phoebe and say, "Hi, Phoebe!"
monica Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.
phoebe Count for what?
monica Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.
joey I guess I'm done.
chandler Fun's over!
monica Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!
rachel Uh-huh!
joey I think I'm gonna take-off.
monica Guys, rules are good! Rules help control the fun! Ohhh!
