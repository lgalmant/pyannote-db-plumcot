phoebe Okay!
monica Come on, no peeking!
chandler Our eyes are closed and we're about to cross the street. Very good.
phoebe Okayyyyy, open up!
ross What did you want to show us? Because all I can see is this bitchin' van!
phoebe Yeah, it's for our catering business!
joey I think I know that girl.
monica All right, umm, we're not gonna really keep it this way though.
rachel No?
phoebe No, we're gonna paint over the sword, and replace it with a baguette.
rachel Oh!
phoebe And also, we don't know what to do with this.
joey Oh yeah, I definitely know her.
monica Remember that guy from cooking school I told you about that put cilantro with everything?
phoebe Oh sure, Cilantro Larry.
monica Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the Chelsea Reporter.
monica Wow, Monica! What an amazing opportunity to influence... dozens of people.
phoebe How could you say yes, what about our catering business?
monica Oh no-no-no, it's only one night a week, and plus I get to take all of you out for a lot of free dinners.
all Yay!!
phoebe Oh, in that case - - Yay! That was me hopping on board.
monica Oh.
chandler Hey, you guys! Hey, Ross, quick question for ya. Are you ready to party?
ross I don't know, I could maybe go out for a couple of beers, but there's this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch.
chandler No-no, I don't think you heard me. Are you ready to party?!
ross Nooo!! Gandolf?! Gandolf is coming to town?
chandler Kathy's with her parents, I have nothing to do, so tomorrow we are partying with Gandolf dude!
ross Dude, we are sooo gonna party!
phoebe Wow! Okay, dude alert! And who is this guy?
ross Mike "Gandolf" Ganderson, only like the funest guy in the world.
chandler I'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow!
ross I'm gonna call after you!
chandler This is gonna be soo cool, dude, we never party anymore!
chandler_and_ross Woooo!!!
monica All right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?
joey Really. And what do you mean you never have fun anymore? You have fun with me, remember that time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?
ross Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!
joey Well, why do you call him Gandolf?
ross Gandolf the wizard. Hello! Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?
joey No, I had sex in high school.
rachel Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. There's an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Miss
joanna Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.
rachel Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day and
joanna Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you can't stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.
rachel God, I am so glad you don't have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldn't even consider applying.
joanna Really? Well, in that case
rachel And that's I'm so glad... there's no problem.
joanna That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face.
rachel Ohh! That's great!
joanna You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.
rachel Really?!
joanna No-ho-ho! Yeah. I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.
rachel Well, I, umm
joanna Kidding! God, I feel wild today!
chandler Oh man! I am so excited - I may vomit!
joey Will you calm down, he's just a human guy.
chandler Look you don't understand, Gandolf is amazing. Y'know you're never know what's gonna end up happening, you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia!
joey Really?!
chandler Oh yeah, it's beautiful country up there.
ross Hey! Okay! I got my passport, fresh socks, and a snake bite kit!
chandler It's not gonna be exactly like last time.
joey All right, I'll see you guys.
chandler_and_ross Whoa-whoa-whoa!
chandler Whoa-wh-wh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
joey I have an audition, but I'll definitely hook up with you later. Where are you gonna be around noon?
ross Somewhere maybe along the equator?
joey Okay.
chandler Hello. It's Gandolf!!! So, are you in town? Oh, well, well maybe next time then.
ross What happened?
chandler He's not gonna make it, he's stuck in Chicago.
ross Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!
chandler Stupid, useless Canadian money!
mr_posner You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.
rachel Thank you.
joanna Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
rachel Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.
mrs_lynch I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.
rachel Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.
joanna Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost every time!
rachel I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.
joanna Oh yes, well there's the coffee too. Rachel can carry two things at once!
mr_posner Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.
rachel Yes, I realize that
joanna And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.
rachel I love working with designers!
joanna With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?
monica Hey! My first review is out!
phoebe Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.
monica All right, look at my on the back page.
phoebe Oh, okay! "Would I go back to Allesandro's? Sure, but I'd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." Wow! You really laid into this place.
monica Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.
phoebe Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.
monica Oh! Do you need me to go with you?
phoebe No-no, it's okay. But are we sure we don't want the waterbed?
monica Haven't we made this decision?
phoebe Yeah, all right.
monica Bye!
phoebe Bye!
monica Who is it?
allesandro It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.
monica Oh my God.
allesandro I want to talk to you about your review.
monica Oh my God, oh my God. Call me on the phone!
allesandro Why? So you could hang up on me?
monica Look, I-I'm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.
allesandro Just give me a chance too
phoebe Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.
monica No! Phoebe!
phoebe Hey, Monica!
allesandro I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!
monica I couldn't eat it! I had five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.
allesandro Well our service is not grossly incompetent.
monica The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!
allesandro Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!
monica All right, that I'll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasn't it. You're marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.
allesandro Hey! I'm proud of that sauce, it's delicious.
monica Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?
allesandro Lebanon.
monica Hand me those tomatoes, I'm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.
allesandro How long is this gonna take? 'Cause I got another critic to go yell at.
rachel Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.
joanna I thought it went very well.
rachel No! It didn't! That's what I want to talk to you about. Now, just to brief you... I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.
joanna Rachel, please, don't make a scene.
rachel There's nobody here!
joanna Sophie, get in here! You see! Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable!
sophie She's not making me uncomfortable.
joanna Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out.
rachel Do you want me to quit?
joanna What?! What would make you think that?
rachel Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Y'know what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, and I will be gone by the end of the day! Well, I guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
joanna Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant.
rachel What?
joanna That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking
rachel My drinking?
joanna Oh, I must've said that after you left.
rachel Said what? Exactly.
joanna That you enjoyed the occasional drink... ing binge.
rachel Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! I'm leaving! You are just a horrible person!
joanna Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If you're gonna get all sensitive about it! I don't want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? I'll make you an assistant buyer in this department.
rachel Say more things like that.
joanna You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.
rachel I'd need an expense account.
joanna Done!
rachel And an assistant.
joanna Sophie, get in here!
joey Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.
ross It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.
joey So you've been sittin' around here all mornin'?
ross No! I balanced my checkbook.
chandler Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.
ross I can't believe he didn't come!
joey So what if he didn't come! We can still go out and party ourselves!
chandler Oh-no, y'know with Gandolf we'd be out all night!
ross Yeah! We'd meet, we'd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!
joey Well, we could do that!
ross There's other stuff too.
joey We'll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!
ross Yeah!
joey Yeah!
ross Yeah!!
joey Yeah!!
ross It's not like we don't know how to party!!
joey Yeah! All right? Let's go!
chandler And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?
joey_and_ross Yeah!!!
chandler All right!!
ross Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?
chandler Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?
ross Yeah.
chandler Well, those were seals, man.
rachel Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
monica Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!
rachel Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!
monica Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!
rachel Ohh, you've waited soo long.
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.
phoebe Yeah.
rachel How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?
phoebe I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!
rachel Yes!!!
monica You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?
rachel Ohh, it's gonna be so great! I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell, I'm gonna have an office with walls and everything. I'm gonna have walls!
phoebe Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.
monica Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.
phoebe But we've only had one job.
monica I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?
phoebe Yeah! What are you saying?
monica I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.
phoebe What?
monica It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.
phoebe You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!
monica All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.
phoebe For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.
monica Phoebe, wait a minute!
rachel I'm an assistant buyer!!
joey All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.
chandler Yeah, all right.
ross Okay.
joey So, we're having fun, right?
chandler_and_ross Yeah.
joey We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.
ross I'm kinda beat.
chandler Actually, me too.
joey Are you serious?!
chandler_and_ross Yeah.
joey Thank God! I'm exhausted!
gunther So you guys want coffees?
joey Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.
ross Yeah, me too.
chandler Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?
joey I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
ross I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.
ross How sad are we?
joey Yeah, I know.
chandler Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!
joey_and_ross Yeah!
joey Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.
chandler_and_ross Yeah!
ross And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!
joey We're 29, we're not women.
monica Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.
phoebe Okay, I'm hearing.
monica I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.
phoebe What?!
monica Or! A bakery delivery person.
phoebe I wa-I wa-I wa
monica Pizza?!
phoebe Monica!
monica All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver.
phoebe No.
monica Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either.
phoebe No.
monica Y'know what, let's do the catering business.
phoebe Really?! Are you sure?
monica Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun.
phoebe Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job.
monica Really?!
phoebe Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.
monica Thank you.
phoebe Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.
rachel Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?
mrs_lynch Oh my goodness! You haven't heard!
rachel Heard what?
mrs_lynch Joanna passed away last night.
rachel Oh my God! How?!
mrs_lynch Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.
rachel Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!
mrs_lynch I know!
rachel Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.
mrs_lynch I didn't realize that she was so close.
rachel Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
mrs_lynch No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
rachel Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us - nothing about an assistant buyer?
mrs_lynch No, I'm sorry. I have to go.
sophie Good morning!
rachel Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna
sophie I sure did!
allesandro I'm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, it's like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much we're gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.
monica Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?
