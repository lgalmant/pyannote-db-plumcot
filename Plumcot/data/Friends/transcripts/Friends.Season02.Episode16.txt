joey_tribbiani Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
chandler_bing That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a
chandler_bing Waaa-aaah.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, so.
chandler_bing Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
joey_tribbiani Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
chandler_bing Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
joey_tribbiani Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
chandler_bing Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
joey_tribbiani Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller@phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
joey_tribbiani Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
phoebe_buffay Ahh.
rachel_green OK, ready when you are.
phoebe_buffay Okey-doke.
monica_geller I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
chandler_bing Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
rachel_green Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
joey_tribbiani Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
phoebe_buffay Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
chandler_bing Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
joey_tribbiani So where you gettin' it?
phoebe_buffay I think on my shoulder.
dr_ross_geller What? What's on your shoulder?
phoebe_buffay Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
dr_ross_geller A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
rachel_green Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
dr_ross_geller No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
monica_geller Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
chandler_bing Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
monica_geller Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
joey_tribbiani Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
monica_geller Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
phoebe_buffay No, I think you should tell them.
monica_geller No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
dr_ross_geller I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
dr_ross_geller Alright, shall we?
monica_geller OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
dr_ross_geller Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
judy_geller Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
monica_geller Happy birthday dad.
jack_geller Oh thank you.
dr_ross_geller Hi ma.
dr_richard_burke Happy birthday.
judy_geller Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
dr_ross_geller Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
friend#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Well, you kids take the train in?
judy_geller No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
friend#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
monica_geller Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
judy_geller Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
monica_geller Are we still on that?
judy_geller We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
friend#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
joey_tribbiani Can you believe this place?
chandler_bing I know, this is a great apartment.
joey_tribbiani Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
chandler_bing Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Thanks. You want it?
joey_tribbiani Huh?
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
joeys_costar#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
chandler_bing Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
jack_geller C'mon, tell us.
friend#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode16 Yeah, is she really 20.
dr_richard_burke I am not telling you guys anything.
jack_geller C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
dr_ross_geller Dad, you really don't want to do that.
jack_geller Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
dr_richard_burke Jack, would you let it go?
jack_geller Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
dr_richard_burke Guys. Seriously, it is
jack_geller Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . .
dr_ross_geller Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
jack_geller What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
phoebe_buffay OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
rachel_green Well I. . .
phoebe_buffay I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
tattoo_artist Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
phoebe_buffay Here we go.
rachel_green Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay You're not going?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
rachel_green No. Well, yeah, maybe.
phoebe_buffay I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
rachel_green What's 1922?
phoebe_buffay Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
rachel_green Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . .
phoebe_buffay OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
rachel_green No.
phoebe_buffay OK, who is the boss of you?!!
rachel_green You?
phoebe_buffay No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip.
dr_richard_burke How ya doin'?
monica_geller I'm a twinkie.
dr_richard_burke Really? I'm a hero.
monica_geller Oh, this is so hard.
dr_richard_burke Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
monica_geller Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
dr_richard_burke My parents are dead.
monica_geller God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean.
dr_richard_burke I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
monica_geller Alright.
dr_richard_burke Judy,
judy_geller Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
jack_geller Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
judy_geller I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
jack_geller I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from
judy_geller I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
jack_geller Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
judy_geller Really.
jack_geller I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
judy_geller So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
jack_geller Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
judy_geller Oh Jack stop.
jack_geller C'mon, it's my birthday.
joey_tribbiani Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
chandler_bing Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
joey_tribbiani Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
chandler_bing Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
joey_tribbiani Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
chandler_bing Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
joey_tribbiani What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
chandler_bing Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
joey_tribbiani Well that's how I feel.
chandler_bing Well then maybe you should take it.
joey_tribbiani Well then maybe I will.
chandler_bing Fine with me.
joey_tribbiani Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
jack_geller Who's drink can I freshen?
judy_geller Almost time for cake.
dr_ross_geller Mon, Mon, are you OK?
monica_geller You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Well, I just caught the live show.
dr_ross_geller Eww.
monica_geller Hey there.
dr_richard_burke What?
monica_geller Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
dr_richard_burke Humm, really?
judy_geller Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
dr_richard_burke Uhh, not that I know of.
judy_geller Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
dr_richard_burke That - that's an idea.
monica_geller Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
judy_geller Oh?
dr_richard_burke Oh?
dr_ross_geller Ohh.
judy_geller She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
dr_ross_geller Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
judy_geller So, who's the mystery man?
monica_geller Well, uh, he's a doctor.
judy_geller A real doctor?
monica_geller No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
judy_geller Well that's wonderful. . . I
monica_geller Mom, it's OK.
dr_richard_burke It is Judy.
judy_geller Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
jack_geller Found it.
dr_ross_geller I'll take that dad.
judy_geller It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
jack_geller That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
monica_geller Dad, I'm the twinkie.
jack_geller You're the twinkie?
dr_richard_burke She's not a twinkie.
monica_geller Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .
judy_geller Oh please, a relationship.
monica_geller Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
dr_richard_burke Really?
monica_geller Yes.
jack_geller Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
monica_geller Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
jack_geller When did I say that?
monica_geller Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
phoebe_buffay Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
rachel_green I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
phoebe_buffay Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.
rachel_green Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours.
phoebe_buffay Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
rachel_green You didn't get it?
phoebe_buffay No.
rachel_green Why didn't you get it?
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
rachel_green Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
phoebe_buffay I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
rachel_green Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . .
chandler_bing Yeah me too.
joey_tribbiani I know. Yeah.
chandler_bing Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
joey_tribbiani No, we're alright.
chandler_bing So I got ya something.
joey_tribbiani Plastic spoons. Great.
chandler_bing Lick away my man.
joey_tribbiani These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
chandler_bing No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
joey_tribbiani I'm movin' out like we talked about.
chandler_bing Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
joey_tribbiani Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever.
chandler_bing Well, there you go.
joey_tribbiani Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
chandler_bing Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
joey_tribbiani Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
chandler_bing I did pay for half of it.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
chandler_bing Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
joey_tribbiani Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
chandler_bing Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
joey_tribbiani Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
monica_geller So, are you sorry that I told them?
dr_richard_burke No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.
rachel_green Oh.
monica_geller Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
rachel_green Is Ross here?
monica_geller No he went out to get pizza.
rachel_green Oh really, OK.
monica_geller That's great.
dr_richard_burke Very tasteful.
phoebe_buffay Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?
monica_geller Yes.
rachel_green What? You didn't get one.
phoebe_buffay OK, well then what is this?
dr_richard_burke What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
phoebe_buffay OK, that's my tattoo.
rachel_green That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
phoebe_buffay OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
rachel_green Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
dr_ross_geller You got a tattoo?
rachel_green Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
dr_ross_geller Lemme see.
rachel_green Well?
dr_ross_geller Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?
rachel_green I guess.
dr_ross_geller Hey, save us some pizza.
joey_tribbiani Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it.
chandler_bing Stop talkin' to your men.
joey_tribbiani Yes! And the table is mine.
chandler_bing Congratulations.
joey_tribbiani Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . . except when we are here.
phoebe_buffay I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
monica_geller I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore.
rachel_green Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
joey_tribbiani Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
chandler_bing Yeah, I remember.
dr_ross_geller Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
chandler_bing So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
joey_tribbiani Naa, you keep it, you need the practice.
chandler_bing Thanks.
joey_tribbiani So, I guess this is it.
chandler_bing Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so.
