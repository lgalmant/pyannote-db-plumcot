phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Any sign of your brother?
phoebe_buffay No, but he's always late.
rachel_green I thought you only met him once?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I did. I think it sounds y'know big sistery, y'know, 'Frank's always late.'
rachel_green Well relax, he'll be here.
phoebe_buffay No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.
rachel_green Well, actually Gunther sent me. You're not allowed to have cups out here, it's a thing.
chandler_bing Does anyone else think David Copperfield is cute?

monica_geller So, Chandler, who's on your list?
chandler_bing Ah, Kim Basinger, Cindy Crawford, Halle Berry, Yasmine Bleeth, and ah, Jessica Rabbit.
rachel_green Now, you do realize that she's a cartoon, and way out of your league?
chandler_bing I know, I know, I just always wondered if I could get her eyes to pop out of her head.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Monica, who would yours be?
monica_geller First, I need a boyfriend, then I can have a list.
joey_tribbiani It's just a game Mon. Rach, how about you?

dr_ross_geller Spiderman?
rachel_green Hardy Boy.
chandler_bing Peter Parker.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
rachel_green What about you honey, who would be on your list?

chandler_bing You know, we don't really take advantage of living in the city.
joey_tribbiani I know.

monica_geller I can't live like this! What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?
joey_tribbiani Relax. Here hold this . This old stuff just comes right off.
monica_geller That's a little more than I wanted to see.
joey_tribbiani Aw! Look at that, every inch of this stuff is glued down. It'd take forever to pry this up. You should ah, you should just leave it.
monica_geller I can't leave it! You gouged a hole in my dingy floor.
joey_tribbiani Eh! There you go.
monica_geller You know that's nice, y'know we could put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon!
phoebe_buffay Oh, ew!
frank_buffay_jr What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you. Um, can you roll your tongue? Because I can, and my Mom couldn't, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.
frank_buffay_jr What, wait, you mean like this?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.
frank_buffay_jr Your not doing it.
phoebe_buffay Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can't. We don't have that....

chandler_bing All right, so who do you got it narrowed down to?
dr_ross_geller Okay, Elizabeth Hurely....
chandler_bing Oooh-hoo, very attractive, forgiving.
dr_ross_geller Susan Sarandon.
chandler_bing Eh, y'know what, she's to political, she probably wouldn't let you do it, unless you donated four cans of food first.
dr_ross_geller And!! Isabella Rosselini.
chandler_bing Ooh-hoo. Very hot, very sexy. But ah, y'know she's too international, y'know she's never gonna be around.
rachel_green So?
chandler_bing So, you gotta play the odds, pick somebody who's gonna be in the country like all the time.
rachel_green Yeah, 'cause that's why you won't get Isabella Rosselini, geography.
phoebe_buffay Okay so, by melting, you meant melting.

monica_geller Oh honey, we're close now but you-you wouldn't believe the years of-of nugies, and wedgies, and flying wedgies, and atomic wedgies, and.... That's where the waistband actually goes over your head.
phoebe_buffay Ah!!

phoebe_buffay Which you just gave up really quickly.
chandler_bing Have you seen Joey?
monica_geller What's the matter?

chandler_bing Okay, on three. One....Two....
joey_tribbiani Why don't we just go on two.

joey_tribbiani Because it's faster.
chandler_bing Yeah, I coulda counted to three like four times without all this 'two' talk.
rachel_green Oh!
joey_tribbiani All right, but in the future...
dr_ross_geller Okay!! Okay!!
rachel_green Come on!

chandler_bing Oh, good job Joe.
joey_tribbiani Wow, it's big!
chandler_bing Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
joey_tribbiani Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
phoebe_buffay Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
joey_tribbiani Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
chandler_bing Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
rachel_green Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
isabella_rossellini Um, coffee to go, please.
dr_ross_geller Isabella Rosselini.
monica_geller Are you serious? Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
monica_geller Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, maybe.
rachel_green Oh-oh, you lie.
dr_ross_geller What you don't think I'd go up to her?
rachel_green Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
rachel_green You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
dr_ross_geller Okay, hold my crawler.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
rachel_green Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
dr_ross_geller Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
isabella_rossellini Aren't you with that girl over there?
dr_ross_geller Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
isabella_rossellini I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
isabella_rossellini Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
dr_ross_geller Um, yeah.
isabella_rossellini May I see it?
dr_ross_geller Um, no.
isabella_rossellini Come on!
dr_ross_geller But, okay.
isabella_rossellini I'm not on the list!
dr_ross_geller Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
isabella_rossellini It's laminated!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
isabella_rossellini Y'know it's ironic...
dr_ross_geller What?
isabella_rossellini ...because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
dr_ross_geller We're just gonna be friends.
joey_tribbiani Y'know what?
chandler_bing Umm?
joey_tribbiani I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
chandler_bing I've got five bucks says you can't.
