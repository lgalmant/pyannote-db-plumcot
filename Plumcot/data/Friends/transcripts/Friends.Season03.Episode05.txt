rachel_green Well relax, he'll be here.
phoebe_buffay No, I know, I'm just nervous. Y'know it's just y'know Mom's dead, don't talk to my sister, Grandma's been sleeping a lot lately. It's like the last desperate chance to have a family, y'know, kinda thing. You're so sweet to wait with me.

chandler_bing Oh, good job Joe.
joey_tribbiani Wow, it's big!
chandler_bing Yeah-yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller!
joey_tribbiani Maybe, my ruler's wrong.
phoebe_buffay Maybe all the rulers are wrong.
joey_tribbiani Look it's not that bad. So what, it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.
chandler_bing Yeah, y'know what I got a better idea. How-how 'bout it blocks none of mine door and a lot of yours?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, listen, before I forget that side is still wet.
rachel_green Okay sir, um-mm, let see if I got this right. Ah, so this is a half-caf, double tall, easy hazel nut, non-fat, no foam, with whip, extra hot latte, right? Okay, great. You freak.
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
isabella_rossellini Um, coffee to go, please.
dr_ross_geller Isabella Rosselini.
monica_geller Are you serious? Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller Damn! I can't believe I took her off my list.
monica_geller Why? 'Cause otherwise you'd go for it?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, maybe.
rachel_green Oh-oh, you lie.
dr_ross_geller What you don't think I'd go up to her?
rachel_green Ross, it took you ten years to finally admit you liked me.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well missy, you better be glad that list is laminated.
rachel_green You know what honey, you go ahead, we'll call her an alternate.
dr_ross_geller Okay, hold my crawler.
rachel_green Okay.
monica_geller Rach, are you really gonna let him do this?
rachel_green Honey, he's about to go hit on Isabella Rosselini. I'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.
dr_ross_geller Hi! Hi, I'm Ross, you don't know me, but I'm a big, big fan of yours. I mean, Blue Velvet, woo-oo hoo! Um, I was wondering if I could um, maybe buy you a cup of coffee? Or maybe reimburse you for that one?
isabella_rossellini Aren't you with that girl over there?
dr_ross_geller Well, yeah, kinda. Um, but that's okay, see we have an understanding, um, see we each have this list of five famous people, so I'm allowed to sleep with you. No, no, no, it's flattery.
isabella_rossellini I'm sorry.
dr_ross_geller Oh no, no, no, wait, wait, Isabella. Don't, don't just dismiss this so fast. I mean this is a once in a lifetime opportunity...
isabella_rossellini Yeah, for you. Is that the list?
dr_ross_geller Um, yeah.
isabella_rossellini May I see it?
dr_ross_geller Um, no.
isabella_rossellini Come on!
dr_ross_geller But, okay.
isabella_rossellini I'm not on the list!
dr_ross_geller Um, see, but that's not the final draft.
isabella_rossellini It's laminated!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, um, okay see, you were, you were on the list but my friend, Chandler brought up the very good point that you are international, so I bumped you for Wynona Rider, local.
isabella_rossellini Y'know it's ironic...
dr_ross_geller What?
isabella_rossellini ..because I have a list of five goofy coffee house guys and yesterday I bumped you for that guy over there.
dr_ross_geller We're just gonna be friends.
joey_tribbiani Y'know what?
chandler_bing Umm?
joey_tribbiani I bet 'ya ya I could fit in there.
chandler_bing I've got five bucks says you can't.
