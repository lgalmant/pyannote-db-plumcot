monica_geller Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.
phoebe_buffay Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?
susan_bunch Oh, is he hungry already?
carol_willick I guess so.
chandler_bing You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.
joey_tribbiani I gotta get one, too.
dr_ross_geller What are you guys doing?
chandler_bing We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
dr_ross_geller Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it.
dr_ross_geller This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.
dr_ross_geller Carol?
chandler_bing Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?
carol_willick Sure.
joey_tribbiani Uh, does it hurt?
carol_willick It did at first, but not anymore.
joey_tribbiani Chandler?
chandler_bing So, uh, how often can you do it?
carol_willick As much as he needs.
joey_tribbiani Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?
julie Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
rachel_green Yeah, I forget which ones.
julie Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
all@ No thanks.
julie Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
rachel_green Thank you. What a bitch.
julie Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
phoebe_buffay I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
monica_geller Ok, um, I'll go with you.
julie Great.
dr_ross_geller Hi, honey.
chandler_bing Hey, sweetums.
dr_ross_geller Hello to the rest.
all@ Hi!
joey_tribbiani Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
monica_geller It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
chandler_bing Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
monica_geller But I'm...
phoebe_buffay Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
monica_geller Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
dr_ross_geller It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
monica_geller You're welcome.
phoebe_buffay Woof, woof.
joey_tribbiani Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
annabel Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?
joey_tribbiani Who?
annabel Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
the_hombre_man Hombre?
joey_tribbiani What's he doin' in my section?
annabel I guess he doesn't know.
joey_tribbiani Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?
the_hombre_man Mornin'.
joey_tribbiani Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.
the_hombre_man Your territory, huh?
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Bijan for men?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode02 No thanks.
the_hombre_man Hombre?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode02 Yeah. All right.
the_hombre_man You were saying?
monica_geller Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.
phoebe_buffay What?
monica_geller We were shopping, and we had lunch.
phoebe_buffay Oh, all right. What did I have?
monica_geller You had a salad.
phoebe_buffay Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.
rachel_green Hey, guys, what's up.
phoebe_buffay I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.
rachel_green Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?
phoebe_buffay Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.
rachel_green You went shopping for fur?
phoebe_buffay Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs.
rachel_green You bought boobs?
phoebe_buffay Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
joey_tribbiani Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.
annabel Oh, actually I sorta have plans.
the_hombre_man Ready, Annabelle?
annabel You bet. Maybe some other time?
joey_tribbiani Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?!
carol_willick Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
dr_ross_geller Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
susan_bunch Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
rachel_green Oh, this is so cute.
susan_bunch Oh, I got that for him.
dr_ross_geller My mommies love me. That's clever.
monica_geller Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju--Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
rachel_green Did you just say Hi, Jew?
monica_geller Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
phoebe_buffay Ben, dinner!
dr_ross_geller Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
phoebe_buffay Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
chandler_bing What did you just do?
phoebe_buffay I licked my arm, what?
dr_ross_geller It's breast milk.
phoebe_buffay So?
rachel_green Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
joey_tribbiani What is the big deal?
chandler_bing What did you just do?
dr_ross_geller Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
phoebe_buffay You won't even taste it?
dr_ross_geller No!
phoebe_buffay Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
dr_ross_geller Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
monica_geller Hey, where is everybody?
rachel_green They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
monica_geller Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
rachel_green Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon.
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
monica_geller You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
rachel_green And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
monica_geller That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
rachel_green Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
monica_geller Judy.
rachel_green Who?
monica_geller Julie.
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller Jody!
rachel_green You were with Julie?
monica_geller Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
rachel_green Oh. Oh my God.
monica_geller Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
rachel_green Yeah, right. Sure!
monica_geller Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
rachel_green Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
monica_geller That is not true!
rachel_green Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
monica_geller Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
rachel_green Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
monica_geller Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.
carol_willick@susan_bunch Hey!
carol_willick How did we do?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.
dr_ross_geller I did not freak out.
carol_willick Why'd you freak out?
dr_ross_geller Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
carol_willick My breast milk is gross?
susan_bunch This should be fun.
dr_ross_geller No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.
chandler_bing Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
carol_willick Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.
dr_ross_geller That would be no.
phoebe_buffay Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...
susan_bunch Cantaloupe juice.
joey_tribbiani Exactly.
dr_ross_geller You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
susan_bunch Uh huh.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you've tasted it.
susan_bunch You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.
dr_ross_geller Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
chandler_bing Howdy.
joey_tribbiani Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.
chandler_bing Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.
joey_tribbiani Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.
chandler_bing What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
joey_tribbiani I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.
chandler_bing All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?
joey_tribbiani Yeah I guess you're right.
chandler_bing You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna do it.
chandler_bing All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
monica_geller I don't know what else to say.
rachel_green Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
monica_geller I feel terrible, I really do.
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
monica_geller Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
rachel_green Yes.
monica_geller It's that terrible?
rachel_green Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
monica_geller Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
rachel_green I love you too.
phoebe_buffay You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.
monica_geller Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
rachel_green I'd do anything for you, you know that.
monica_geller I'd do anything for you.
phoebe_buffay Wait, wait, wait, wait!
joey_tribbiani Mornin'. I said, mornin'.
the_hombre_man I heard ya.
store_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode02 All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?
the_hombre_man Ready.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I'm ready.
customer You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!
store_guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode02 Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?
the_hombre_man I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
annabel My god, what happened?
joey_tribbiani These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?
annabel Sure.
julie So.
rachel_green So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
julie I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
rachel_green Really? Me?
julie Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
rachel_green Well, you're not totally paranoid.
julie Oy.
rachel_green Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
julie Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
rachel_green Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
julie I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
rachel_green All right, Julie.
julie Bye.
rachel_green Bye. What a manipulative bitch.
dr_ross_geller That's not bad.
