chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.
chandler_bing I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
monica_geller Well, I just lost my erection.
chandler_bing I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?
monica_geller You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.
chandler_bing But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.
monica_geller Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!
chandler_bing Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!
monica_geller I know!!! My erection is back!
joey_tribbiani Thank you!
phoebe_buffay Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?
joey_tribbiani Okay.
phoebe_buffay Thank you. Thank you!
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.
joey_tribbiani If you want I could loan you some money?
phoebe_buffay Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?
phoebe_buffay You could do that?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.
phoebe_buffay Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!
joey_tribbiani Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.
phoebe_buffay Oh, really?
joey_tribbiani No it is awesome!
dr_ross_geller Hi guys.
allphoebe#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?
dr_ross_geller Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?
joey_tribbiani She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?
rachel_green Well, because if one more person says "what a cute little boy" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!
dr_ross_geller I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?
monica_geller Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.
chandler_bing How long was I in there?
monica_geller Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.
chandler_bing Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!
monica_geller Don't you want to look through the rest?
chandler_bing I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.
monica_geller You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!
chandler_bing I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"
monica_geller I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."
chandler_bing Honey? Leave it to the pros.
monica_geller I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.
chandler_bing "The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones."
monica_geller "Marriage. It's not for everybody."
rachel_green That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.
rachel_green I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Who the hell are you?
rachel_green I'm the hell person whose office this is!
dr_ross_geller Good one, Rach.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job.
rachel_green Excuse me?
gavin_mitchell Oh, your baby's so cute. Why did you put a pink bow on a boy?
phoebe_buffay Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!
joey_tribbiani Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.
joey_tribbiani Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.
the_director Okay, okay, okay! You. Here, come here, here. You're gonna take this tray, you're gonna stay on this yellow mark. You're gonna move on "action!" You're gonna walk over to the operating table. You're gonna stop on that blue mark, you're gonna put the tray down. Don't walk too fast! But don't doddle.
phoebe_buffay Okay, now. What?
the_director And...Action!!
the_director Cut! Cut!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.
the_director Well, don't be.
phoebe_buffay Okay, that helps.
the_director And...Action!
the_director Cut!
joey_tribbiani Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.
the_director And...Action!
interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 So, do you have any other question about advertising?
chandler_bing No, no. But let me show you what I can do. "Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood."
interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency.
chandler_bing Really? That's great!
interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 It's an unpaid internship.
chandler_bing It's funny. When you said "unpaid" it sounded like you said "unpaid."
interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
chandler_bing Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.
interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Stop!
interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Okay.
rachel_green Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?
gavin_mitchell Well, while you were on your baby vacation I was doing your job.
rachel_green A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.
gavin_mitchell Clearly you've never been to Sandles Paradise Island.
rachel_green Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.
gavin_mitchell I can't say I care too much for that smell you've brought in with you.
rachel_green Excuse me?
dr_ross_geller Rach we have a code brown situation.
rachel_green Can you please, please take care of it for me?
dr_ross_geller Alright, but you have to do one sometime.
rachel_green Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?
gavin_mitchell Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together.
rachel_green That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.
gavin_mitchell I'm not a temp. I was transferred here from another department.
rachel_green Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?
gavin_mitchell Oh, they didn't tell me about your quick wit.
rachel_green Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?
mr_zelner Gavin, Ralph loved your ideas.
rachel_green Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.
mr_zelner Rachel, I see you've met Gavin. I must say, when you left us we weren't sure what we were gonna do. But then, Gavin to the rescue. Super Gavin!
rachel_green That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?
gavin_mitchell Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision.
rachel_green Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.
mr_zelner Incidentally, when are you coming back?
rachel_green Today.
gavin_mitchell You said two weeks.
rachel_green No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey. So, what did he say?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.
joey_tribbiani That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.
phoebe_buffay Joey.
joey_tribbiani No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!
phoebe_buffay Who dies?
joey_tribbiani Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.
phoebe_buffay Yes, doctor.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
the_director Okay, let's try this one more time.
phoebe_buffay Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!
the_director And...Action!
phoebe_buffay Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?
the_director The rest of the scene.
phoebe_buffay Okay, from the top, people!
rachel_green Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.
dr_ross_geller What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...
rachel_green Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.
dr_ross_geller What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.
rachel_green I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?
dr_ross_geller Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.
rachel_green Come on, I don't know what else to do.
dr_ross_geller Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.
rachel_green Ross?
dr_ross_geller Huh?
rachel_green You're pretty.
chandler_bing Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.
dr_ross_geller So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Good-bye.
monica_geller Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.
chandler_bing Yeah, Ross is here so...
dr_ross_geller Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?
monica_geller We're gonna have sex.
dr_ross_geller I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
monica_geller Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.
dr_ross_geller Pants off Bing!
rachel_green Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?
gavin_mitchell Well, I've changed your screensaver from that picture of *Nsync.
rachel_green Hey, they were popular when I left!
gavin_mitchell Also, I've just been working on this big presentation for tomorrow.
rachel_green Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?
gavin_mitchell That's gonna take weeks. Why don't just let me take care of the presentation?
rachel_green Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!
gavin_mitchell Fine.
rachel_green Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?
gavin_mitchell Hey, you've been here five years, you figure it out.
rachel_green Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!
dr_ross_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.
chandler_bing Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.
monica_geller Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.
dr_ross_geller Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!
monica_geller Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.
chandler_bing Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.
monica_geller What are you talking about?
chandler_bing That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.
monica_geller What!? You faked it?
dr_ross_geller You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual
phoebe_buffay Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?
joey_tribbiani Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.
phoebe_buffay Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.
joey_tribbiani Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.
phoebe_buffay Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.
joey_tribbiani Nice.
phoebe_buffay Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?
joey_tribbiani No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.
phoebe_buffay About what?
joey_tribbiani He slept with you and then never called you.
phoebe_buffay And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.
the_director Okay, okay, from the top. And...Action!
man#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 So, I'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.
joey_tribbiani I'm surprised to, but yet here I am.
the_director Cut, cut! What are you doing!?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.
female_extra_1 Me too!
another_extra#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 Me too!
joey_tribbiani Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!
gavin_mitchell Wow, you're here already.
rachel_green Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!
gavin_mitchell How do you fix the chair?
rachel_green Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.
mr_zelner Good, because it's in ten minutes.
rachel_green What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.
mr_zelner Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping.
rachel_green Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!
gavin_mitchell You can do the presentation.
rachel_green No, I can't, I have a baby.
gavin_mitchell I'll watch her.
rachel_green Why would you do that?
gavin_mitchell Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy.
rachel_green That's really nice.
gavin_mitchell I should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.
rachel_green Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.
gavin_mitchell I'm really fine, don't worry, I'm great with children. Gavin Mitchell. Pleased to meet you.
joey_tribbiani Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.
the_director Okay, okay. But this is her last chance.
joey_tribbiani Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?
joey_tribbiani Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?
phoebe_buffay I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.
joey_tribbiani You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.
phoebe_buffay Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.
joey_tribbiani What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.
monica_geller You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!
chandler_bing Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.
monica_geller Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?
chandler_bing That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.
monica_geller Like a month?
chandler_bing Or a year?
monica_geller Really, you want to wait a year?
chandler_bing It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. "Pants. Like shorts, but longer." It'll probably be more than a year.
monica_geller I really wanna have a baby.
chandler_bing Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.
monica_geller No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.
chandler_bing I quit and you learn what I do?
monica_geller It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.
chandler_bing I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.
monica_geller It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!
chandler_bing Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?
monica_geller Yes, please!
chandler_bing Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.
monica_geller I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!
joey_tribbiani I know you botched that operation on purpose. I can't prove it yet, but when I do, you'll be going to jail for murder. I don't care if you are my brother.
man#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode11 I'm not your brother.
phoebe_buffay What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!
