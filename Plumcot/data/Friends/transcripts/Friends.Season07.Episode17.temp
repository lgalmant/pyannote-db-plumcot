monica Chandler.
chandler Gap commercial. So did you book them? Did you call?
monica I will.
chandler Do you want me to call?
monica No, I'll do it. You just stick to your job.

chandler Staying out of the way.
joey This is impossible Monica, why don't you just pick all 15?
monica There were only twelve.
joey Oh yeah, I added three.
monica What are peanut butter fingers?!
joey Oh yeah
ross Well hello! She's cute! Should we uh, go try to talk to her?

kristen I...I uh, actually just moved from four blocks over.
ross Ah.
kristen But-but this block is like a whole other world.
ross Y'know actually it does have a very interesting history. Uh, this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system. Before that sewage and waste would just flow right down the street. Yeah, sometimes ankle deep!
chandler Smooth.
kristen Excuse me?
ross Umm, say you're gonna be starving after all this moving. What do you say I take you to dinner tonight?
kristen Oh I'd like that.

monica Oh, my fiancee wants the Swing Kings.
megan Oh, you're so lucky. My fiancee wants the heavy metal band Carcass.
phoebe Ooh, is that spelled with a 'C' or a 'K'? Oh my God! It doesn't matter; they're both great!
rachel Oh y'know what? Y'know what? Now that you know what you want you should go to Kleinman's and get it half off. This place is so overpriced.

ross Laugh all you want but uh, she actually left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.
chandler Huh.

chandler Excellent! Y'know Ross met somebody too!
joey Oh yeah?
ross Hey.
chandler Hi! How'd it go?

chandler Really?! Joe? What would you do if you were in Ross's situation?
joey Well, I sorta am. I mean yeah, I'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy. But, I don't know, I'm not to worried about it.
ross Well you shouldn't be. Believe me I wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you. I mean that doofus is going to lose!
chandler So this is nice! I wish I didn't have to go, believe me! But unfortunately I have to. Oh uh, by the way, what's the name the girl you're dating?
joey_and_ross Kristen Lang.
chandler Bye!
ross Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.
joey Obviously! So, how do we decide?
ross Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her
joey Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Or, or I'm the one who dates her.
ross That's interesting, but check this out. I date her
joey Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction
ross Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.
joey Yeah well we should order some food then.
ross No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll each go out with her one more time. And-and we'll see who she likes best.
joey That sounds fair.
ross Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street
joey Ah yeah-wait a second now! Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date. I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.
ross Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.
joey All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.
ross So let's decide on the spending limit
joey Yeah. Uh,..a slice......six dollars?
ross I was thinking more like a hundred.
joey Okay. Can I borrow 94 dollars?
monica Oh
phoebe I know. Hand me a tissue.
rachel You're out of Diet Coke.
monica Hello? What?! You what?! Hey you listen here missy! Wh-
phoebe What?!
monica That was that girl Megan! She booked the Swing Kings on the day of our wedding and said that I couldn't have them back unless I gave her the dress!
phoebe Does that mean Carcass is available?
monica What am I gonna do?! That is the dress! That is the dress! Wh...Chandler wants the band. What do I do?
phoebe Well just figure out a way to talk him out of it.
monica How?
rachel You're out of toilet paper!
joey Hey!
ross Hey! What's up?
joey I just wanted to come by and y'know, wish you good luck on your date.
ross Oh thanks!
joey Yeah. What time are you meeting her?
ross We have 8:00 reservations at Grammercy Bistero.
joey Wow, that's in like 20 minutes. You'd better get dressed.
ross I am dressed.
joey Oh. Well good! For me. What is this? Did you give yourself a facial?
ross I have an oily T-zone!
joey Okay dude! Hey you uh, you sent Kristen flowers.
ross That's right.
joey You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!
ross Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So techincally, technically I didn't break any rules. Thanks for stopping by though.
joey Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!
ross Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?
joey I don't know.
ross Why am I not surprised?
joey Y'know what Ross? I'm not gonna let you get away with this!
ross I don't think you have much choice.
joey Well we'll see!
ross Bye-bye!
joey Yeah bye-bye! Hey! So just a light layer?
ross Yes. Yes. Just here and there
chandler Joey got meat sauce on the banister again!
phoebe Yeah, swing music is so out.
monica Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.
chandler What are you guys talking about?
monica Well umm, we were just talking about the y'know, the Swing Kings and just wondering whether y'know, they were the right way to go.
rachel Yeah, I went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh, two months later the couple got divorced. And now I'm not saying that there's any connection here y'know, but they did tell me that's why they got divorced.
chandler But I love swing music!
phoebe Yeah but the Swing Kings? Y'know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts-They just stop living.
chandler Look all I know is when Monica and I went to see them, we had fun! And there's another reason too.
rachel Well, what is the other reason?
chandler I don't want to say.
rachel Well you have to because maybe it's stupid.
chandler Well it's just while Monica and I were dancing to them it was...the first time I knew that...you were the woman I wanted to dance all my dances with.
monica Oh crap!
ross So they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes.
kristen Oh great!
ross Yeah.
kristen Is your back feeling better?
ross Oh yeah it's fine. I guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control.
joey Kristen?
kristen Joey!
joey Hi!
kristen Hi! What are you doing here?
joey Oh I like this place. And technically, technically I'm not breaking any rules so I
kristen Well uh, Ross? This is Joey. Joey? Ross.
joey Hi!
ross Hi. It's nice to meet you. I used to have a friend named Joey. I don't anymore.
kristen Our table will be ready in a couple minutes.
ross Yeah. So
joey Sure! I would love to wait with you guys! Thanks!
ross So Joey umm, you look familiar. Are uh, are you on TV or something?
kristen Well Joey doesn't like to talk about it but, he's one of the stars of Days Of Our Lives.
ross That's right! That's right, don't you play a woman?
joey A woman in a man's body.
ross Much better.
joey So y'know Ross it's funny 'cause, you look familiar to me too. Have you ever been married?
ross Well yes, yes I have. In fact umm, just the other day Kristen and I were talking about how I've been married and how I have a son.
kristen Yeah, little Eric.
ross That's right! Wait no, Ben.
joey So you've just married the one time then?
ross Well umm
kristen You've been married twice?
ross Yes. And another time after that. Boy I'm getting hungry! Hey Joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food?
kristen You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
joey Yeah. So uh Ross, well now-why did that first marriage breakup? Was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian?
kristen Do you two know each other?
joey_and_ross No. No.
joey No. It just seems like Ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge.
ross Wait a minute! Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?
joey Have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey?!
ross Hey you leave Marcel out of this!
joey Fine! Have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?!
ross Hey-hey have you ever locked yourself in a TV cabinet VD boy?!
joey Monkey lover!
joey When do you think we lost her?
ross Probably around gonorrhea.
chandler Hi, honey! I'm home!
monica Don't come in here!
chandler Why? Do you another boyfriend in there or something?
monica No! We only mess around at his place!
chandler Y'know it's funny I started it but, now it's scary me. So could you come out here please?
monica No, I'm wearing a wedding dress.
chandler Oh you got a wedding dress? That's great!
monica Yeah but I'm not keeping it.
chandler Well then why can't I see it?
monica Oh. I guess you can. Okay but; I-I have to return it, so you can't like it.
chandler Okay I promise. I'll-I'll hate it. Wow! You-you look...hideous.
monica Really?
chandler Yeah, that's like the most ugliest dress I've ever seen. Wh-why do you to return it?
monica Oh because it doesn't...really fit. Oh by the way, I-I booked the Swing Kings.
chandler Oh that's great! Great! Thanks! But that dress I mean it's like yuck! It's terrible! It makes me wanna just rip it right off of you!
monica Okay! But you can't rip it. Well, maybe a little.
chandler Okay!
monica Hey guys! Do you wanna look at the song list for the wedding? Guys?
chandler I thought you were gonna be gone all day.
monica All right? What's going on?
monica I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I should probably leave you girls alone.
ross Yeah, laugh all you want but in ten minutes we're gonna have younger looking skin!
joey Yeah! Y'know, she could use a little... Oh nice shot!!!
