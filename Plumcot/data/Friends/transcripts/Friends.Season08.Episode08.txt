rachel_green Hey Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Huh?
rachel_green I'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow night, do you wanna come?
phoebe_buffay Sure. Yeah, he's kinda sexy.
rachel_green Oh no, no, I'll be there too.
phoebe_buffay Okay so, we'll just come up with some kind of signal if it's going well you can take off.
rachel_green No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Why not?
rachel_green 'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.
phoebe_buffay Oh Rachel, this is all so 'Papa don't preach.'
rachel_green What Phoebe? Wait! One time he caught me smoking he said if he ever saw me doing that again he'd make me eat the entire pack.
phoebe_buffay Wow! Oh well, I will be there!
rachel_green Thank you.
phoebe_buffay Gosh. I'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby. Oh. Hey! Who is that guy? I think I know him.
monica_geller No you don't!
rachel_green No you don't.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!!! Monica!! He's the stripper from your bachelorette party!!
chandler_bing Her what?!!
phoebe_buffay Your secret bachelorette party
chandler_bing You had a bachelorette party?!
phoebe_buffay She untied his G-string with her teeth. Somebody stop me!
chandler_bing I thought we weren't gonna have bachelor/bachelorette parties! Y'know, we agreed that it was a silly tradition.
joey_tribbiani It's a grand tradition!
monica_geller I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!
rachel_green Well you could've untied it with your hands.
joey_tribbiani This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!
chandler_bing You went home with the waitress.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.
chandler_bing I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!
monica_geller Ugh, I knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass!
dr_leonard_green How about I order everyone the Moroccan chicken?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I-I don't eat meat.
dr_leonard_green It's chicken.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I don't eat that either.
dr_leonard_green I'll never understand you lesbians. So baby, tell me...what is new with you.
rachel_green Well actually umm
the_waiter Your '74 Lafite sir.
dr_leonard_green '74?! I ordered the '75! That's a magnificent wine! The '74 is sewage! Why would you bring me sewage?! Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot? Is that why you're a waiter?
the_waiter This is why I told the manager I wouldn't wait on you tonight!
dr_leonard_green Oh come on! Don't be such a baby!
rachel_green In case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.
phoebe_buffay He's right though, the '74 is absolute piss.
rachel_green This was such a huge mistake. I can't tell him Phoebe. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't
phoebe_buffay Rachel!
rachel_green No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.
phoebe_buffay Why, so he can get mad at the baby?
rachel_green Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?
dr_leonard_green I have no idea, I went to the bathroom. So sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is uh, what is new with you.
rachel_green Well... Umm, I got TiVo.
dr_leonard_green What's TiVo?
phoebe_buffay It's slang for pregnant.
rachel_green Phoebe!
dr_leonard_green Are you really pregnant?
rachel_green Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.
dr_leonard_green Who is the father? Oh no! Please don't tell me it's her!
rachel_green No, it's Ross. It's Ross. You like Ross. Oh daddy, I hope you're okay with all of this. I mean think about it, this is a good thing. You're gonna-This is your first grandchild! You're gonna be a poppy!
dr_leonard_green That's true.
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_leonard_green Poppy. Oh, I'm gonna be a poppy. So when is the wedding?
rachel_green Who?
dr_leonard_green The wedding! There's going to be a wedding. Young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is going to be a bastard! Rachel Karen Green, tell me there is gonna be a wedding!!
rachel_green February 2nd!
mona So it was really cool seeing you lecture today.
dr_ross_geller Oh thanks. Although it kinda seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.
mona Oh no-no, I-I had my eyes closed so I could concentrate and y'know take it all in.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, a lot of my students do that.
mona So, I gotta get going.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I-I'll see you tonight.
mona Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Okay, bye.
mona Oh hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. It was amazing!
chandler_bing My God! You must be good in bed!
joey_tribbiani So uh, you and Mona, been a while now. How's it going?
dr_ross_geller Ah, it's good. It's going good. I mean, we get along great. She's, she's so
joey_tribbiani Hot?
dr_ross_geller Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah-huh!
chandler_bing She's okay with Rachel and the baby?
dr_ross_geller Well I...I haven't actually told her yet. I don't want to scare her off, y'know?
chandler_bing Well, you have to honest with her! Otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path, but you're really going down different ones.
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna take that book and beat you to death with it.
monica_geller Oh my God! You are gonna love me so much! I felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight you're gonna have a bachelor party.
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller Yeah, I got this number from this guy at work and I hired a stripper to come dance for you. Am I going in the wife hall of fame or what?!
chandler_bing Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper
joey_tribbiani Will you let the lady talk?!
monica_geller Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.
chandler_bing Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.
monica_geller So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.
dr_ross_geller Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!
monica_geller Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!
chandler_bing All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing And Joey.
monica_geller Thank you. All right, now who else do you want to invite?
chandler_bing Ah, no-no-no just Ross. Ross and Joey is embarrassing enough.
dr_ross_geller Uh actually, sorry I can't even make it. I'm seeing Mona again tonight.
chandler_bing I understand: who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry I gotta cancel tonight baby
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry I won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding, but I'm really busy that day. Yeah, I already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.
rachel_green I know. I know. I panicked, I panicked. I didn't want him to start yelling at me like I was some '74 Latour.
phoebe_buffay It's Lafite. The '74 Latour is actually drinking quite nicely.
rachel_green All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.
dr_leonard_green I just called a friend of mine.
rachel_green Yeah?
dr_leonard_green I think I may be able to book The Plaza on short notice.
rachel_green Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.
dr_leonard_green What is it sweetie?
rachel_green There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.
dr_leonard_green What?!
rachel_green I'm sorry daddy.
dr_leonard_green I don't believe this!!
rachel_green Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.
dr_leonard_green Stay calm?!! How do you expect me to stay calm?! This is unacceptable Rachel! And I wanna know why?!! Is it because that punk Ross won't marry you?! That's it! Is that it?!
rachel_green Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.
joey_tribbiani So you uh, nervous about getting married?
chandler_bing What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.
chandler_bing Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.
joey_tribbiani How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.
chandler_bing You're right, this is more fun.
joey_tribbiani That's her! Okay, come on!
stripper#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode08 Hi!
chandler_bing Hi.
stripper#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode08 So which one of you lucky boys is Chandler?
joey_tribbiani Uh, that-that's-that's me!
chandler_bing That's me.
joey_tribbiani Joey Tribbiani, a big fan.
stripper#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode08 So is that a bedroom?
chandler_bing Yeah, yeah right over there.
stripper#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode08 All right, whenever you're ready.
chandler_bing That was weird.
joey_tribbiani Why-why would she go in the bedroom?
stripper#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode08 I'm waiting.
chandler_bing So she's a
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that's one naked hooker!
mona I love your place! Where is this guy from?
dr_ross_geller Uh that's an eighteenth century Indian artifact from Calcutta.
mona Oh wow! So, you're more than just dinosaurs.
dr_ross_geller So much more.
mona Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm so sorry!
dr_ross_geller Aw forget it, it's from Pier One. Sorry.
dr_leonard_green You think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?! I'm gonna kill you!!
dr_ross_geller Y'know this is actually not a great time for me.
dr_leonard_green So? Come on! Explain yourself Geller! First you get my Rachel pregnant!
mona You got Rachel pregnant?!
dr_ross_geller Who did?!
dr_leonard_green You did!
dr_ross_geller Yes. Yes, yes I did. But-but it was, it was just a one night thing. It meant nothing.
dr_leonard_green Oh? Really? That's what my daughter means to you? Nothing?
dr_ross_geller No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.
mona What?!
dr_ross_geller Oh but not that way. I mean...I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.
dr_leonard_green Oh really? That's how treat a friend? You get her in trouble and then refuse to marry her?
dr_ross_geller Hey! I offered to marry her!
mona Wh
dr_ross_geller But I didn't want to.
dr_leonard_green Well why not? So you can spend your time with this tramp?!
mona Tramp?!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.
chandler_bing I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!
joey_tribbiani Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.
chandler_bing Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?
the_hooker Uh, no. But I could pretend to strip, but that's gonna cost extra. Okay, here's the extras, handcuffs, spanking
joey_tribbiani Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.
chandler_bing That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.
joey_tribbiani I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.
the_hooker Do you mind if I smoke in here?
chandler_bing Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.
mona How could you have kept all of this from me?
dr_ross_geller I was going to tell you, but
dr_leonard_green But what?! You figured you'd get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped Rachel!
dr_ross_geller Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross. It's Joey. There's a hooker over here and we thought maybe you'd know something about it.
dr_ross_geller No! No! No! No! No! I-I-I-I-I need to, I need to lie down.
stu So, tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?
monica_geller Yeah! Hey! Thanks for getting me that girl's number.
stu No problem. So who's the party for?
monica_geller My husband.
stu You hired your husband a hooker?
monica_geller She's a stripper.
stu No, she's a hooker.
monica_geller Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?
stu When they're hookers.
monica_geller Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?
stu Either that or she's just the best, most expensive date I ever had.
joey_tribbiani Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
chandler_bing Why would she do that?
joey_tribbiani Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?
chandler_bing This is the worst bachelor party ever!
the_hooker What's taking you boys so long?
joey_tribbiani In a minute!
chandler_bing In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!
joey_tribbiani All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.
chandler_bing Why me?!
joey_tribbiani Hey! It's your bachelor party.
chandler_bing Which is why you should do it.
joey_tribbiani I don't want to. You do it!
chandler_bing You do it!
joey_tribbiani You do it!
chandler_bing All right Rock, Paper, Scissors who has to tell the whore to leave! What?
joey_tribbiani I miss this.
chandler_bing I don't think we've actually done this before!
joey_tribbiani No, I-I miss hanging out with you.
chandler_bing Well we...we still hang out.
joey_tribbiani Not like we used to. Remember? You and me used to be inseparable. Y'know now it's like...things are different.
chandler_bing Well y'know, things are different. I'm...I'm married now.
joey_tribbiani Oh sure-And hey, don't get me wrong, I am so happy for you guys. I just...I miss...hanging out...just-just us, y'know?
chandler_bing Yeah, I miss that too. I tell you what; from now on we'll make time to hang out with each other.
joey_tribbiani You got it. Come here.
the_hooker Oh God! Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.
monica_geller She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a... Hi! Uh, we spoke on the phone.
dr_ross_geller So your dad dropped by. He's a pleasant man!
rachel_green Oh no
phoebe_buffay I'd better go. Just over here: I don't want to miss the fight.
rachel_green Ross I'm so sorry. Okay. I-I will promise I will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person, or via e-mail.
dr_ross_geller I don't care about your dad! I care about Mona! She was there and now she's totally freaked out!
rachel_green Oh okay, I'll fix that to. What's her e-mail address?
dr_ross_geller Rachel!
rachel_green All right, I promise. I'll fix this. I swear. I'll-I'll-I'll-I'll talk to her.
dr_ross_geller Okay!
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Thank you!
phoebe_buffay That's it?! You call that a fight? Come on! "We were on a break!" "No we weren't!" What happened to you two?!
dr_ross_geller Thank you so much for coming back over.
mona Oh good, you're here. Yeah, and I was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.
rachel_green I know Mona, just hear me out. First of all, I'm so sorry about my father yelling at you, but I heard you totally held your own. You're gonna have to tell me how you did that.
dr_ross_geller Focus.
rachel_green Okay. Um...But-Okay, yes Ross and I used to date. And yes we are gonna have a baby. But we are definitely not getting back together.
mona How can I be sure on that?
rachel_green Oh we just-we drove each other crazy!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green I mean he was possessive, he was jealous, he could never just let the little things go!
dr_ross_geller Trying to date this woman.
rachel_green Right! But, none of that compared to how kind and-and how gentle and thoughtful he is.
dr_ross_geller Probably shouldn't touch me.
mona Y'know, I-I-I just...I don't want to get in the middle of something so complicated.
rachel_green I know, I get it, but Mona, what relationship is not complicated? I mean we all have our baggage! You must too! Why else would you still be single? I am so gonna leave right now.
dr_ross_geller Should I leave this open for you too?
mona I'm not sure yet. Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
dr_ross_geller Because what's going on with Rachel has nothing to do with how I feel about you.
mona Yeah? Well you still shoulda told me.
dr_ross_geller I know and I was going to, but I thought it was better that you heard it from Rachel's father. Look I...I made a mistake, but it's only because I really, really like you. Really!
mona Okay, I guess you can...close the door now.
rachel_green Forgot my purse! Oh, you guys made up. He's a good kisser isn't he? I'm going!
monica_geller I swear I didn't know she was a hooker! I mean wh-Did you let her smoke in here?
chandler_bing Her ass print is still on your grandmother's quilt, do you really want to talk about smoking?
monica_geller Y'know what? I'm gonna make this up to you. I promised you a stripper , and you're gonna get a stripper.
chandler_bing Monica! Wait!
monica_geller What?
chandler_bing Carry on.
monica_geller Ooh, these tennis shoes are so tight. I think I'll take them off.
chandler_bing Could you not narrate?
monica_geller Gotcha sailor.
dr_leonard_green ...just because you're not in love with the guy you can't
phoebe_buffay Wow, you told your dad the truth.
rachel_green About an hour ago.
phoebe_buffay Wanna go see a movie?
rachel_green Yes! Bye daddy.
dr_leonard_green ...there's gonna be a wedding! That's unacceptable Rachel! What the hell does love have to do with it anyway?! There are more important things in a marriage other than love!..constantly thinking about things! You have to think about the consequences of your decision.
joey_tribbiani Hey! I do too think about the consequences of my decisions! What gives you the right to... Go to hell! Stupid guy on my phone.
