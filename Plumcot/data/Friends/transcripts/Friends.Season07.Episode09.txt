ben_geller I'm ready!
dr_ross_geller You sure?
ben_geller Uh-huh!
chandler_bing Okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.
ben_geller Thanks daddy.
dr_ross_geller No-no, one daddy, two mommies. All right, it's all yours.
chandler_bing Okay. Okay.
dr_ross_geller Yes! Yes! Yes!!
phoebe_buffay His first big kid's bike, this is so exciting!
monica_geller Oh yeah, I remember mine! Ohh, it was my sixth birthday, my dad took me to the park, I got it, and...it bent.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay I never had a bike of my own.
dr_ross_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay Well, we didn't have a lot of money. But the girl across the street had the best bike! It was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips, and-and-and a bell and this big, white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on.
chandler_bing That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.
dr_ross_geller Ohh.
monica_geller Did the girl ever let you ride it?
phoebe_buffay No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.
dr_ross_geller That is so unfair!
phoebe_buffay Not really, I got to drag him around too!
chandler_bing Hey! What are you guys doing?
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Making holiday candy for the neighbors.
chandler_bing I'm sorry, who?
monica_geller I'm gonna hang this basket on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece.
chandler_bing But we don't know the neighbors.
joey_tribbiani I do. There's uh, let's see, Guy With a Mustache, Smokes-A-Lot Lady, Some Kids I've Seen, and A Red-haired Guy Who Does Not Like To Be Called Rusty.
monica_geller See? This is exactly why I'm making this candy. We can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.
chandler_bing Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?
rachel_green Gooood morning!!
chandler_bing Eh, somebody's in a good mood!
rachel_green Well, why shouldn't I be? I have great friends! I have a wonderful job!
monica_geller Where you can make out with your assistant.
rachel_green Come on, it's not a big deal! We stayed up all night coming up with a plan so that us dating will not be a problem.
monica_geller Oh yeah, what's the plan?
rachel_green We... We are not.....going to let it... be a problem.
monica_geller Wow! It took you all night to come up with that plan?!
rachel_green Well y'know, we did other stuff too.
monica_geller Did you two
rachel_green Oh Monica come on, y'know I don't sleep with guys on the first date!
monica_geller Matt Guire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wire
rachel_green Anymore!!
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green Hi. Tag, I have a conference call today is that correct?
tag_jones Yes, at 4:00.
rachel_green Okay, thank you. That'll be all. Wait! Wait! Did you see that? That mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.
tag_jones I'd better get back to my desk.
rachel_green Okay, you hard worker! I'll remember to put that in your evaluation.
tag_jones My what?
rachel_green Well, you've been here for two months now and your boss is required to hand in a performance evaluation. But y'know, there is one thing that I have yet to evaluate.
tag_jones Are you serious?
rachel_green No, I've just always wanted to do that. Can you help me clean this up?
monica_geller The basket is totally empty! My God, the neighbors ate all the candy!
chandler_bing Well, either that or uh
monica_geller Joey!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
monica_geller Did you eat all the neighbor candy?!
joey_tribbiani Uh well yeah, that was the plan, but by the time I got to it there was only a couple of pieces left!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and they've been coming by all day. They love it!
monica_geller They love my candy? Oh man!!! I've gotta go make more!!
joey_tribbiani Hey Mon, you might wanna make some more lasagna too, because something might've happened to a huge chunk of it.
monica_geller Ross! The neighbors ate all my candy!!
dr_ross_geller Mine stole my newspaper! It's like a crime wave!! Pheebs, you uh, you got a second.
phoebe_buffay Sure!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, ever since you uh, told me that story about that bike I-I couldn't stop thinking about it. I mean, everyone should have a-a first bike, so
phoebe_buffay Oh my God Ross!!
dr_ross_geller You like it?
phoebe_buffay I love it!!
dr_ross_geller Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Ohh!! Ohh!! And I love you!
dr_ross_geller Ahh.
phoebe_buffay Not that way! But the bike brought you a lot closer!
dr_ross_geller Ah! Well uh-uh, t-take it downstairs, y'know give it a test ride.
phoebe_buffay Okay! Oh my God! My first bike! Thank you for the best present I've ever gotten.
dr_ross_geller You're welcome.
phoebe_buffay Oh and Chandler's about to cry.
chandler_bing Am not!
monica_geller Who is that?!
chandler_bing Don't worry, I'm brave! I am brave! I...I am brave! No-no-no-no!! Can you tell me who is there please?
the_knocker#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode09 My name is Gary, I live upstairs.
gary Hi!
monica_geller Hi. Do you know what time it is?
gary It's candy time! My roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.
monica_geller Oh please! Did you hear that? Little drops of heaven.
chandler_bing 4:00 A.M.
gary So, can I get some candy?
chandler_bing I am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work! He does not know that I am not some of us.
monica_geller Umm, listen I am sorry, but I'll put some out first thing in the morning.
gary Well okay, I'll swing by later. Do you live in this building?
monica_geller Um-hmm.
gary Mm! Seems like I would've remembered you!
chandler_bing Mm! Night Gar'!
rachel_green So did you read your evaluation yet?
tag_jones No! It was marked confidential I just sent it down to Human Resources.
rachel_green Okay please, you're kidding right?! I wrote that one as a joke for you!
tag_jones A joke they would appreciate?
rachel_green I'm thinkin' no.
tag_jones What did you say?!
rachel_green Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.
tag_jones No, not my touchie.
rachel_green Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, "Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision," and under Problems with Performance I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not," and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.
monica_geller Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.
joey_tribbiani Almost cried huh? Hear that Chandler? Almost cried!
chandler_bing Hey, you cry every time somebody talks about Titanic!
joey_tribbiani Those two only had each other!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe really likes the bike huh?
monica_geller Oh yeah! I saw her walkin' it down the street the other day. She had uh, these flowers in the basket. It was so cute.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I saw her this morning walkin' it by the park.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, she was walking the bike? Both times?
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Oh hi!
chandler_bing Hey! So are you enjoying the bike?
phoebe_buffay Ohh, uh-huh so much!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs you uh...you do know how to ride a bike don't you?
phoebe_buffay Of course!
monica_geller Umm, can we see you ride it?
phoebe_buffay Okay. See?
monica_geller See, this is why I told you never get involved with your assistant! And here is no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to affairs. Did you hear that Chandler? No such thing!
chandler_bing What happened? I'm just eating candy.
rachel_green Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.
chandler_bing Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.
rachel_green Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!
joey_tribbiani Hey Rach?
rachel_green Yeah?
joey_tribbiani That sketch you mentioned? Might it have looked a little something like this?
rachel_green Oh my God! Joey!
chandler_bing What is the matter with you?
rachel_green Ugh!
joey_tribbiani Boy I tell ya, this little talent came in handy before I could afford porn.
the_woman Hi! I'm sorry, I know it's after hours but I really need candy.
monica_geller I'm sorry, I can't help you. See? Rules are rules.
the_woman Please! I have people coming from out of town today! And, I told them all about your candy!
monica_geller No kidding, out of towners huh? What did you tell 'em?
the_woman I told 'em your candy is absolutely indescribable!
monica_geller Some people have been saying its y'know little drops of heaven, but whatever.
the_woman Please, can't you help me out?
joey_tribbiani Hey Chandler, do we know that lady?
chandler_bing Maybe, isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?
monica_geller All right, I'll do it just this once! But you can't tell anybody!
the_woman Yes! Yes! Please, just give it to me!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Yeah, that's her.
the_woman Thank you.
monica_geller It's unbelievable! I-I can't believe that sign didn't work!
chandler_bing Y'know what would work?
monica_geller Hmm?
chandler_bing Stop making candy!
monica_geller But they like it!
chandler_bing You mean they like you.
monica_geller Maybe.
chandler_bing Is that why you became a chef? So that people would like you?
monica_geller Oh, you really want to talk about getting people to like you huh, funny man?
dr_ross_geller Okay, now just remember everything I taught you and you'll be fine. Okay? Here we go. Ready...Set
phoebe_buffay Wait! This seat is really uncomfortable! Yeah, maybe before we start we should just get another one. Perhaps, like an airplane seat-or a beanbag chair!
dr_ross_geller Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!
phoebe_buffay Why? Why do I have to learn?
dr_ross_geller Well...In-in case of emergency.
phoebe_buffay What kind of an emergency?
dr_ross_geller Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, "You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you."
phoebe_buffay Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.
dr_ross_geller Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?
phoebe_buffay You won't let go?
dr_ross_geller No!
phoebe_buffay Swear?!
dr_ross_geller I swear!
phoebe_buffay Okay.
dr_ross_geller Come on. All right, here we go. All right?
phoebe_buffay All right.
dr_ross_geller All right. Feel good?
phoebe_buffay Well
dr_ross_geller All right, try pedaling.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
dr_ross_geller That's it, your doing great.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
dr_ross_geller Doing great! Yes-yes-yes! Take control! Yes!
phoebe_buffay Weee!!!
dr_ross_geller Yes!! Yes!!!
phoebe_buffay Oh! Oh! Oh no!! You swore!
dr_ross_geller I-I just thought you were doing so well. I
phoebe_buffay I am shocked! Shocked!!
dr_ross_geller It's a legitimate learning technique. Wow!
dr_ross_geller Hey, there's uh, some people outside, askin' about candy.
monica_geller Well, they're just gonna have to wait aren't they? I've only got two hands!!
dr_ross_geller Need some help?
monica_geller No! You don't know the system! There'll be nobody messing with the system!
dr_ross_geller By the way, the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, hello liar.
dr_ross_geller Look, I-I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.
phoebe_buffay I could've been killed I hope you know!
dr_ross_geller I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.
dr_ross_geller Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay What?! What the hell?!
dr_ross_geller All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.
phoebe_buffay What?! Why?!
dr_ross_geller Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.
phoebe_buffay All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.
dr_ross_geller Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.
phoebe_buffay Okay Ross! Please don't die!
rachel_green Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.
tag_jones That's kinda sad.
rachel_green Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.
tag_jones Got it!
rachel_green Let's roll!
mr_zelner Hello Rachel, you uh, got a minute?
rachel_green Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.
mr_zelner Uh actually, I'd like to speak with both of you.
rachel_green Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?
mr_zelner Umm, no. Thanks, but I'll give these to Betty. So I read your evaluation of Tag, or to use his full name, Tag Sweetcheeks Jones. Is something going on with you two?
rachel_green Oh my God. Can you imagine if there was?! I mean, what would happen exactly.
mr_zelner Well, I'd be forced to file a report. I'd have to consult with the legal department, and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.
rachel_green Well
tag_jones Uh Mr. Zelner, I'm the one who filled in that evaluation.
rachel_green Oh no-no-no
tag_jones Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, I thought it would be funny.
mr_zelner You wrote that you have a cute touchie?
tag_jones Yes. I have a weird sense of humor, and I'm kinda strangely proud of my butt.
mr_zelner It's kind of a risky joke Tag, and what is-what is this drawing I can't figure out what this is?
rachel_green You're lookin' at it upside down-y'know what? It doesn't matter.
mr_zelner Yeah, it's not like I don't have a sense of humor, huh? Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick now and then. But there's a time and a place, huh?! Unless you uh, have a limerick right now? No? Okay, well uh, you've got my fax number.
rachel_green Whoa! I can't believe you did that. That was really sweet.
tag_jones No, don't worry about it.
rachel_green No, you could've lost your job.
tag_jones Are you kidding me?! With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.
rachel_green Thank you! You're great!
tag_jones Y'know what?
rachel_green What?
tag_jones I feel great. In fact! What?
rachel_green I... It just-it took me so long to get that desk organized.
tag_jones Oh, I'm sorry.
rachel_green There it is.
chandler_bing What is going on?
the_man#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode09 We're waiting for the candy. Bring out the candy!
joey_tribbiani Yeah lady! Give us candy!!
chandler_bing Joey!
joey_tribbiani What's up buddy?
chandler_bing What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Waiting for candy.
chandler_bing Get in here! Hey, and you can not smoke in here! Merry Christmas.
monica_geller Okay, guys! The candy is coming; I just need another 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool!
all@ We want candy! We want candy now!
chandler_bing All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?
the_man#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode09 Candy Lady?
chandler_bing No not Candy Lady.
joey_tribbiani Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!
chandler_bing All right, y'know what? Forget it, all of you forget it! You've ruined it! Go home! You've ruined it! You've ruined it!
joey_tribbiani That's right, it's all ruined! You guys ruined everything! You ruined it!
monica_geller Thank you.
chandler_bing You're welcome.
monica_geller Did you smoke?
chandler_bing No! Smokes-A-Lot Lady blew smoke directly into my mouth. Eh-uh-are you okay?
monica_geller I'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while. I mean, someone slipped a-a threatening note under the door.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know
phoebe_buffay I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.
dr_ross_geller Oh hey, don't thank me, thank yourself. You're the one who faced her fears and ultimately overcame them.
phoebe_buffay Don't be so corny Ross, it's not an after-school special.
