joey_tribbiani Morning!
rachel_green Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?
joey_tribbiani Pretty good.
rachel_green Oh good. Ahhh! My God, sorry!
joey_tribbiani Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I'm late for work.
rachel_green What-what?! You're gonna leave this person with me?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah-Hey, don't worry, she's a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I'm not looking for a serious relationship; that'd be great.
rachel_green Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!
joey_tribbiani Just casually slip it in, y'know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, I'm a loner-No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.
rachel_green Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?
joey_tribbiani Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.
rachel_green Well forget it, I'm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.
joey_tribbiani Fine! Now, where'd we land on those pancakes?
joeys_date#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 Hi!
rachel_green Hi.
joeys_date#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 Sorry about that, but I couldn't get that lock to work on the door.
rachel_green Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.
joeys_date#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 You must be Rachel, I'm Erin.
rachel_green Hi.
erin Hi. I don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?
rachel_green Would you like some pancakes?
chandler_bing ...Come on! Why are we here?!
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay take a guess.
chandler_bing The hot chicks?
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, y'know-y'know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! It's here! Yeah, it's right-it's right down here! In the biggest library in the university!
chandler_bing Wow that's actually pretty cool.
dr_ross_geller Oh umm, there's also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. What is that?
chandler_bing Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.
the_girl_student I'm so sorry!
the_guy_student Sorry!
chandler_bing You didn't bring me here to do that, did you?
monica_geller She sent the chicken back again?!
the_waitress#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 She says it's to dry now and she wants to come back here and explain to you exactly how she wants it.
monica_geller Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!
the_colonel#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 OH...MY...GAWD!!!!
monica_geller Lucky bastard! Janice.
janice How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever!
monica_geller I'm fine.
janice Ohh! What is that on your finger?! I'm blind!
monica_geller Oh... Uh
janice So, who's the lucky guy?
chandler_bing OH...MY...GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didn't tell her we were getting married, did you?
monica_geller Well, she saw the ring.
chandler_bing Did she freak out?
monica_geller Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.
chandler_bing Right.
monica_geller Well, she actually has a boyfriend y'know herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.
chandler_bing You said no right?
monica_geller Huh?
chandler_bing You said no right?!
monica_geller Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!
chandler_bing Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check's in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I can't wait to read your book Ross!!
monica_geller Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won't be so bad.
chandler_bing What do you think she's just gonna sit there quietly? You don't think she's gonna want to make a toast? You don't think she's gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!
monica_geller Oh my God, she's not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!
chandler_bing Y'know what? It's gonna be okay. Y'know what? She's probably not gonna even want to come.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?
monica_geller So-so you would've just lied?
chandler_bing Yes!!
monica_geller Would it really have been that easy?
chandler_bing Yes!!!
monica_geller Good, so do it Saturday night because we're going to dinner with her and Clark.

phoebe_buffay We want you to marry her!
joey_tribbiani What?!!
phoebe_buffay She is so amazing! You have no idea.
joey_tribbiani No idea? Who do you think brought her here?
rachel_green Cupid.
phoebe_buffay Joey, she's so cool. She speaks four languages.
joey_tribbiani Man, do you know what guys want!
rachel_green Look Joey, come on she's so perfect for you! I mean she's sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.
joey_tribbiani My beers?! Look you guys, she's a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I just-I don't see it going anywhere.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but you always say that.
rachel_green Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.
joey_tribbiani Look I'm sorry you guys, I-I just don't think so.
phoebe_buffay Whatever.
rachel_green Fine.
joey_tribbiani Hey, don't start judging me! Huh? You're the one who's in love with her assistant! Huh? And you, you're the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!
rachel_green Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Secret affair!
dr_ross_geller People are doing it in front of my book!
rachel_green I'm sorry?
dr_ross_geller My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makin' babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!
rachel_green Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?
dr_ross_geller Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.
rachel_green Yeah, there was. It was-there the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever read-Yes, there was.
dr_ross_geller Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it's like uh-a thing!
joey_tribbiani Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?
dr_ross_geller Oh for cryin' out loud!
joey_tribbiani All right, so we should go catch our movie.
rachel_green Well now what's the rush?
joey_tribbiani I like to see the previews. The candy.
phoebe_buffay Oh. Hey!
rachel_green Well look who's here!
erin Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
erin Joey.
joey_tribbiani Erin.
erin Hey Rachel.
rachel_green Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!
erin What's wrong?
rachel_green Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.
phoebe_buffay Oh no.
joey_tribbiani What party?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green A birthday party.
joey_tribbiani Who's birthday party?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Allison's birthday party.
joey_tribbiani Oh, and how is Allison?
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green 32.
rachel_green Wait a minute! Why don't you guys do something?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, look how that worked out.
dr_ross_geller Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?
the_librarian Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.
dr_ross_geller No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?!
the_head_librarian How can I help you?
dr_ross_geller Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.
the_head_librarian We are aware of the problem you are referring too. But as far as increasing security, I'm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I can't help you.
dr_ross_geller Well, fine. Fine! If-if I'm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, I'll go up there and defend it myself! And don't you follow me!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green How did it go with Erin?
joey_tribbiani Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!
phoebe_buffay Yay!! Oh so, you're not, you're not mad at us anymore?
joey_tribbiani No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Y'know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.
phoebe_buffay Didn't you sleep together?
joey_tribbiani Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well that's a
rachel_green Oh my God! Listen to you talkin' about having kids. Oh my Joey. Oh, please don't get married before I do.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
janice Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!
monica_geller He might still show up.
janice Oh, what are you, stupid? It's been three hours.
monica_geller Is that all?
janice I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don't you tell about your lovely wedding?
chandler_bing Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, it's going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We're not even sure why we're having it.
monica_geller It's actually going to be just family.
janice Oh...wait...you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?
joey_tribbiani How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!
erin What about Benitez?
joey_tribbiani What about Game 1 of the Series?
erin What about shut up?
joey_tribbiani You shut up! I love arguing with her. I'll be right back.
erin Okay.
rachel_green So how's it goin' with Joey?
erin Uh, okay.
rachel_green Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.
erin Look, he's a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just don't see this having a future.
rachel_green But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!
erin Kinda.
phoebe_buffay Then change it back!
erin I'm sorry I... It's just there's no real spark.
phoebe_buffay No spark? Didn't you sleep together?
erin Yeah.
rachel_green Ugh, tramp!
phoebe_buffay Does Joey have any idea?
erin I really don't think he does. And y'know what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Y'know, tell him I'm-I'm not interested in a serious relationship or something.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you mean like that you're kind of a loner.
erin Yeah! That would be great!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, and maybe that you're a real
erin I'm sorry?
phoebe_buffay Oh well, I guess Italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.
joey_tribbiani Hey! You wanna go?
erin Yeah, let's go.
joey_tribbiani Okay. See you guys later.
erin Bye guys.
rachel_green Yeah, see ya.
joey_tribbiani Hey, thank you so much.
rachel_green Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.
phoebe_buffay No, just a regular old flying dwarf.
dr_ross_geller Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 Yeah, we were...we were just looking around.
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, you're-you're fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings on the Smiledon Californicus?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season07.Episode07 Uhh....
dr_ross_geller Ah... Ah...Get out of here! Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion's views on evolution?
the_woman Uh, actually I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
dr_ross_geller I find Marion's views far to progressionist.
the_woman I'm sorry, who are you?
dr_ross_geller I'm a professor here uh, Ross...Geller.
the_woman Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It's uh-Wait! Did you write this?
dr_ross_geller Yes! You're the person who checked out my book?!
the_woman Y'know, you look nothing like I would've thought. You're...you're so young.
dr_ross_geller Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.
dr_ross_geller I am very...very sorry.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
phoebe_buffay So how was, how was your date?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still... And guess what, I'm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.
phoebe_buffay Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?
joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no! It's a surprise, but it's gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Oh no, yeah.
rachel_green Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, she's not lookin' for a serious relationship.
joey_tribbiani Where are you gettin' this?
rachel_green Well, she told me. She said she's kinda a loner.
joey_tribbiani Oh. Oh.
rachel_green Joey
joey_tribbiani No hey Rach, it's cool okay? Y'know I'm a loner too! Right?
phoebe_buffay Hey Joey, y'know what? You are way to good for her.
rachel_green Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell 'em you're not looking for a relationship.
joey_tribbiani No! No. Don't do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.
rachel_green Well that too. Joey?
joey_tribbiani Yeah?
rachel_green Do you want some pancakes?
joey_tribbiani Finally!
monica_geller What are we gonna do?
chandler_bing I say we go with Careless Whisper.
janice Chandler?
chandler_bing Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
monica_geller Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?
janice Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldn't really be alone tonight. I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.
monica_geller Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?
janice Please, it's because otherwise I really don't know what I might do.
chandler_bing Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?
janice Do you have any tissues?
monica_geller Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.
janice Okay!
monica_geller We'll just...we'll just let her stay.
chandler_bing No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!
monica_geller Kinda like your Barca lounger.
chandler_bing Is that what you're thinking about right now?
monica_geller I never stop thinking about it.
janice Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.
chandler_bing Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.
janice Why not?
chandler_bing Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.
janice Okay, I'm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. Do you have a cat? 'Cause it's already happening. Do you hear that?
monica_geller Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!
janice Why?
monica_geller Because Chandler still has feelings for you!
janice He does?
chandler_bing Say again?
monica_geller That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.
chandler_bing Feelings, such strong feelings.
monica_geller I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.
janice Oh...my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I'll go. Good-bye Monica , I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, you call me when this goes in the pooper.
dr_ross_geller Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.
chandler_bing I just wanted to show Monica your book.
