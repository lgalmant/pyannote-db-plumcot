monica Hey guys!
rachel Hi!
phoebe Hey!
monica We need to talk to you about something.
chandler Yeah. We don't feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year.
all What?
phoebe Hey!
ross Are you kidding?
chandler Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.
ross That doesn't sound like you... That's Monica talking!
chandler No, no! We made this decision together.
ross She's putting words in your mouth!
joey Don't you put words in people's mouths, you put turkey in people's mouths!
rachel I can't believe this! This is Emma's first Thanksgiving!
monica No, it's not!
rachel It's not? When was she born?
phoebe Well, personally I think it's great you're giving yourself a break.
monica Thank you, Pheebs!
phoebe Sure. It's just as well... I mean, last year wasn't very good. I think she's losing her touch.
monica What? You are way off, lady!
phoebe Am I? Really? Am I? Well, why don't you cook Thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong! Well, think about it, think about it, you'll be trying to top than you did last year. You'd be in competition... with yourself.
monica That's my favourite kind! Okay, we are doing this!
chandler Don't let yourself get manipulated this way!
monica Hey, stay out of this, Chandler! This is between me... and ME!
chandler We are supposed to make these decisions together! Did you not watch the Doctor Phil I taped for you?
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!
phoebe Oh, yeah, happy needless-turkey-murder day.
monica You guys, I ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on Bleecker. Could you pick them up for me?
phoebe You're not making the pies yourself?
monica No, no, no, I don't make chocolate pies. When I was younger I-I enter in this pie-eating contest. I ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick.
rachel Did you at least win the contest?
monica 2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4.
rachel Can't wait!
monica This dinner is gonna be so great! In your face, last year "me"!
phoebe Hey Rach.
rachel Yeah.
phoebe What's Emma doing today?
rachel Well, let's see... uh... I know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop. Why?
phoebe Well, I wanna enter her in a baby beauty pageant.
rachel Oh my God! That's the creepiest thing I've ever heard!
phoebe Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!
rachel Oh! Phoebe, all babies are beautiful!
phoebe Oh... okay.
rachel Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy...
rachel And a thousand dollars.
rachel ..is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important...
phoebe Okay, oh, and Emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.
rachel Where am I gonna get a cowgirl outfit on Thanksgiving?
phoebe Well, I was thinking...
rachel Oh, take the clothes of Joey's Cabbage Patch Kid.
phoebe Yeah!
monica Did someone drop the baton again?
chandler Why come all the way from Kansas to do that?
monica I don't get older. I just get better!
chandler You know what just occurred to me? This could be our last Thanksgiving just the two of us. I mean, we could be getting a baby soon!
monica You don't know that.
chandler Somebody is gonna pick us.
monica Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!
chandler I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!
monica Name one of his books.
chandler "The Firm"?
monica Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready...
chandler You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year.
monica Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do.
chandler I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing "high profile".
monica Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it.
chandler Tell me more.
monica Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!
chandler You obviously haven't tasted my Palmolive potatoes!
ross Hey! Hey, guess what Joey has!
joey Three tickets to today's Rangers game!!
ross Dude, I wanted him to guess.
joey Oh.
chandler Oh my God!
joey Yeah, they're great seats too!
ross Guess where they are?
joey Center ice.
ross Did I do something to you?
chandler Hmm, the game's at one.
ross So?
chandler Dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.
joey So we'll leave before it's over, we'll be back in time.
chandler You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.
joey Dude, two times that happened!
chandler Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!
ross He's right, man.
joey Right, I guess. Alright, so see you at four.
chandler Okay. And get ready to taste my very special cranberries. Or should I say... chanberries!
joey That's some gentle comedy, dude.
ross We're still going at the game, right?
joey Yeah!
ross Yeah.
host This is contestant number sixteen, Rebecca...
phoebe Hey.
rachel Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!
phoebe We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!
rachel Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!
phoebe Oh, I know, we should have been more prepared. It's okay. Now, the way I see it, our real competition now is Cameron. Oh my God, they just took her sweater off. Look at those arms! Hello Michelin Man.
rachel Oh, Phoebe! Come on! You know what, it's already three o'clock and they haven't even gotten to Emma's group yet. We gotta go, we got dinner!
phoebe But Emma's got what it takes, she could go all the way!
rachel Phoebe, you have to calm down.
phoebe Okay. Rachel, the hottest babies in the Tri-State Area are in this room right now! I overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to Emma!
rachel Really?
phoebe Yeah!
rachel You heard them say that?
phoebe Yeah!
rachel All right, okay. Alright, let's give to these babies something to cry about!
phoebe Good! Oh yay! Let's get down to business! Emma needs some makeup!
rachel No, what?
phoebe Well, she's gonna look all washed out next to the other contestants!
rachel No Phoebe, I am not letting you put makeup on my baby!
phoebe Why not!
rachel Because I already did!
joey Oh, Bob, get off the guy!
ross Oh! What a game, huh?
joey I know, yeah.
ross I can't believe Chandler is missing this!
joey Yeah. I am sorry he's not here too, but I got to say, I am really enjoying Nacho Chair.
ross Yeah, I'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.
joey Ohhhh! These seats are great!
ross I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!
joey Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner.
ross Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal.
joey I don't know...
ross One more fight!
joey Okay.
ross Okay.
monica Where is everybody? They're forty-five minutes late!
chandler I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!
joey How late are we?
ross Forty-five minutes.
joey Wow
ross Here!
joey Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!
ross You may want to lose the foam finger!
joey Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!
ross Hey!
phoebe Oh!
joey You are not at Thanksgiving?
rachel No...
phoebe No, we're late!
rachel What are you doing here!
ross We're late too!
joey We figured we could be late because you guys were gonna be on time
phoebe Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani!
ross So, nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us!
joey Yeah, where were you!
ross Yeah, yeah, what's with the trophy!
phoebe Uh, we were at the Spelling Bee!
rachel And I won!
ross You won an adult Thanksgiving day spelling bee.
rachel Yes! Y-E-S. Yes!
ross Let me see this... Grand Supreme Little Darling, New York Division.
rachel Yeah. That's me!
ross You entered Emma into a Beauty Pageant?
phoebe And it looks like she put makeup on her!
joey Wait a second, wait a second, where have I seen that cowgirl outfit before...
ross I can't believe this, she's our daughter! That you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable!
rachel She won a thousand dollars!
ross So this is an annual thing?
joey Oh! That's Alicia Mae Emory's outfit!
phoebe You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!
ross Yeah. What are we gonna do?
rachel Well, I don't know, you guys figure it out, I got to put Emma down for a nap.
joey All right. Hey Rach, while you're in there, throw something on Alicia Mae.
phoebe Alright, what are we gonna say?
ross Ooh, we'll say that we were mugged! You can't get mad at someone who's been mugged!
phoebe Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!
joey No. Here
ross HEY!
monica Do you hear something?
chandler They're out there!
monica Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!
chandler Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says "Rangers" on it. They went to the game!
monica Oooh! They are in for a world of pain!
chandler Ross' shirt is torn.
monica Oh! They're late and they're sloppy!
rachel Alright, Emma is napping... what happened to your shirt?
ross I got mugged. And they stole my pocket.
phoebe We're just... we're trying to figure out an excuse. Hey! Ooh! How about this: We can say that Monica told us 5 o'clock, not 4 o'clock. That way we're right on time! OR... or, we can plant PCP in the apartment and call the cops on her.
ross That would be a good way to get rid of all the PCP we have lying around.
rachel You know what, we just say that she said it was 5 o'clock. We'll just act casual. We're not late, we're right on time.
ross We know you're out there.
joey Who do you think its from?
rachel Oh, God. This is bad. This is so bad.
ross Well, let's just go in there and face them.
phoebe Well, I'm not going in first. I bet that vein on Monica's forehead is popping like crazy.
joey I hate that thing, it's like a... bolt of lightning.
rachel Oh, hey, I have an idea. Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors, and whoever loses goes in first. Ready?
joey Ah-haah! I win!!
ross What is that?
joey That's fire. Beats everything.
phoebe Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?
joey Ooh! Well played, Phoebe Buffay, well played.
rachel Alright, enough, enough, come on. Let's just all go in at the same time.
all Alright, okay.
phoebe It's locked.
ross Wha...? Oh sure, now they lock it, but when they're having sex on the couch, its like: "Come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy".
rachel Alright, come on... Alright, you guys. We're so sorry we're late. Please let us in, so we can have dinner together.
monica No! Everything's cold. The turkey's dried out and the... the stuffing is all soggy.
chandler Yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that... what happens to cranberry sauce?
monica Nothing. It's fine.
chandler Oh thank God!
ross Come on you guys, we're sorry, alri...? Our subway broke down.
chandler That's a lie, you went to the game, I can see Joey's hand.
ross FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TAKE IT OFF!!
rachel You guys, come on, it doesn't matter why we're late. We're all here now, please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.
joey I had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.
monica That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
ross How are we gonna decide who gets this?
joey WATER BALLOON!
phoebe What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
rachel Oh, I just remembered. We do have something to eat. Monica put something in our oven this morning.
phoebe Oh yeah!
monica Hey, you touch that and you will be sorry.
chandler Guys, I'd listen to her. The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it.
rachel Huh... OH MY GOD IT'S BRUSSELS SPROUTS.
ross That's worse than no food.
chandler HA-HA! All you got was Monica's stinky Brussels sprouts!
monica Stinky?!
chandler Please let me stay on this side of the door.
rachel Oh, I know... I still have my old key! We can just unlock the door.
phoebe Well, I don't know if that's such a good idea. They clearly don't want to be with us.
rachel You know what? I don't want to be with them either, but it's Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.
joey Just get in there and make a face to face apology, you know? Look them in the eye. I know I can get them to forgive us.
ross I don't know...
joey I'm telling ya... I can do it.
ross Yeah, he can do it!
rachel Oh!
joey Oh! It all looks so beautiful: the turkey, the stuffing...
chandler The cranberries...?
monica Oh! Enough! A monkey could have made 'em!
joey Hey listen guys, we feel really terrible.
chandler He's doing that weird eye contact thing. Don't look at him, don't look at him!
joey Come on you guys, we want you to know we're very very sorry. Right guys?
ross I feel terrible.
phoebe_and_rachel So, so sorry.
joey Now let's not ruin this day. You worked so hard. Let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?
chandler The floating heads do make a good point.
monica Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.
rachel So bad.
ross So bad.
phoebe So bad.
monica Okay, okay. You two go get the dessert. And I'll let you in.
rachel Dessert?
monica Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick up the pies. You did remember, right?
phoebe Pies, oh, we thought you said priiiize Here!
monica Grand Supreme Little Darling?
rachel Congratulatioooons!
monica Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do.
ross Really girls, not cool.
chandler Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.
joey Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!
ross It's a day to be thankful.
joey Don't make me come up there!
monica It's too late for apologies.
joey Fine! Let's just go. I don't need your stupid dinner.
chandler That would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.
rachel Ewww, is that what that is?
joey Sorry!
phoebe Come on you guys, let's just do our own Thanksgiving.
rachel Yeah! I'll cook!
ross Yeah! Let's go out.
rachel Hey!
joey Yeah! You three have a nice Thanksgiving.
monica The three of us?
joey Yeah! You, Chan, and the vein!
joey Ha!
joey Oh-oh! I'm stuck!
monica Joey, that is not gonna work.
joey No seriously... I'm really wedged in here.
phoebe I'll pull you through.
ross Okay.
joey aaw-ahhh-aaahhh STOP! STOP! I'm worried about damaging my head.
chandler A little late for that.
joey Alright, hurry up, you gotta do something.
monica Alright, well, this does not change anything. Okay, we need to get something to grease the sides of his face.
chandler Uhm, we've got turkey grease.
monica Bring it.
joey I just wanna say that I'm sorry I referred to the vein as a seperate person...
monica Here you go!
joey Oh, that smells good!
joey Okay.
monica Okay, try it.
joey It isn't working.
monica Alright, we're gonna have to unscrew the chain.
joey Well hurry, I can't feel my ears!
chandler Can you ever feel your ears?
joey Interesting...
monica Chandler, where are your tools?
chandler Oh, I left them on my bulldozer... I don't have tools!
monica I do, but Rachel borrowed them.
rachel I lent them to Ross.
ross I gave them to Joey.
joey I left them at the park.
monica Oh!
ross I'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.
phoebe I've already stuffed a bunch of Brussel sprouts down his pants.
ross Nice!
monica Okay, I have to get that. Now when I get back, I want you and your friends to be gone. Thanksgiving is over. The Vein has spoken.
joey It's really starting to hurt.
chandler Okay, look, I'm gonna pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can. Maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out, okay? Okay, so PUSH!
phoebe Just a sec., we're kind in the middle of something here.
joey Ooh! Stop putting things down my pants!
chandler Come on guys, PUSH!
joey Yeah! Come on!
joey_and_chandler PUSH! PUSH! PUSH!
chandler My cranberries!
joey Man, I've got food all over me.
chandler Argh! I can't believe what you did. Monica's gonna kill you!
chandler Look! Look! Look what the... Look what... Look what the floating heads did!
monica I don't care.
chandler What's going on?
monica That was the adoption agency...
chandler And?
monica WE'RE GETTING A BABY!
chandler Are you serious?
monica There's a pregnant woman in Ohio, and she picked us!
rachel I'm so happy for you!
monica This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving's ass!
rachel To Monica and Chandler... and that knocked up girl in Ohio.
ross I'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.
phoebe I know. Have you considered pageanting?
monica I can't believe they called, and we're actually getting a baby.
joey Oh, I know how you feel...
rachel Really?
joey Sure. I went through the exact same thing with Alicia Mae Emory... The waiting, the wandering... Then one day... I get that call from Toys "R" Us... She was in stock!
chandler That is the exact same thing.
