chandler_bing Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done! And you said it was gonna be fun! Which it kinda is. Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!
rachel_green Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
chandler_bing That's a mailman! That's our mailman! Hi. How are ya?
rachel_green Chandler, don't worry! This doesn't make you any less of a guy! That does! What am I sitting on? I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.
chandler_bing Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?
rachel_green Hmm.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode15 OH... MY... GAWD!!
monica_geller Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?
joey_tribbiani Ohh, Nothing.
monica_geller Didn't it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?
joey_tribbiani I know what it did! Nothing.
monica_geller They wouldn't have put it there if it didn't do something! How can you not care?
joey_tribbiani Like this.
rachel_green Well, here's another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?
joey_tribbiani Sure! It flushes it.
rachel_green Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?
chandler_bing Hello!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Ah!!
rachel_green Guess who we ran into today?!
monica_geller Janice?!
chandler_bing Isn't this amazing?
monica_geller How have you been?
janice Oh well, I'm divorced.
phoebe_buffay Ohhh, wow.
janice Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.
joey_tribbiani And there it is.
janice I just came up to say, "Hi!" Hi! And you, sweetie, I'll see you tonight.
chandler_bing Okay. Bye.
janice Bye.
chandler_bing Bye.
janice Bye.
chandler_bing Bye.
janice Bye.
chandler_bing B-bye!
janice Bye-bye.
chandler_bing Bye. I can't stand the woman!
phoebe_buffay What?! I thought you were crazy about her!
chandler_bing Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personality - Well, they're all back! Y'know? And she's picked up like nine new ones!
joey_tribbiani So what are you doing bringing her here?! There's people here!
chandler_bing Don't worry about it. I'm taking care of it tonight.
rachel_green You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.
chandler_bing Well, I don't have to break up with her this time. We're not involved! I'm going to do a pre-emptive strike! I'm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. I'm tellin' ya!
emily_waltham I can't believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.
dr_ross_geller No, it's really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.
dr_ross_geller Help! Help!! Help! Help!!
emily_waltham No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
devon Hey, mate.
liam How are ya man?
dr_ross_geller Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? Help! Help!
emily_waltham So how are you? I've been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, I've been rather busy.
devon Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?
emily_waltham Oh my God. I think you're right.
liam Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.
emily_waltham Oh, Liam.
dr_ross_geller Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or something - or should I call it football?
devon We were playing rugby.
liam In fact we're playing a game at the park tomorrow. You're welcome to play too if you want.
emily_waltham Ross play rugby? I don't think so.
dr_ross_geller What's ah, what's so funny about that?
emily_waltham Well I mean, you're American to start with. You don't even have rugby here.
dr_ross_geller Well, we didn't have freedom here until 1776, either so
devon So good then! We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2
liam Cheers!
dr_ross_geller Cheers!
janice Oh boy, I just love to sing!
chandler_bing Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.
janice Oh, look at us! Who would've thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails.
chandler_bing Okay, we have to talk. I'm just getting out of a very serious relationship
janice I know! And I'm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!
chandler_bing Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.
janice Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.
chandler_bing I hear ya. But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!
janice Oh no! Where to? Too Paris?
chandler_bing No! No! Not, Paris.
janice Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?
chandler_bing Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? Yemen. That's right, yes, I'm being transferred to Yemen!
janice When?
chandler_bing I don't know exactly.
janice Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.
chandler_bing But I do know that it's some time tomorrow.
monica_geller Done?
phoebe_buffay Yep!
rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey! What's up?
monica_geller This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them don't work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
joey_tribbiani I bet I stopped listening before you did.
rachel_green Y'know, you-you also could've used uh, lamps and then followed the light.
monica_geller Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. I hear something! I hear something! Where is it?
rachel_green It's coming from Joey!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God, that's so freaky! Turn him off!!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.
dr_ross_geller Oh, just hold on a second. I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm man enough to play this sport.
joey_tribbiani Dude, you're not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.
janice Hey there Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Janice.
chandler_bing Y'know uh, you didn't really have to help me pack.
janice Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didn't really leave me much choice. Did you?
chandler_bing Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey, what's going on?
chandler_bing Oh, I'm packing. Y'know I'm-I'm packing 'cause I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Thanks for telling me!
chandler_bing I'm only going to pretend I'm moving to Yemen, it's the only way I can get rid off her.
joey_tribbiani Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.
janice Chandler! Come on, I'm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. It's a real space saver.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know, I do that 'cause it makes me look taller.
janice Okay, Chandler, come on!
chandler_bing Okay. Joey, trade lives with me!
joey_tribbiani Nope. Man look at this! Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!
dr_ross_geller Hey, I can handle it! All right?
rachel_green Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.
dr_ross_geller That's 'cause-'cause you're mom's dog kept-kept looking at me.
joey_tribbiani Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. That's called a scrum, okay? It's kinda like a huddle.
dr_ross_geller And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?
joey_tribbiani Ross! They're gonna kill you!
phoebe_buffay Well, why are you doing this anyway?
dr_ross_geller Well, you should've seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.
phoebe_buffay You're kidding! And he plays rugby?! That's so funny. Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.
dr_ross_geller Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So I'm gonna show her how tough I really am!
rachel_green I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You're right, you are a tough guy. You're the toughest palaeontologist I know.
joey_tribbiani All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! It's not like he's... Chandler!
chandler_bing Thanks!
dr_ross_geller Look, don't worry about me. Okay? I'll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. I'll uh, I'll be that guy right out of the circle.
all@ Oh!
rachel_green Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookin' at him.
joey_tribbiani Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy , and that guy . And that one - Dude! They're all huge!
dr_ross_geller They don't look any bigger than me!
joey_tribbiani Well, maybe that's because you're closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.
emily_waltham I'm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?
dr_ross_geller All right.
emily_waltham Okay.
phoebe_buffay Hi.
phoebe_buffay Whoa! I kinda liked it.
dr_ross_geller Okay, I know what I have to do. I've got to go Red Ross. Y'know, Red Ross!
joey_tribbiani I totally don't know what you're talking about.
dr_ross_geller Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!
joey_tribbiani No.
dr_ross_geller You'll see.
emily_waltham Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, it's his first time.
liam You don't say!
emily_waltham Good luck, babe.
liam Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! Ross! Come on!
liam Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!
dr_ross_geller JOEY!!!!!!
rachel_green You... are... not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?
monica_geller He asked you out?!
rachel_green No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.
monica_geller Saucy!
rachel_green What are these?
monica_geller Electrical plans for the building.
rachel_green Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?
monica_geller I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.
rachel_green Wow! If only more people knew.
chandler_bing Y'know you, really didn't have to take me to the airport.
janice Oh please. Every moment is precious. Y'know? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to care too much that you're leaving.
chandler_bing Well, we're really not that close. Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.
janice On no! No! It's not good-bye, I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.
chandler_bing Okay. Then I guess it's just, wait here then. Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.
ticket_counter_attendant One ticket to Yemen?
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.
ticket_counter_attendant I'm sorry sir, I don't understand.
chandler_bing What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?
ticket_counter_attendant Are you travelling with a child?
chandler_bing No. All right, y'know what, she's gonna think that I'm handing you a credit card, but what I'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
ticket_counter_attendant Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.
janice What's the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?
chandler_bing American Express?
emily_waltham I can't believe they're doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!
phoebe_buffay No offence but, y'know sometimes it's hard to understand you, y'know with the accent, so
emily_waltham That's just halftime, there's more of this.
dr_ross_geller Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!
emily_waltham Right.
dr_ross_geller Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?
emily_waltham Okay.
dr_ross_geller Thanks. I-I think I'm dying. I really do.
phoebe_buffay Oh, poor baby.
dr_ross_geller Tell my son that I love him. Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!
emily_waltham Ross, they are killing you out there!
dr_ross_geller That's not true!
phoebe_buffay She's right! You have to stop!
dr_ross_geller What? No! No, I'm not stopping. I'm Red Ross!
joey_tribbiani Dude, if you go back out there, you're gonna be Dead Ross!
dr_ross_geller I don't care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!
emily_waltham All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.
dr_ross_geller No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.
emily_waltham No. That's not what I'm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.
dr_ross_geller I like that.
emily_waltham Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.
dr_ross_geller Huh?
emily_waltham One swift kick and he'll back off.
dr_ross_geller All right, bad ankle, got it!
emily_waltham And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesn't wear a cup.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!
emily_waltham And uh, Liam, Liam's got bad knees. You hit him right and he'll go down like a lamp.
dr_ross_geller But-but, Liam's on my team.
emily_waltham I don't care! You just get him!
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in!
joey_tribbiani The Red Ross! Okay.
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hi!
rachel_green What-what are-what are these?
monica_geller Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought they'd brighten up the place. They do don't you think?
monica_geller No-no-no, no!
monica_geller I know that there's no hole there, I just really liked that picture.
rachel_green Oh my God! Look at this!
monica_geller Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!
rachel_green I don't care! The wires have come loose in your head!
monica_geller I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.
rachel_green And did you?!
monica_geller No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.
monica_geller But it didn't. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.
rachel_green Oh my God.
mrs_chatracus#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode15 Hello darling.
rachel_green Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.
phoebe_buffay Now, are you sure you don't want to go see a doctor?
dr_ross_geller Oh no! That-that'll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Y'know what? I'm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, it's in my pocket.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, sure.
dr_ross_geller No, not you.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, look, your eye's still popping out a little, I'm gonna go get some ice.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice!
emily_waltham You were amazing out there.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I kinda was, wasn't I?
emily_waltham Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I haven't done that since I was four and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.
emily_waltham You really enjoyed yourself didn't you?
dr_ross_geller Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody nose - I mean I-I'm not proud of it but, I really am. And it's all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.
emily_waltham I think you've got concussion.
dr_ross_geller No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.
emily_waltham You're welcome. I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?
dr_ross_geller It's worth the pain. Y'know what, you know what? It's not.
ticket_counter_attendant This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.
chandler_bing Well, I-I guess I gotta go.
janice Oh, my Bing-a-ling. I'll wait for you. Do you even know how long you're going to be gone?
chandler_bing Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.
janice Oh. Well, I'll right you everyday. 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.
chandler_bing Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.
janice Chandler?
chandler_bing No!
janice Chandler!
chandler_bing Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!
janice No! No! I wanna see you take-off.
chandler_bing Well, I then guess I'm going to Yemen! I'm going to Yemen! When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?
monica_geller All right. The super couldn't figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldn't figure out what it did. I've had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.
rachel_green Thank God.
monica_geller I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.
phoebe_buffay See? I'm doing it. I am totally doing it. I lost it.
