dr_ross_geller Hey you guys I got some bad news.
phoebe_buffay Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"
dr_ross_geller No, Monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the Post. I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around the neighborhood and bought all the copies I could find.
joey_tribbiani Man, this is bad! And I've had my share of bad reviews. I still remember my first good one though. "Everything else in this production of Our Town was simply terrible. Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey.
monica_geller Oh my God! Look at all the newspapers! It must be a good review! Is it great?!
dr_ross_geller Umm
monica_geller Oh dear God!
dr_ross_geller But the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.
monica_geller What about the rest of Manhattan?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, they all know.
monica_geller Oh my God, this is horrible!
chandler_bing I'm so sorry.
monica_geller I'm so humiliated!
rachel_green Yeah but y'know what they say Mon, "There's no such thing as bad press."
monica_geller You don't think that umm, "The chef's Mahi Mahi was awful awful," is bad press?
rachel_green I didn't write it.
monica_geller Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?
all@ No!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!
rachel_green Ross!
dr_ross_geller What?! What?
rachel_green I am freaking out!
dr_ross_geller Are ya?
rachel_green My due date is in one week!
dr_ross_geller What are you doing up?
rachel_green That is seven days!
dr_ross_geller Okay look, I had a lot of water before I went to bed. Can we do this after
rachel_green No-no-no-no-no Ross! Please, come on we do not have any of the big stuff we need! We do not a changing table! We do not have a crib! We do not have a diaper service!
dr_ross_geller It's funny you should mention diapers.
rachel_green I'm serious.
dr_ross_geller Okay look, there's nothing to worry about. We have plenty of time. There's a great baby furniture store on west 10th. Tomorrow, we will go there and we will get you everything that you need. Okay?
rachel_green Okay. Thank you. That's great. Thank you. Wait-wait! Where on west 10th? Because there's this really cute shoe store that has like this little
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay. If uh, if you're gonna do this, then I'm gonna do that. So
rachel_green Oh, wait Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
rachel_green Umm, our situation. Y'know umm, what we mean to each other. And I mean we-we're having this baby together, and we live together. Isn't that, isn't that weird?
dr_ross_geller Well uh
rachel_green I'm just kidding! You can go pee!
joey_tribbiani Hey uh Monica, I can't remember. Did we say we were gonna meet here or at the movies?
monica_geller We said at the movies, but
joey_tribbiani Okay, I'll see you there.
monica_geller Joey! Now that you're here
joey_tribbiani Sure, I can hang out 'til I have to meet ya. What uh-How come you're not going?
chandler_bing I have a job interview I have to get ready for.
joey_tribbiani I thought you already have a job.
chandler_bing And people say you don't pay attention. No, this is a much better job. It's vice-president of a company that does data reconfiguration and statistical factoring for other companies.
joey_tribbiani Wow! How do you know how to do that?!
chandler_bing That's what I do now.
monica_geller Hey Joey, come taste this.
joey_tribbiani What is it?
monica_geller Remember that guy that gave me a bad review? Well... I'm getting my revenge!
joey_tribbiani You cooked him?
monica_geller No. He teaches a course on food criticism at the New School, so before we go to the movies I wanna go by there and make him try my bouillabaisse again. Oh, I cannot wait to read the front page of the Post tomorrow! "Restaurant reviewer admits: I was wrong about Monica."
chandler_bing The front page? You really do live in your own little world, don't ya?
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Do you uh, want these things delivered Mr. and Mrs. Geller?
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
rachel_green No-no-no! No, no, no, we're not married.
dr_ross_geller We are having a baby together, but we're not involved. I mean, uh we-we were seeing each other a while ago, but then we were just friends. And then there was one drunken night. Or, yes stranger, we'd like this delivered please.
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Why don't you fill out this address card.
dr_ross_geller Oh, okay.
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 I notice you picked out a lot of our dinosaur items.
rachel_green Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.
dr_ross_geller I chose those, I'm a paleontologist.
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Really?! That is so cool!
rachel_green Oh. Oh yeah, don't get to worked up over it. I mean it-it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Oh no-no, I'm fascinated by paleontology. Have you read the new Walter Alvarez book?
dr_ross_geller Yeah! I-I teach it in my class.
rachel_green Oh my God! I'm standing at a cash register, holding a credit card, and I'm bored.
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Oh, I love your neighborhood. There's a great gym right around the corner from your building.
dr_ross_geller That's my gym.
cashier#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 I can tell you work out. A paleontologist who works out, you're like Indiana Jones.
dr_ross_geller I am like Indiana Jones.
rachel_green Hi Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?
rachel_green Oh, it was great! We got everything that we needed! Oh and Ross, almost got something that wasn't on the list. A whore.
phoebe_buffay What?!
rachel_green Well, we were paying for our stuff and this saleswoman just started flirting with him.
phoebe_buffay Well did she know you two weren't married?
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! Well the idea of a woman flirting with a-with a single man, we-we must alert the church elders!
rachel_green You don't understand! You didn't see how brazen she was.
phoebe_buffay Sounds like you're a little jealous.
rachel_green No! I'm not! I-I-I just think it's wrong! It's-it's that I'm-Here I am about to pop and he's out picking up some shop girl at Sluts 'R' Us!
phoebe_buffay Is that a real place? Are they hiring?
chandler_bing Hey Phoebe! Fatty!
phoebe_buffay Hey Chandler, why so fancy?
chandler_bing Well, I got a job interview. It's kinda a big deal too. Its a lot more money and I'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.
phoebe_buffay Wait, I think I know someone who does that.
chandler_bing Me! I do that. So... Seriously, do I look okay? I'm little nervous.
rachel_green Oh yeah! You really-You look great.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, just don't get your hopes up.
chandler_bing Why not?
phoebe_buffay Well, the interview
chandler_bing What about it?
phoebe_buffay Y'know! You don't make a very good first impression.
chandler_bing What?!
phoebe_buffay Oh you don't know.
chandler_bing Are you serious?!
phoebe_buffay Yes, when I first met you, you were like, "Blah, blah, blah." I was like, shhh!
chandler_bing What is it that I do?
phoebe_buffay Well it's just like you're trying too hard. Always making jokes, y'know, you just-You come off a little needy.
chandler_bing Did you like me when we first met?
rachel_green Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to ya, but I am gonna run away from you.
monica_geller Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.
the_food_critic Still?
monica_geller I think the things that you said about me are really unfair, and I would like for you to give my bouillabaisse another chance.
the_food_critic I don't see any reason why I would do that to myself again.
joey_tribbiani Either eat it, or be in it.
monica_geller Spoon? So, what do you think?
the_food_critic I'm torn, between my integrity and my desire to avoid a beating. But I must be honest, your soap is abysmal.
joey_tribbiani Thata girl! Huh? We should get out of here; there's a new class comin' in.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Welcome to introduction to cooking. Now, before we start, can anyone tell me the difference between a hollandaise sauce and a bearnaise sauce?
monica_geller I can.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Okay, go ahead.
monica_geller Well umm, they both have a egg yolk and butter base, but a bearnaise has shallots, shirvel, and most importantly tarragon.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 That's very good, what's your name?
monica_geller Monica.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Monica, you go to the head of the class.
monica_geller Okay.
rachel_green All this stuff takes up a lot of room. Hey how uh, how serious are you about keeping Ben in your life?
dr_ross_geller My son? Pretty serious. Oh hey Katie! What uh, what are you doing here?
katie Well, the delivery went out to you and I realized they forgot this.
dr_ross_geller Ah, must've been fairly obvious since it was the only thing left in your store.
katie Listen, to be honest, home deliveries are really a part of my job description.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
katie Oh uh...I actually came here to ask you out.
dr_ross_geller Oh! Wow! Uh, yeah! That sounds great. I'm just gonna put this back in my pocket, pretend that didn't happen. Uh yeah, actually I'm free now. Do you wanna grab some coffee or
katie Sure!
rachel_green Horny bitch. No! You're a horny bitch! Noooo! You're the horny bitch! No! You're a horny bitch!
rachel_green So you guys go, have a really good time.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I'm just gonna grab my coat. And uh, and my whip. Y'know because of the Indiana Jones? Not-not because I'm-I'm into S&M. I'm not-I'm not into anything weird. Y'know? Just-just normal sex. So, I'm gonna grab my coat.
rachel_green So, you had a good day huh? Big commission; picked up a daddy.
katie Are you okay with this?
rachel_green Oh yeah! Yeah please, you guys have fun.
katie Okay. It was nice to see you.
rachel_green Oh and it was great to see you too. And you look fantastic, although you missed a button.
katie Oh umm, actually I umm
rachel_green Oh okay, I see what you're doing there.
chandler_bing I can't even believe this! I really come off that badly?
phoebe_buffay Oh! It's okay, you calm down after a while and then people can see how really sweet and wonderful you really are.
chandler_bing Oh good. Good, because I'm sure this interview is gonna last a couple of weeks.
phoebe_buffay All right, don't freak out! Okay? I-I will help you. How long before you have to leave?
chandler_bing An hour.
phoebe_buffay I can't help you.
chandler_bing Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay All right, all right, we'll just do our best. Okay? So let's say I'm the interviewer and I'm meeting you for the first time. Okay. "Hi! Come on in, I'm uh, Regina Philange."
chandler_bing Chandler Bing.
phoebe_buffay Bing, what an unusual name.
chandler_bing Well you should meet my uncle, Bada. I'll let myself out.
joey_tribbiani Hi.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Your Fettuccini Alfredo looks a little dry, did you use all your cheese?
joey_tribbiani When you say used, do you mean eat as a pre-cooking snack?
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 And the cream?
joey_tribbiani Cheese makes me thirsty.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Okay. Let's move on.
joey_tribbiani All right.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Oh! Something smells good over at Monica's station! Oh my God! This is absolutely amazing! You've never made this before?
monica_geller Oh no! I don't know anything about cooking. I had to ask someone what it's called when the, when the water makes those little bubbles.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Well, hats off to the chef.
monica_geller I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 The chef!
monica_geller That's right.
chandler_bing ...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.
phoebe_buffay Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.
chandler_bing What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.
phoebe_buffay I see. Nice sidestep on the do do thing by the way.
chandler_bing Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
phoebe_buffay You gotta go!
chandler_bing Oh!
phoebe_buffay Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
chandler_bing Really?
phoebe_buffay Absolutely! Just fight all your natural instincts and you'll be great.
chandler_bing Okay.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Ah Monica, my star student.
monica_geller Y'know, you called me that before so I-I took the liberty of fashioning a star out of aluminum foil. Now, no pressure, you like my cookies, you give me the star.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Oh, yum-yum-yum.
monica_geller Wow! A star! I know you all hate me and-and I'm sorry, but I don't care.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Okay Joey, you're up next. This are good! This is amazing! You get an A!
joey_tribbiani I can an A? In-in school? Hey, I'm a dork.
monica_geller Joey! I'm so proud of you!
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 I think you should give him your star.
monica_geller Excuse me? He doesn't even know what he's doing!
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 We're all beginners here. Nobody knows what they're doing.
monica_geller I do! I'm a professional chef! Oh relax! It's not a courtroom drama!
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 If you're a professional chef, what are you doing taking Introduction to Cooking?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
monica_geller I'm-I'm sorry, it's just that umm... Well I-I cook at this restaurant, Alessandro's, and umm I just got a really bad review
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Oh Alessandro's! I love that place!
monica_geller You do?
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Oh yes! You're an excellent chef! As a person you're a little
monica_geller Oh, I'm totally crazy, but you-you like the food?
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Very much.
monica_geller Okay then, I don't stink. I'm a good chef. Okay.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! I don't want to go. I'm having fun.
the_cooking_teacher#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Well actually, did either of you pay for this class?
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey-hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go.
chandler_bing ...also I was the point person on my company's transition from the KL-5 to GR-6 system.
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 You must've had your hands full.
chandler_bing That I did. That I did.
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 So let's talk a little bit about your duties.
chandler_bing My duties? All right.
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Now you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.
chandler_bing I see.
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 But there'll be perhaps 30 people under you so you can dump a certain amount on them.
chandler_bing Good to know.
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 We can go into detail
chandler_bing No don't I beg of you!
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 All right then, we'll have a definite answer for you on Monday, but I think I can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.
chandler_bing Really?!
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Absolutely. You can relax; you did great.
chandler_bing Yeah I gotta say thank you, I was really nervous. Y'know I've been told I come on to strong, make to many jokes, and then it was really hard to sidestep that duty thing. Duties. Duties! Poo.
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Poo?
chandler_bing Oh my God this doesn't count! Okay? The interview was over, that was the real Chandler Bing in there, this is just some crazy guy out in the hall! Call security! There's a crazy guy out in the hall!
the_interviewer#unknown#Friends.Season08.Episode21 Poo?!
chandler_bing I'll look forward to your call.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hi! You're back from your date!
dr_ross_geller How are you?
rachel_green I'm fine, but that's not important. What's important is how was she?
dr_ross_geller Uhh, it was fun. We, we just had coffee.
rachel_green Oh uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table.
dr_ross_geller What's uh, what's going on? Do you not, do you not like Katie?
rachel_green No! No, she's-She was nice. I mean, she's a little slutty, but who isn't?
dr_ross_geller I liked her.
rachel_green Of course you did Ross, you would date a gorilla if it called you Indiana Jones!
dr_ross_geller Did you get like a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?!
rachel_green No! It's just that, Kate bothered me.
dr_ross_geller Why? What was wrong with her?
rachel_green There was nothing wrong with her! All right? She was perfectly lovely!
dr_ross_geller Okay, so what's the matter?
rachel_green I don't want you to date her!
dr_ross_geller Why? What, what are you jealous?
rachel_green Yes! And not because I want you to go out with me, but because I don't want you to go out with anybody! Okay? I know it's a terrible thing to even think this, and it's completely inappropriate, but I want you to be at my constant beck and call 24 hours a day! I'm very sorry, but that is just the way that I feel.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller I won't date. I'll uh, I'll be here, with you, all the time.
rachel_green Really? But I'm being so unreasonable.
dr_ross_geller True, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. You're having our baby.
rachel_green Oh Ross, thank you. Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Do you feel better?
rachel_green No, not really. You're pressing the baby into my bladder and now I have to pee. Sorry.
dr_ross_geller Uh Rach?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Just one thing umm
rachel_green Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller We live together. You're having our baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else. Are you-are you sure you don't want something more?
rachel_green Wow! I don't know, maybe. I'm
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, Rach! I was just messin' around! Like you did last night when I had to pee?
rachel_green I knew that! I knew that! I was just messin' with you too!
dr_ross_geller Okay. Okay. Because for a minute you said you
rachel_green Oh no-no-no-no, no!
dr_ross_geller ...that you actually
rachel_green No that's just--That's just 'cause I'm such a good messer!
dr_ross_geller Rach?
rachel_green Yeah?
dr_ross_geller The bathroom?
rachel_green Right!
joey_tribbiani Well I had a great time! Learned how to bake, ate great food, that's the first A I've gotten since seventh grade, and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher this time.
monica_geller Oh, look! Acting for Beginners! Want to feel good about yourself?
joey_tribbiani What the hell!
monica_geller Okay.
the_acting_teacher All right, let's start with some basics. Can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
