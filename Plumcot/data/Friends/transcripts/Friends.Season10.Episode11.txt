monica_geller Or "Win, Lose or Draw".
chandler_bing What did I marry into?
joey_tribbiani Would you guys want to come down tomorrow and watch me tape the show?
monica_geller Oh, I can't. We're throwing Phoebe a bachelorette party.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, sorry boys, this ride's closing.
dr_ross_geller Oh, and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing. I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond.
joey_tribbiani Seriously?
dr_ross_geller Yeah-uh!
monica_geller Ross and I always wanted to be Donny and Marie.
chandler_bing You guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!
monica_geller Yeah, we used to perform for our family and friends.
rachel_green Oh God, that's right. I blocked that out.
monica_geller "I'm a little bit country"...
dr_ross_geller "...and I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll"!
chandler_bing I'm leaving you.
dr_ross_geller So weird to see all these people again... Oh my God, look, there's Geoffrey Cleric.
chandler_bing Who?
dr_ross_geller He was roommates with John Rosoff. He went out with Andrea Tamburino. She dumped him for Michael Skloff.
chandler_bing Did I go to this school?
dr_ross_geller Hey, there's Missy Goldberg. You gotta remember her.
chandler_bing Sure, nice.
dr_ross_geller Dude. You're married to my sister.
chandler_bing You're right, by saying "nice" I'm virtually licking her.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I hear she's single again, d'you think I should ask her out?
chandler_bing Are you asking permission to break the pact?
dr_ross_geller Yes please.
dr_ross_geller Hey. Hey, check out the flyers for the band. I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room!
chandler_bing Awesome, the name really stands out.
dr_ross_geller Thanks to a little something called "Helvetica Bold 24 point"!
chandler_bing Man, we're gonna rock that Asian student union!
missy_goldberg Hey guys!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Hey, Missy...
chandler_bing You know, our band is playing on Friday.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah. You should come check us out. We're called "Way! No Way!".

dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Way!
missy_goldberg Right. I'll be there.
chandler_bing Fresh!
dr_ross_geller Boss!
chandler_bing Mint!
dr_ross_geller She's gone.
chandler_bing I know it. You know, I'm totally gonna ask her out.
dr_ross_geller Dude, I was gonna ask her out.
chandler_bing I said it first, bro.
dr_ross_geller Well, I thought it first, Holmes.
chandler_bing Look, if you did...
dr_ross_geller Woha! Wait... What are we doing? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl. I mean, we can get laid anytime we want.
chandler_bing Totally. I had sex in High school...
dr_ross_geller Me too. I'm good at it.
chandler_bing All right, I'd say we make a pact. Neither of us will go out with Missy Goldberg.
dr_ross_geller You got it.
chandler_bing All right, so that's Missy Goldberg, Phoebe Cates and Molly Ringwald, who neither of us can go out with.
dr_ross_geller Those are the pacts!
chandler_bing Oh, and Sheena Easton. But we probably couldn't get her anyway.
dr_ross_geller Oh, oh... maybe not you!
chandler_bing Well, I officially give you permission to break the pact.
dr_ross_geller Thank you. All right, here I go. Hey, remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college?
chandler_bing Your hands are shaking.
dr_ross_geller I know, and I can't stop sweating.

rachel_green Pheebs, I... there isn't gonna be any flying about! We actually thought we were a little too mature for stuff like that.
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok. I see what you're doing, that's fine. This is all there is, just tea, uh, ok. Hmmmm... raunchy!
rachel_green Seriously Pheebs, it's not gonna be that kind of a party.

dr_ross_geller So, Saturday night!
missy_goldberg I'd love to!
dr_ross_geller Great!
missy_goldberg So how come it took you so long to ask me out?
dr_ross_geller Oh, well, uh, this is gonna sound kinda silly, but, do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing?
missy_goldberg Sure, he was in your "band"?
dr_ross_geller It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt.
missy_goldberg Sorry.
dr_ross_geller That's ok. Uh, anyway, well he and I both really liked you a lot, uhm, but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship, so we kinda made a pact, that neither of us could ask you out!
missy_goldberg Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, why?
missy_goldberg Well, Chandler and I used to make out! A lot!
dr_ross_geller You did?
missy_goldberg Yeah. We'd go to the science lab after hours!
dr_ross_geller AND ON MY TURF?
monica_geller Hey, where is this guy, it's been over an hour!
rachel_green Well, he's coming from Jersey, he said he would get here as fast as he could!

rachel_green Uh! The police!
phoebe_buffay Oh!
man#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode11 That's right, it's officer Goodbody.
monica_geller What's the matter, officer? Has someone been bad?
roy_the_stripper Whoo, that's a lot of stairs!
roy_the_stripper Ooh, boy. You should warn people there's no elevator! I should not have had that Mexican food for lunch.
monica_geller Are you gonna be ok, officer, uhm,...
roy_the_stripper Goodbody!
monica_geller ..If-you-say-so.
roy_the_stripper So where's the young lady who I'm supposed to take downtown!
phoebe_buffay Oh, God!
roy_the_stripper All right, somebody show me where to plug in my box, and we'll get this party started! Whaaaa... Here? All right.
phoebe_buffay Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah?
phoebe_buffay Are you kidding?
rachel_green All right, look, we did not know that you wanted a stripper so we went to the phonebook and we got the first name we could find!
phoebe_buffay How old is your phonebook?
monica_geller Oh my God, this man is gonna get naked in my apartment!
phoebe_buffay Oh God no, I don't wanna see him take his clothes off!
roy_the_stripper Are you talking about me?
monica_geller Oh, no! I mean, obviously we want to see you take your clothes off! You big piece of eye candy!
roy_the_stripper Ok, ok, ladies! Can I have your attention, please? Did someone call for the long arm of the law? I should warn you, I have a concealed weapon! I hope you're familiar with the States penal code, ok, ok, enough teasing. Now for some pleasing!
roy_the_stripper Whoa, whoa, whoa She cringed!
phoebe_buffay This is how I look when I'm turned on!
roy_the_stripper You were talking about me before! Look, I don't need this! I'm outta here! Where's my hat? Look, I've been in this business for a long time!
phoebe_buffay Shocking!
roy_the_stripper Now if you just pay me my three hundred dollars, I'll be on my way!
phoebe_buffay Three hundred dollars, are you kidding?
rachel_green No, that's ok, let's me just get my check book!
phoebe_buffay No, you're not gonna pay him, he didn't do anything!
roy_the_stripper Didn't do anything? I took a bus all the way from Hoboken. I climbed.. I dunno... like a billion stairs... It's not like I can take them two at a time!
phoebe_buffay I don't care. We're not paying you 300 dollars for this.
roy_the_stripper Well, look - it's not my fault if you're too uptight to appreciate the male form in all it's glory.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, okay. I'm uptight. Yeah, that's why I don't want to watch a middle aged guy dance around in what I can only assume is a child halloween costume!
roy_the_stripper I may have borrowed this from my nephew, but let me assure you, what's underneath.. is all man.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, did you say all man or old man?
roy_the_stripper Oh, you're mean!
monica_geller Uh, look, officer... uhm Sir...
roy_the_stripper Damnit. OH! Big surprise! The hunk of beef has feelings!
donny_osmond Ok Henrietta, you've picked Jack and Jill went up the hill.

donny_osmond Joey describe these things associated with the United States congress. Give me 20 seconds on the clock please. Ready? Go!
joey_tribbiani Oh,. uh... uh... pass. Pass. Pass. Okay, the little thing that hangs down at the back of your throat.
henrietta Uvula!
joey_tribbiani Oh, then pass.
donny_osmond O-kay... Henrietta, you didn't get all the points you needed, so that means Gene, you are going to the winners circle to try for ten thousand dollars! And you're gonna be going there with Joey Tribbiani
dr_ross_geller You made out with Missy Goldberg. How could you do that, after you promised me?
chandler_bing Excuse me. That didn't make us sound gay at all!
dr_ross_geller You broke the pact!
chandler_bing Ross, that was 16 years ago!
dr_ross_geller That doesn't matter! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship.
chandler_bing I believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair. All right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.
dr_ross_geller I didn't.
chandler_bing Oh really?
dr_ross_geller No.
chandler_bing Oh really!?
dr_ross_geller NO!
chandler_bing ADRIENNE TURNER!!
adrienne_turner Yes?
dr_ross_geller@chandler_bing Hey! Hey Adrienne.
dr_ross_geller I never did anything with Adrienne Turner.
chandler_bing Oh please, and you knew how much I liked her.
dr_ross_geller I don't know what... you're talking about.
chandler_bing Really?
present_chandlers_voice#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode11 Remember that big party? Freshman year? A week before Christmas vacation? I do. You had some visitors.
monica_geller I can't believe we are at a real college party! I have to pee so bad!
rachel_green This is so awesome! College guys are so cute!
monica_geller Hey, you've got a boyfriend!
rachel_green I know. But if some guy who looks like Corey Haim wants to kiss me tonight, I'm sooo gonna let them!
monica_geller Look, there's Chandler. You knew, that stupid friend of Ross'. Said I'm fat. You know I've already lost 4 pounds!
rachel_green It... You can so totally tell.
monica_geller I KNOW!
rachel_green Well lets see. Maybe he knows where Ross is. Hey, how's it going
chandler_bing Aren't you...?
rachel_green Yeah, Rachel. And this is Ross' sister, Monica. We met at Thanksgiving.
chandler_bing Right. So how're you doing?
rachel_green Bitchin'
chandler_bing Hi Monica.
monica_geller Hi Chandler. It's really nice to see you NOT.
chandler_bing O-kay. I'll see if I can find Ross.
monica_geller Oh my God Rach. Bean bag chairs.
rachel_green Oh.
monica_geller Do NOT let me sit in one of those. We'll be here for days.
dr_ross_geller Listen Adrienne, you can't tell Chandler about this.
adrienne_turner Oh believe me, Ross, I won't be telling anybody about this.
dr_ross_geller Cool!
dr_ross_geller I didn't know you knew about that.
chandler_bing Well, I did and it hurt. That's when I wrote the song: "Betrayal In The Common Room".
dr_ross_geller Man... I... I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Look it was a lo-o-ong time ago.
dr_ross_geller So, eh. I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy. Well I guess we're even.
chandler_bing Hmm mmmhm..
dr_ross_geller We are even, right?
chandler_bing Just one more thing. I was so pissed at you that night that I wanted to get back at you. So I thought, who does Ross like the more than anybody?
dr_ross_geller What did you do to my mom?
chandler_bing Not her!
rachel_green I am sooo drunk.
monica_geller That's weird. I've had the same number of beers as you and I don't feel anything at all.
chandler_bing Soo... you girls having fun?
monica_geller For your information, ass munch, I've lost four pounds. Maybe even five with all the dancing.
pizza_guy#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode11 SOMEBODY ORDER A PIZZA?
monica_geller Oh THATS ME!
rachel_green I am soo not going to do good on my SATs tomorrow.
chandler_bing Well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.
rachel_green Oh yeah. There is a plan! Why don't I just start taking my smart pills now?
chandler_bing Well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.
rachel_green Oh, what a line.
chandler_bing So where are you applying to?
rachel_green Oh well, You know, I think it's kinda really important that I go somewhere where there's sun, so I'm sort of... Hey!
chandler_bing I'm in college and I'm in a band.
rachel_green Yeah okay.
roy_the_stripper What's the matter? You never saw a 50 year old stripper cry before?
phoebe_buffay You know, it's fine. We'll pay you.
roy_the_stripper No, no, you're right. Who am I kidding? I should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago. What am I gonna do? I mean, this has been my life for thirty two years. Taking my clothes off in front of people is all I know.
rachel_green No, wait. No there's gotta be something else that you can do. I mean, what skills do you have?
roy_the_stripper I don't know... I can make my pecs dance... I can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks... I can go to that special place inside me where I feel no shame.
rachel_green So maybe something in an office.
phoebe_buffay Or you could teach stripping. You know, share your gift, pass the torch.
roy_the_stripper You know, actually that's not a bad idea. I can do it out of my apartment. I don't think my mom would mind.
phoebe_buffay There you go. Okay, do you think you're gonna be okay?
roy_the_stripper Yeah, yeah, yeah... This is so weird. I mean, you never know when it's gonna be your last dance. And I didn't even get a chance to finish it.
phoebe_buffay Finish it!
roy_the_stripper What?
phoebe_buffay Your last dance. Do it for us.
roy_the_stripper Really?
rachel_green Really?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah. He deserves to do the thing he loves one last time.
roy_the_stripper Okay, all right... Get ready ladies!
phoebe_buffay Oh this is so ho-o-ot!
phoebe_buffay Oh no, no, no, don't stop!

monica_geller She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.
dr_ross_geller Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?
monica_geller What? When was this?
dr_ross_geller Nineteen Eighty Seven. The weekend you guys visited me at school.
monica_geller Oh my God! That's wild!
chandler_bing Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.
dr_ross_geller Well, it matters to me.
chandler_bing Why?
dr_ross_geller Because... the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time.
chandler_bing You kissed her that night too?
monica_geller Two guys in one night? Wow, I thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed.
chandler_bing Seriously, where did this happen?
dr_ross_geller Okay, after you told me she was passed out in our room, I went in there to make sure she was all right. She was lying on my bed, all buried in peoples coats. Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead, you know. But it was so dark, I accidentally got her lips. I started to pull away, but then I felt her start to kiss me back. It was only for a second, but... it was amazing. And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.
chandler_bing Oh wait... What bed did you say she was on?
dr_ross_geller Mine.
chandler_bing I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.
dr_ross_geller No, she was definitely on my bed.
chandler_bing Why would I kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?
dr_ross_geller Well, then who was on my bed?
monica_geller OH! Oh, oh!
dr_ross_geller NO! No, no!
monica_geller YES!
dr_ross_geller You were under the pile of coats?
monica_geller I was the pile of coats!
dr_ross_geller OH MY GOD!
monica_geller You were my Midnight Mystery Kisser?
dr_ross_geller You were my first kiss with Rachel?
monica_geller You were my first kiss ever?
chandler_bing What did I marry into?
monica_geller Oh, crap!
