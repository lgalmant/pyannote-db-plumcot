ross Man, I sure miss Julie.
chandler Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there.
ross You ever figure out what that thing's for?
chandler No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.
jade Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?
chandler What?
jade I got a little drunk...and naked.
chandler Bob here.
chandler What've you been up to?
jade Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.
chandler Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love her.
ross I know.
chandler I'm back.
jade So, are we gonna get together or what?
chandler Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?
jade Great, I'll see you then.
chandler Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
ross Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob."
chandler I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.
ross Oh my god. You are pure evil.
chandler Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.
ross Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.
all Hi, Julie!
rachel Hi, Julie.
chandler Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.
phoebe Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?
chandler Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.
joey Do we need a cake?
chandler Look guys, I know it's a little steep.
rachel Yeah, whoosh!
chandler But it's Ross.
phoebe It's Ross.
joey All right.
chandler I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.
ross Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?
chandler You know, I think I might just.
rachel So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?
joey Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.
phoebe Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
rachel Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?
joey Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.
phoebe Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.
joey For Ross.
rachel For Ross, Ross, Ross.
monica Oh my god.
rachel Hey.
joey Hi.
rachel What?
monica I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.
joey If it's not you, this is a horrible story.
monica Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.
joey Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney?
ross I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
chandler Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.
ross That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.
chandler We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.
ross Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
chandler All right.
ross Go.
chandler Hi.
jade Hi.
chandler Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.
jade Yes?
chandler Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
jade How did you--?
chandler I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?
jade Thanks.
chandler No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.
ross Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--
monica Who is also in charge of purchasing.
ross Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
monica Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
ross Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--
monica Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!
joey Cool.
phoebe Let's see!
ross That's fine, I'll just wait!
monica Oh, sorry.
joey Sorry, sorry.
ross Monica!
waiter Are we ready to order?
rachel Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.
waiter Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.
phoebe Wow, look at these prices.
rachel Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.
joey What are these, like famous chickens?
chandler Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?
ross Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?
chandler Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.
ross Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?
waiter Do I dare ask?
monica Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.
ross That sounds great. Same for me.
waiter And for the gentleman?
joey Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?
waiter You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?
rachel Ok, I will have the uh, side salad.
waiter And what will that be on the side of?
rachel Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?
waiter And for you?
phoebe Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.
chandler I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.
waiter Anything else?
chandler Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?
ross Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.
rachel Um, everyone?
ross Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.
joey Thank you.
ross Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.
monica Oh, thank you!
ross So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.
phoebe No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.
chandler Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.
phoebe I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...
ross Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.
phoebe Not for you.
monica All right, what's goin' on?
rachel Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.
phoebe Fine. All right, fine.
joey Yeah.
chandler You can tell us.
ross Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.
joey Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.
monica Ok.
ross I hear ya.
chandler We can talk about that.
phoebe Well, then...Let's.
ross I, I just never think of money as an issue.
rachel That's 'cause you have it.
ross That's a good point.
chandler So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?
joey 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.
ross Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?
rachel Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.
monica If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.
ross G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
chandler No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.
ross Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.
phoebe No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.
ross No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.
monica All of us.
chandler Together.
ross Not at the concert.
rachel Ok.
joey Yeah.
rachel Thank you.
joey Thanks.
phoebe Yeah.
chandler So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?
chandler Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?
monica I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.
phoebe Oh, it's like a skit.
monica Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.
ross Whoo!
phoebe Cool.
monica Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.
ross But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?
chandler By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.
ross Come on.
chandler Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!
monica It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.
phoebe So...Thank you.
ross Could you be less enthused?
joey Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--
monica Like?
joey Charity.
monica Charity?
ross We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
rachel Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.
phoebe Actually, it makes us feel that big.
ross I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.
chandler If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.
joey Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.
rachel Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.
phoebe I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.
rachel Me neither.
joey Me too.
monica Guys, we bought the tickets.
phoebe Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.
chandler Why did you look at me when you said that?
monica Well, I guess now we can't go.
rachel What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?
monica You know what? You're right.
phoebe Fine.
ross Fine.
joey Fine.
chandler Fine.
rachel Fine.
monica All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
ross Chandler!
chandler Yeah?
ross Geez! Are you ready?
chandler Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
ross Whoa! You had sex today?
chandler Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.
ross Wow.
chandler Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.
ross Still doing the screening thing?
chandler I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
machine Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
jade Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.
chandler Bob here.
jade Oh, hi.
chandler So, uh, you met someone, huh?
jade Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.
chandler So, uh, how was he?
jade Eh.
chandler Eh?
jade Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.
chandler Well, that makes me feel so good.
jade It was just so awkward and bumpy.
ross Bumpy?
chandler Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.
jade Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?
monica You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
ross Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.
chandler So, let's go.
ross Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.
chandler Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.
monica You know, the guys are probably having a great time.
joey Come on you guys, one more time.
phoebe Ok. One.
joey Nooo.
monica That was amazing!
ross Excellent, that was excellent.
chandler I can't believe the guys missed this.
ross What guys? Oh, yeah.
steve Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?
monica Do I know you?
steve You used to be my babysitter.
monica Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?
steve Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.
monica You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
steve Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.
monica Uh, wait, backstage?
steve Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.
ross Ross.
chandler Chandler.
steve How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?
ross Hey, you guys.
rachel Happy birthday.
ross Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?
rachel Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?
monica Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?
rachel Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?
monica Uh, good.
ross Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.
chandler Yeah, we really missed you guys.
joey Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.
phoebe We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?
monica No, I just, I fell down.
rachel On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
monica You know, a party, or--
rachel What party?
ross It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.
joey You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
chandler Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.
rachel Who gave you that hickey?
monica That would be the work of a Blowfish.
rachel Oh!
phoebe Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".
ross Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.
rachel What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?
monica It's work.
chandler I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
joey And we don't work hard?
monica Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.
chandler I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
joey And you feel like we hold you back.
chandler Yes.
rachel Oh!
chandler No.
monica Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.
phoebe Oh.
waitress Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
joey Let me get that. You got five bucks?
machine Here comes the beep, you know what to do.
jade Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night...
