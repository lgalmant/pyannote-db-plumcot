chandler Hey!
ross Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?
chandler Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do..I mean come on!!
ross OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?
chandler No!
ross OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.
chandler Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said"No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there." And I said "Maybe if we put some light out there they will"
ross Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !
chandler So are you gonna...talk to her?
ross Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!
chandler You know when "That's fine" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!
ross No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!
chandler No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?
ross I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.
chandler Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!
ross Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.
chandler Why did I get married?!
joey Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?
phoebe Well it depends.
joey On...?
phoebe On how far along he's in the sex change process!
monica No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...
joey Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!
phoebe Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...
joey Oh man! I have to get those done too?!
phoebe Wow! Talking about high maintenance
joey Hey hey! You dye your hair!
phoebe I'm a woman!
joey Arghhh! Double standards!
phoebe Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?
monica Only if I don't have to get up and sing.
phoebe But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.
monica It's just, I'm not good at singing.
phoebe Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?
monica No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!
phoebe OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.
monica So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?
phoebe While drinking...
monica I'm there!
rachel Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.
phoebe Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there
rachel No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.
phoebe Oh my god.
monica You kissed him?
rachel Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...
monica Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?
phoebe It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.
monica Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?
rachel You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...
monica I thought you hated him?
rachel You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!
monica So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?
rachel I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.
monica Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross
rachel Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...
phoebe Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!
salon_girl Hi
joey Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.
salon_girl Name?
joey Chandler Bing.
salon_girl Ok. Very good. Have a seat right over here Mr. Bing and Sonia will be right with you.
joey OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff
sonia I'll take care of it
joey Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?
sonia Oh absolutely.
joey Oh good...
sonia Are you looking to meet somebody?
joey All right let's just do this.
sonia We'll get to the wax in a minute. First I want to tweeze some of the strays, ok? This may sting just a little bit...
joey Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!
chandler Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?
ross Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.
chandler Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....
ross That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?
chandler What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!
ross I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me
chandler Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing
ross No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.
chandler Did she go out with him?
ross No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.
chandler Ah! The high road...
ross You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!
chandler Are you trying to get everybody divorced?
ross You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...
chandler I thought I had to make the jokes!
ross Don't you have to be at work?
chandler Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!
ross Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: "Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?"
blonde_girl Sorry...we were just leaving
chandler We still got it!
rachel Who is it?
gavin Gavin! I brought you some soup.
rachel Why?
gavin I heard you were sick...
rachel Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin
gavin I missed you at work today. How are you feeling?
rachel I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick
gavin Oh! Good! Because I was having a totally paranoid moment when I thought you called in sick to avoid me.
rachel Oh no no no
gavin So I had fun last night
rachel So did I
gavin Exactly how contagious is this thing you have? I mean is it a cold for standing on the balcony or did a monkey bite you?
rachel It's just a cold
gavin Do you have fever? Let me see. Hum...
rachel What? What's the matter?
gavin What's Ross doing to you on that picture?
rachel Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.
gavin Right. Right. Ross. So what's the deal with you guys? I don't want to get in the middle of anything
rachel Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!
gavin Yeah! But you said not to worry about...
rachel I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!
molly Hi!
rachel Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.
molly No I'm here to take Emma to your mother's, remember?
rachel Right, right, yes!
molly Don't panic!
rachel What?
molly There is a man behind your curtain. I have a mace in my purse.
rachel No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!
gavin Hi! Gavin! Please to meet you. It was my idea to stand there.
molly Hello! I just go and get Emma.
rachel OK.
gavin So hum...Why did I have to hide?
rachel I thought it was Ross.
gavin So what if it was? I thought there was nothing going on between you two...
rachel There isn't. There is totally isn't.
gavin You hear a key in the hole and you jump like a young bronco coming out of a chute for the first time. I used to be arodeo clown.
rachel All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.
gavin It's OK. I know it's probably not my place but can I give you a piece of advice?
rachel Yes
gavin I think you should talk to Ross about all this.
rachel People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin
gavin Don't be. It's just bad timing.
rachel So seriously...rodeo clown?
gavin One of the best, ma'am, one of the best...
phoebe "No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!" Thank you!
mike Oh she's my girlfriend. That's not just how we do it here. I got to get a break and when we come back we've got Kennethsinging "I touch myself"...I'm not here to judge!
phoebe Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.
monica No I told you I can't.
phoebe But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.
monica What have you heard me sing?
phoebe All the time when you're cooking.
monica What?
phoebe Yeah you're always singing "Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy"
monica Yeah I do rock that one.
phoebe OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?
monica Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...
mike Well I've got a book around...
monica "Delta Dawn"
ross Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace
woman You already hit on me an hour ago
ross Right, so that's a firm "no". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.
chandler I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed
ross This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.
chandler By drowning or...?!
michelle Why would he break up with me?
her_friend I don't know sweetie.
michelle All I ever wanted was just love him and have him love me back. I mean, am I so unlovable?
chandler Well...
ross I know!
mike All right, that was Kenneth with his much too literal rendition of "I touch myself". Coming up next we've got Monicasinging "Delta Dawn".
monica Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.
phoebe Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.
monica Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing "Delta Dawn""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?.."
phoebe Can you totally see through her shirt ?
mike Like an X-Ray. Bad day not to wear a bra.
monica "To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?"
joey Hey, I need your help.
chandler Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?
joey Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped
chandler I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!
joey You may be a sissy but I'll still All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!
chandler It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!
joey All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.
chandler Ok. First of all, this is green!
joey What the hell am I supposed to do!
chandler All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.
joey What, what.
chandler Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his "business" partners.
joey Oh my God!
chandler Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!
joey Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!
chandler Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.
monica "Take me to the mansion in the sky-y". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?
phoebe Every little bit of you!
monica I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting "look at those tips"! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?
mike Sure.
phoebe Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...
monica Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.
mike Also a good gift? Underwear.
michelle Thank you so much for letting me do this. Public bathrooms freak me out, I can't even pee, let alone doanything else.
ross But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.
michelle It's so amazing I met you the same day that Eric broke up with me, because it's like you lose a boyfriend,you get a boyfriend.
ross Uh-ah!
michelle No don't worry, this is not some rebound thing. I am totally over Eric.
ross Good choice Ross.
rachel Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!
ross Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.
rachel Listen, my mum is not bringing the baby back until nine o clock. So I was hoping you and I could have achance to kind of talk somebody here?
ross Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.
rachel Who?
ross Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.
rachel You've being seeing someone?
ross Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.
michelle What are you taking amoxicillin for?
ross How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.
rachel Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.
michelle Ah, who is Emma?
ross I told you about my daughter.
michelle This is your daughter? I can be your new mummy!
chandler And done!
joey Oh my God! I didn't feel a thing ! Hey, are you still looking for a job because you can tweeze circles aroundthat sadistic bitch at the saloon
chandler Thanks. You wanna see what it looks like?
joey Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!
chandler Yeah, yeah, I think it looks pretty good. I was a little worried I was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.
joey Thank you so much.
chandler No problem.
joey Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.
chandler Yeah.
joey Comb my eyelashes.
monica Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters I am so excited'. And make it bouncy!
phoebe Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.
chandler I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.
monica Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!
chandler Really? In front of all this people?
monica And they love me!
chandler Oh my God!
phoebe Yes, she gives the people what they want.
monica All right, watch!
monica "Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen, tonight we'll put all other things aside. Give in thistime and show me some affection..."
chandler Are those my wife's nipples?
phoebe Oh? Isn't that funny? I didn't see that before, I wouldn't have let her go up again.
chandler I gotta stop this.
monica Oh, who cares, they still love me! "I am so excited..."
chandler You, touching yourself, out!
rachel Wow. She does that a lot!
michelle Ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor!
rachel What, what, wait a minute! You haven't even told her you were a doctor, yet? How long have you known her, likean hour?
michelle Actually about an hour and a half.
ross I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.
michelle You feel that too? Oh, I thought that was just me!
ross Are you kidding?
michelle Hey, do you want to go away this weekend?
ross We'll see.
rachel Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?
ross I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?
rachel How do you know about that?
ross Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...
michelle Emma.
ross When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?
rachel Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?
michelle No, actually, see I had to pee, cause I can't use public bathrooms because the doodie parasites.
ross Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.
michelle Well, call me!
ross Ok.
michelle No, wait, you don't have my phone number!
ross You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.
rachel Score.
ross Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.
rachel Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!
ross Oh, really!
rachel Yeah.
ross Oh, really!
rachel Oh yeah.
ross What about the guy from the bar?
rachel What? Who?
ross The guy you gave your number to.
rachel Whoa, how do you know about that?
ross Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.
rachel Why didn't I get that message?
ross What?
rachel From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?
ross Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?
rachel Ross?
ross I never gave it to you.
rachel Why?
ross I don't know.
rachel Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?
ross Who am I?
rachel Yes.
ross I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!
rachel Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!
ross None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!
rachel Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, what, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I say no.You know what, it's not, because it works for us! But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!
ross Uh, clearly.
rachel And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.
ross Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?
joey Hey!
rachel Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?
joey Ha, oh, of course.
rachel Thank you.
joey Your eyebrows look weird.
chandler Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine. So you just touch yourself for anything?
