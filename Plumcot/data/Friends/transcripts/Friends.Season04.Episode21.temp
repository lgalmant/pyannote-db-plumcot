chandler Y'know what? It seems like all of the sudden; so much has happened.
joey I know. Ross is getting married.
chandler Phoebe is, making people.
joey Everybody's doing stuff!
chandler And we just sit here. I mean if I die the only way people would even know I was here, would be by the ass print on this chair! Look, we have to do something. Okay? Something huge!
joey We could climb Mt. Everest!
chandler No-no, not something stupid, something huge.
joey No-no-no-no-no, I saw an ad for this video, people climb that thing everyday! We could totally do that!
chandler Why not?! I mean it's just, it's just climbing! It's just, it's just steep!
joey Yeah!
chandler We're going to Everest! Okay, it would be nice to leave an ass print on Everest!
phoebe Hey!
joey Hey!
phoebe What-what's up?
joey We're gonna climb Mt. Everest!
chandler Yeah baby!
phoebe Really?! I looked into that. Yeah, but, I mean it costs like $60,000 and y'know you can die. And, you would die!
chandler Yeah, well
joey We could get that Everest video though.
chandler Yeah, we could do that without y'know risking our lives at all!
joey And while we're down at the video store, you know what else we could rent? Die Hard! Oh, y'know what? I just remembered, that Everest thing is only available through mail order.
chandler Oh, well
phoebe So you guys'll stay here and hang out with me?
chandler Yeeeeahhhh.
joey Yeah. Yeah.
chandler But I'll tell you something. One of these days we're get off of our buts and rent Die Hard again!
joey Yeah we are!
emily So what did he decide? Does your Uncle Nathan get an invite or not?
ross Ohh, God, nobody likes him, and he's so cheap, he'd never fly to London in a million years. Yeah, invite him? Hey, did I do these neat enough?
emily Yeah, they're fine.
ross Yeah?
emily If anyone asks, we'll just say Ben addressed them. Oh! So you invited Rachel then?
ross Sure. Why not?
emily Really?
ross Yeah?
emily I don't think I'd be comfortable with any of my old lovers there.
ross Wait-wait-wait, do you, do you think, maybe we shouldn't invite her?
emily Oh, no-no, y'know I absolutely adore Rachel it's just that, well it might be a awkward for you. But it's absolutely your decision. More tea?
ross Yeah sure.
emily Earl Grey?
ross Huh? Yeah, fine, invite whoever you want.
ross I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
chandler And I just want a million dollars!
monica Rachel?!
rachel Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
monica Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
rachel Hi, sure!
ross Hi.
ross You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
rachel I knew.
ross You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
rachel I did.
ross Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
rachel Yeah, maybe...
ross Okay... okay, maybe I will...
ross See, I see.... big passion in your future.
rachel Really?
ross I do.
rachel Oh Ross, you're so great.
joey It's never gonna happen.
ross Hey, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
rachel Okay.
ross Okay. Umm, for a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
rachel Ohhh!!!!
ross Yes, yes, that's right...
rachel Oh, look at the little cat! Look at it!
ross What? Ow!
monica_joey_and_phoebe I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find...
rachel All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
rachel Yes! Did you see that?
ross You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
rachel I could not have done this without you.
ross Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine.
ross You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
rachel What?
ross I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
rachel Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?
ross The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.
rachel Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.
ross Fine.
rachel 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
ross Good.
rachel Good.
rachel Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
ross No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
rachel Well neither do I!
ross Is this about Mark?
rachel Oh my God.
ross Okay, it's not, it's not.
rachel Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
ross Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
rachel I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
ross Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
rachel No. A break from us.
chloe Do I know why we're rushing?
ross Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night? Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me. Oh, I found it!!
chloe That's so great for you guys!
ross Yeah!
chloe Good luck, with your girlfriend.
ross Oh, thank you. Hey, hey. Rachel!!!!
rachel Hi. Ohhh, you got my message.
ross Yeah, oh hey, you are right on time.
rachel So what do you say? Can I be your girlfriend again?
ross Yes, you can, very much.
ross Ahhhh!!
rachel Y'know what, I want you to leave! Get outta here!
ross No!!
rachel Just get out! Now!!
ross No!! No!! I wanna stay. I wanna talk about this.
rachel Okay! All right! How was she?
chandler Uh-oh.
ross What?
rachel Was she good?
joey Don't answer that.
rachel Come on Ross! You said you wanted to talk about it, let's talk about it!! How was she?
ross She was...
joey Awful! Horrible!
chandler She was not good. Not good.
joey She was nothing compared to you.
ross She, she was different.
joey Ewwwww!
chandler Uh-oh.
rachel Good different?
ross Nobody likes change.
ross What? Okay, okay, okay, okay.
rachel ..the way you owned up to everything, it just showed me how much you've grown. Y'know? I mean my Mom never thought this would work out. It was all, "Once a cheater, always a cheater." Ooh, I just wish we hadn't lost those four months, but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...
ross WE WERE ON A BREAK!!!!!!!
rachel You seem to really like her.
ross Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
rachel Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monica's photo albums, I mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
ross You think?
rachel Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and you're sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
ross Hey, you're right.
rachel Yeah.
monica Ohh, this is soo amazing! I can't believe my brother's getting married! And in London! It's so romantic!
joey Hey, pretty smart! Tissue paper! You're at the wedding, you have to cry, "Handkerchief?" "No-no, I got my invitation."
phoebe Oooh look! Isn't this adorable, Ross let Ben address mine!
chandler Hello!
joey Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey! Hey, did you get your invitation to Ross's wedding?
chandler Noo.
joey Don't worry man, I get to bring a guest. We'll show him.
phoebe I'm so jealous you're all going! I can't believe I never knew that you can't fly in your third trimester!
chandler I didn't know that.
monica I never knew that either.
joey I knew that! I sooo didn't know that, but you should see your faces.
rachel Hey guys! What's up?
joey Heyyy.
monica We're hanging out.
rachel What's this? Is this Ross's wedding invitation?
chandler See, maybe that's the one we should've actually hidden.
rachel Oh, no! No you guys! Come on, you don't have to do that! I'm happy for him! I am! I really-I'm-I'm happ-I'll work on it.
monica I'm sorry honey.
rachel Yeah.
monica Rach, you're gonna come though aren't you?
rachel Oh, honey, I don't know. I
chandler This isn't one of those uh, y'know "If she doesn't come, we-we don't, we don't come?" Right? Because I already bought my ticket
monica You know what would be real weird? Is if you weren't there. Just say you'll think about it, okay?
rachel No, I'll think about it. Yeah.
rachel Who's this from?
chandler Oh, that's Ross's.
rachel Oh... Oh my God. He remembered.
phoebe Remembered what?
rachel It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him that it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
phoebe Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
monica I can't believe he did this.
chandler Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
rachel What did you just say?
chandler F-hah.... flennin....
rachel Oh.... my God.
rachel Oh my God.
julie Well, Ross and I were in grad school together.
ross But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig.
rachel Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?
ross Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either.
rachel She didn't hang up either...
ross Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y-
rachel Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat......I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure.
ross Rach, I got a message from you.
rachel Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the.
ross You're over me?

ross OK, I need to lie down.
joey He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes.
rachel Really?
ross Really. It's always been you, Rach.
rachel Oh, god.
chandler_and_joey Ohhh.
ross I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
rachel Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
rachel Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
ross What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
ross Gunther! Gunther. Gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to Rachel about me and the girl from the Xerox place.
gunther I'm sorry. Was I not supposed to?
ross Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
rachel Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!
ross You still love me?
rachel Noo.
ross What does this mean? What do you, I mean do you wanna, get back together?
rachel Noo! Maybe! I, I don't know.
ross What?!
rachel I just, I feel, I-I just...
rachel Y'know I can't believe I even thought about getting back together again! We are so over!!
ross FINE BY ME!!

monica Oh, dad, turn it off.

joey Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.
rachel I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late.
monica If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
mrs_geller I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
ross Y'know what? I think we've seen enough, let's turn it off.
all No, no, no.
ross OK, fine, well I'm not gonna watch, alright.

mr_geller Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining-Oh no.
rachel_monica_roy_and_chip Bye.
mrs_geller Oh, dear. Jack, how do I turn this off?
monica I can't believe you did that.
ross Yeah, well.
phoebe See, he's her lobster.
monica Nooooo. You're really not going?
rachel Yeah. It's just gonna be too hard. Y'know? I mean, it's Ross. How can I watch him get married? Y'know it's just, it's for the best, y'know it is, it's... Y'know, plus, somebody's got to stay here with Phoebe! Y'know she's gonna be pretty big by then, and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour.
monica You don't have a car. And your license expired.
rachel I know. Yeah, see, there's so much to do and I have so little time to do it in.
chandler All right, check it out. Check this out. It says here that there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums! "It's almost as good as being there."
joey It's better! You can't go to a museum in your underwear!
chandler Well, You could, but... probably just the one time.
joey I bet we could get videos of all the sites, get a VCR in our hotel room... we'd never even have to go outside!
chandler If we do that, we gotta get Die Hard.
joey Oh-ho! I bet the British version is gooooood!
