monica_geller What's so funny?
joey_tribbiani Oh, nothing, no. It's an acting exercise, I'm practising my fake laugh.
monica_geller Oh.
joey_tribbiani What-what's so funny?
gunther Oh, no-no, no-no-no, there's none of that in here.
chandler_bing Oh come on man! At least let me finish this last one.
gunther Okay, but only if you give me a drag.
chandler_bing Okay.
gunther Oh dark mother, once again I suckle at your smokey tit.
chandler_bing No-no, why don't you hang on to that one.
chandler_bing Okay, that's like the least fun game ever.
rachel_green Well, I'm really sick of your smoking, so I brought something that is going to help you quit.
chandler_bing Oh. Nope, that patch is no good.
rachel_green Come on, it's a hypnosis tape. This woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn't smoked since.
dr_ross_geller Pffhah.
rachel_green What's your problem?
dr_ross_geller Nothing, it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.
rachel_green Ross, I watched you get hypnotised in Atlantic City.
dr_ross_geller Hey, that guy did not hypnotise me! Okay.
rachel_green Oh right, 'cause you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play Wipe-out on your butt cheeks.
phoebe_buffay All right, y'know forget hypnosis. The way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather, and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men.
chandler_bing Or what my Father called Thursday night.
dr_ross_geller Here you go.
rachel_green Oh, y'know what, I didn't want cinnamon on this.
dr_ross_geller Sorry.
frank_buffay_jr Hi!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!!
frank_buffay_jr Hi!
phoebe_buffay Frank! Hi!
frank_buffay_jr How are you?
phoebe_buffay What are you doing here?
frank_buffay_jr Oh, well y'know, I would've called but I lost your phone number and then ah, my Mom locked me out of the house so I couldn't find it. And then, I tried to find a pay phone, and ah, the receiver was cut off. So...
phoebe_buffay What happened?
frank_buffay_jr Ah, oh, the ah, vandalism.
phoebe_buffay But, also, what happened between you and your Mom?
frank_buffay_jr Well, we got into a fight 'cause ah, she said I was to immature to get married.
phoebe_buffay Your getting married?!
frank_buffay_jr Oh, yeah!
all@ Wow!
phoebe_buffay My little brother's getting married!!
frank_buffay_jr Oh, I knew you'd be so cool about this. All right, ah, hey, do you want to meet her?
phoebe_buffay Do I?
frank_buffay_jr Do you?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I do, yeah.
frank_buffay_jr Okay, cool, all right, she just ah, parking the truck. I'm gonna, I'm gonna get my ah, my fiancáe man!
chandler_bing Y'know, I would've bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, isn't it fantastic?
monica_geller Yeah, ah, but Pheebs don't you think he's a little young to get married?
phoebe_buffay What, he's 18.
dr_ross_geller Exactly, it'll be illegal for him to drink at his own bachelor party.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, or-or to get a hooker.
chandler_bing Always illegal Joe.
frank_buffay_jr Hey! Hey! This is ah, my fiancáe, Mrs. Knight.
alice_knight_buffay Y'know it-it's funny, um, Frank told me so much about you, but your not how I pictured you at all.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'm a big surprise.
monica_geller So, um, how-how did you guys meet?
frank_buffay_jr Well um, I was in ah Mrs. Knight's ah, I mean Alice, sorry, Alice, I always do that. I was in her ah, Home Ec class.
alice_knight_buffay And he was my best student.
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, she was my best teacher.
alice_knight_buffay Ohhh.
chandler_bing If that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?
dr_ross_geller And so now you guys are gonna be married?
alice_knight_buffay Yeah. Y'know we-we talked about just living together, but um, we want to have kids right away.
rachel_green Oh my God!! Great!
phoebe_buffay Wow, kids. Frank, are you sure you're ready for that?
frank_buffay_jr I mean, how hard can it be? Y'know, I mean, y'know, babies, y'know who doesn't want babies right? And besides y'know, I never had a Dad around, and ah, now-now I always will, 'cause y'know, it'll be me. Right?
alice_knight_buffay Y'know, I mean, really we do realise that there's an age difference between us.
phoebe_buffay Oh good! Okay. 'Cause you were acting like you didn't.
alice_knight_buffay Oh no, but when it comes to love, what does age matter?
hypnosis_tape#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode18 You are falling fast asleep. Deeper. Deeper. Deeper. You are now completely asleep. You don't need to smoke. Cigarettes don't control you. You are a strong, confident woman, who does not need to smoke. A strong, confident woman.
monica_geller And y'know what, I just realised, in the last year I've only gone out with two guys, Richard and Julio. You gotta help me out here, you gotta set me up, you gotta get me back in the game.
rachel_green Well, that shouldn't be a problem. I mean I work in fashion and all I meet are eligible straight men.
monica_geller Pete, can I get you something else?
pete_becker Yeah, a slice of cheesecake and-and a date if you're given' 'em out.
monica_geller Haven't you and I covered that topic?
pete_becker Hmm, come on, you just said to her that you....
monica_geller Aww, the only reason you want to go out with me because my blond wig, and the big boobs, and the fact that I serve you food.
pete_becker Well, if that were true, I'd dating my Aunt Ruth. And the two times we went out were just plain awkward. Come on, you think she should go out with me, don't you?
rachel_green Well, I mean, are you sure you want to go out with her? I mean that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, y'know what I mean. That wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the night stand, y'know.
monica_geller I mean really, think about it.
pete_becker Ho-ho, I will.
phoebe_buffay No, I know, I know, that this is Frank's life, y'know. Y'know, I don't want to be all judgmental, y'know, but this is sick, it's sick and wrong!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, what, is it the age thing?
phoebe_buffay No-no, oh, I'm fine with the age thing y'know, until it starts sticking it's tongue down my little brother's throat!
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.
phoebe_buffay But, I mean, do you think he's gonna enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in the diapers from all the babies they have to have right away?! This is not fair to Frank, and it-it's not fair to the babies, and y'know what, it's not good home economics.
joey_tribbiani Well, have-have you told him how you feel?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Not out loud.
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, if you don't tell him, soon he's gonna be married, and then you're gonna hate yourself.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but if I do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself. I mean look at him and his Mom, I can't. But, you guys can, please you gotta talk him out of it.
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani No-no-no-no-no.
phoebe_buffay Come on, you guys, you have nothing to lose, I have everything to lose. Do you want me to lose everything? Everything?!
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani No.
phoebe_buffay Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.
joey_tribbiani So, we're walking down the street and I turn to you and I say, "Hey, let's go hang out at Totally Nude Nudes," remember? And then, and then, you turn to me and say, "Nah, let's just hang out at your place." Well, that was a nice move dumb ass.
rachel_green I think you should definitely go out with this guy.
monica_geller Nah, he doesn't do anything for me.
rachel_green Monica, last Saturday night, what happened on Walker: Texas Ranger?
monica_geller Well, umm, Walker was looking for this big bus load of kids.... All right, I get your point.
rachel_green All right.
chandler_bing Hi.
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Y'know, I forgot the combination to this about a year ago? I just carry it around. Do you have any Chap Stick?
monica_geller Uh, yeah.
rachel_green Hey, how are those tapes working out for ya?
chandler_bing Y'know what, pretty good.
rachel_green Yeah?
chandler_bing Good! I haven't smoked yet today, I feel great, and-and-and confident, that is a stunning blouse.

monica_geller Here you go.
chandler_bing Thanks
rachel_green Hey Mon, let's give Pete a chance Come on, he was funny, he seems really nice, and that check thing was adorable.
chandler_bing What check thing?
monica_geller As a joke, this customer at work who has a crush on me gave me a $20,000 tip. His number is on the check, he just did so I'd call him.
chandler_bing Pete Becker. Pete... Is this him?
monica_geller That's Bill Clinton.
chandler_bing Who's he huggin'?
monica_geller Oh my God! That's Pete! But why is Bill huggin' Pete?
chandler_bing This guy invented Moss 865! Every office in the world uses that program!
rachel_green We use it!!
chandler_bing There you go!!
rachel_green Oh my God, Monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.
monica_geller I'm not gonna go out with him.
rachel_green Oh my God, I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check, oh this is just so exciting.
monica_geller Or incredibly offensive.
rachel_green Oh yeah, sure, that too.
chandler_bing What?
dr_ross_geller All we're saying is don't rush into anything.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, come on, think about it. You're 18, okay, she's 44, when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.
frank_buffay_jr What, you don't think I know that?
joey_tribbiani Look, the point is, there's a lot of women out there you haven't even had sex with yet!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, he-he's right, he's right. This is your time y'know, yeah, you're young, you're-you're weird, chicks dig that.
frank_buffay_jr Okay, but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really, really care about.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, in a poem maybe.
dr_ross_geller No the man's right, that's what I had with Rachel.
frank_buffay_jr You don't have it anymore?
dr_ross_geller No, I ah, I slept with someone else.
frank_buffay_jr Okay, so wait, all right, so how does that make things better?
dr_ross_geller It didn't.
frank_buffay_jr Okay, so what you used to have with Rachel, is what I've got with Alice.
joey_tribbiani Now, wh-what, what is that like?
frank_buffay_jr It's so cool man, it's so, it's just 'cause being with her is so much better than like not being with her.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah.
joey_tribbiani Why can't I find that?
dr_ross_geller Don't ask me, I had it and I blew it!
joey_tribbiani Well, I want it!
frank_buffay_jr You can have it!
joey_tribbiani I don't know, maybe I can't. I mean, maybe there's something wrong with me.
dr_ross_geller Oh, no! No!
frank_buffay_jr It's out there man! I've seen it! I got it!!
joey_tribbiani Then you hold on to it!!
frank_buffay_jr All right, man!!
joey_tribbiani All right, congratulations you lucky bastard!
phoebe_buffay You're Frank's best man?!
joey_tribbiani I couldn't help it, there love is so pure.
phoebe_buffay Well then, what about you?! Huh?!
dr_ross_geller I'm the ring bearer.
phoebe_buffay Hi! Oh, Alice, hi! Thanks. I'm so glad you could come, 'cause I've got a real umm, Home Ec emergency.
alice_knight_buffay Oh my God, who died on this?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I know. It's a real mustard-tastrophe. Can you help me?
alice_knight_buffay Absolutely. Okay, first we'll start with a little club soda and salt, and then if that doesn't work we can go back to
phoebe_buffay Y'know what, forget it. It's ruined.
alice_knight_buffay Oh no-no, never say that. If we can't get it out then we can cut around the stain, add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
phoebe_buffay Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother Frank.
pete_becker Okay, that's great, but can we make it smaller? Can we make it fit on the head of a pin? I love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.
all@ Got it. Yeah all right. Yeah, okay.
secretary#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode18 You have a Miss Monica Geller here.
pete_becker Uh, absolutely, yeah, sEnd her in. Hi.
monica_geller What the hell is this?
pete_becker Hang on a second. I'll-I'll talk to you in the morning. I'm sorry what?
monica_geller Seriously, what is this supposed to mean?
pete_becker Well, y'know, I never know how much to tip.
monica_geller You're supposed to double the tax. Not double the tax of Romania. I mean, what's-what's the deal? Are you, are you trying to buy me? Is this the way you get girls to go out with you?
employee#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode18 Umm, I'm still here.
pete_becker You're taking this all wrong. Because, if I didn't leave you that tip, you wouldn't of come down here, we wouldn't be having this argument, and there wouldn't be this ah, heat between us.
monica_geller What?!
pete_becker Come on, you gotta admit that our relationship is ah, is hitting a new level now. 'Cause you used to be like the chef, and I was the customer, and now we're like this-this couple that fights.
monica_geller Okay, umm, you're a loon.
pete_becker Look, forget the check, okay. I like you. I think you're great. Come on, what do you say?
monica_geller I don't know.
pete_becker Why not?
monica_geller 'Cause I don't want to encourage this kind of behaviour.
pete_becker One meal! That's all I'm asking for. Please? We go out, we eat, and if you don't have a good time, I give you ten grand, we call it even.
frank_buffay_jr Hi. Wait, no! Just put the mail down. It's-it's me!
phoebe_buffay Okay. Whoa, sorry. Why were you just like all in the dark?
frank_buffay_jr Oh well, um, your, your laundry just smelled so good, that I thought I'd curl up in it. Is that all right?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, sure. So, how was your day?
frank_buffay_jr Oh, well just probably the worst one since I've been alive.
phoebe_buffay What umm, what happened?
frank_buffay_jr Umm, Alice ah, she ah, called it off.
phoebe_buffay Oh no. Did umm, did she say why?
frank_buffay_jr Uh, no, not really, just that I was too young, y'know, but I don't see how I could all of the sudden be too young, 'cause I'm older than I was when we first got together.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. But, y'know what, maybe it's just all for the best?
frank_buffay_jr Yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain!
phoebe_buffay Oh, sweetie, oh.
frank_buffay_jr Y'know, I just was finally happy y'know. For the first time in my life! After my Dad left me, and then, and then getting arrested for stealing those birds, and then, and then the whole punctured lung thing! I can, it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather, but with Alice all that stuff kinda went away. And now it's, and now it's gone and I don't know why!
phoebe_buffay Uh, well I can tell you why. It's, it's because of me. But, y'know what, I only did it because I love you. Okay?
frank_buffay_jr What?
phoebe_buffay Umm, well I, I kinda had a little chat with Alice, and I sort of made her see why you two shouldn't be together, y'know. And you're gonna see it to, one day, you really, really will.
frank_buffay_jr Wait a minute, wait, this is because of you?
phoebe_buffay Okay.
frank_buffay_jr Well, you, wait no, my Mother didn't want us to be together, but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
phoebe_buffay Okay, but.
frank_buffay_jr Wait, y'know what, I-I came to you because I thought you'd understand! Oh no!! Y'know, I would storm out of here right now if-if I had some money, or a place to go
rachel_green Oh my God! The millionaire's here!
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller Guys, please, I'm just gonna have dinner with him. Okay?
chandler_bing Okay, okay, just because he buys you dinner, does not mean you owe him anything.
monica_geller I know!!
chandler_bing Okay, then get the lobster!
monica_geller Hey!

alice_knight_buffay Hi Frank.
frank_buffay_jr Hi, Mrs. Knight.
alice_knight_buffay Phoebe's right Frank. I know it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it. I-I-I was being selfish, even though we, we want the same things now, in the future we may not. Is that it, is that what it is?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but not just that.
alice_knight_buffay Right, not just that. Umm, even though we love each other as much as we do, none the less
phoebe_buffay None the less.
alice_knight_buffay None the less. Umm, you're too young to, to really know what you want.
phoebe_buffay That's right, exactly. All right, it's a good bye kiss, that's good. Bye-bye. Okay, no, the important thing is that you see what I'm saying, y'know, just y'know, this is clearly wrong. Okay, I've decided I'm gonna let this happen! Okay, can I just get my purse? Okay, all right, good.
