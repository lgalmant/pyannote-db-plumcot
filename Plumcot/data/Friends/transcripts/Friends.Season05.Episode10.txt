joey_tribbiani What are you doing?
dr_ross_geller I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. And top shelf: expired products.
joey_tribbiani Why are you doing this?
dr_ross_geller Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
joey_tribbiani Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
dr_ross_geller Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
joey_tribbiani Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
dr_ross_geller So what, we just sit?
joey_tribbiani Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
chandler_bing Hello, Chandler Bing.
joey_tribbiani Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
chandler_bing Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
joey_tribbiani But, I love you.
chandler_bing Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
joey_tribbiani And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys, guess what?

phoebe_buffay Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
chandler_bing Ohh.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
monica_geller You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
joey_tribbiani So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
phoebe_buffay Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
rachel_green Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
danny Hey guys.
all@ Hey Danny.
monica_geller Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
rachel_green Thanks, Mon.
danny Well, of course.
monica_geller Do you want to go out on a date with her?
rachel_green Monica!!!
danny Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
monica_geller Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
danny On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
rachel_green Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
joey_tribbiani How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
estelle_leonard Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
joey_tribbiani She's a woman!
estelle_leonard What can I say? She nailed it.
joey_tribbiani Okay, is there anything else?
estelle_leonard Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.

phoebe_buffay Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
phoebe_buffay Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
phoebe_buffay Wait, you can't take the money out.
the_man I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
phoebe_buffay But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
the_man I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
phoebe_buffay Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still
the_man Bite me, blondie!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just
joey_tribbiani That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
joey_tribbiani Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
joey_tribbiani Wait a second, I could star in it!
dr_ross_geller Or that.
joey_tribbiani I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
dr_ross_geller I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
joey_tribbiani Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Thanks!
dr_ross_geller All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
joey_tribbiani Done!
dr_ross_geller And it can't be Joey.
joey_tribbiani It's not.
dr_ross_geller Or Joseph.
joey_tribbiani Oh.
monica_geller Hey, what's up?
rachel_green I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
monica_geller Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
rachel_green Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
monica_geller You had no relationship!!
rachel_green No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
monica_geller Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
rachel_green She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
monica_geller Come on, hurry!
joey_tribbiani Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
chandler_bing Why?
joey_tribbiani Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
chandler_bing Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
joey_tribbiani You're driving me crazy with that!
chandler_bing Okay, I'll stop.
joey_tribbiani Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
joey_tribbiani Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
chandler_bing You wanna play?
joey_tribbiani Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
chandler_bing Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
joey_tribbiani All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
chandler_bing I'm intrigued.
joey_tribbiani All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
chandler_bing Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
chandler_bing Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
joey_tribbiani Uh yeah, right here.
phoebe_buffay Thank you, Happy Holidays.
phoebe_buffay Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
phoebe_buffay Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
dr_ross_geller All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
chandler_bing Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
dr_ross_geller This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
joey_tribbiani You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
dr_ross_geller And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
danny I had a really nice time tonight.
rachel_green So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
danny I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
rachel_green You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
dannys_sister#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode10 Oh, I thought I heard you.
danny Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
rachel_green Hi!
krista Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
danny Like it would help.
krista You are so bad!
danny You are!
krista You are!
danny You are!
krista You are!
danny You are!
krista You are!
danny You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
rachel_green Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
phoebe_buffay Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
monica_geller No.
phoebe_buffay Does it look like an ashtray?
monica_geller No.
phoebe_buffay Does it look like a urinal?
monica_geller Eww!!
dr_ross_geller So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
phoebe_buffay Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
monica_geller Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
dr_ross_geller@monica_geller Sure.
rachel_green Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, yeah.
monica_geller All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
dr_ross_geller Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
monica_geller Still, I was quick as a cat.
rachel_green Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
monica_geller Oh, you're kidding.
rachel_green Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
monica_geller We don't, we don't wrestle now.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
monica_geller Too strong for me?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
dr_ross_geller Oh fine.
monica_geller Ready? Wrestle!
rachel_green Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
chandler_bing Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
dr_ross_geller Joey's not going.
joey_tribbiani I didn't finish my five pages.
chandler_bing Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
dr_ross_geller Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
joey_tribbiani Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
chandler_bing Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
dr_ross_geller I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
joey_tribbiani Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
chandler_bing The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
dr_ross_geller I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
joey_tribbiani Come on look guys, don't fight.
dr_ross_geller And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
chandler_bing Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
dr_ross_geller If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
joey_tribbiani Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
dr_ross_geller How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
chandler_bing I paid for those tickets!
dr_ross_geller No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
chandler_bing Oh yeah!
danny ...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
joey_tribbiani Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
chandler_bing When did that happen to you?!
joey_tribbiani Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
chandler_bing Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
krista Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
danny Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
krista Here, I'll get it.
krista We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
danny Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
rachel_green Oh, great!
chandler_bing Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
monica_geller That was unbelievable!
rachel_green Okay, see? I told you!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
chandler_bing I don't believe they're brother and sister.
joey_tribbiani They're brother and sister!!!
phoebe_buffay Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
phoebe_buffay Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
bob Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
phoebe_buffay What?!
bob Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
phoebe_buffay That chick can't handle my corner.
bob Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
phoebe_buffay Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
danny Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
rachel_green Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
danny What?! Why?!
rachel_green Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
danny Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
rachel_green Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's
danny Do-do you, do you have brothers?
rachel_green No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
danny Are you close with them?
rachel_green No-no, they're not very nice people.
danny Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
rachel_green Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
krista Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
danny What?
rachel_green Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
chandler_bing Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
dr_ross_geller Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
dr_ross_geller Yay!
chandler_bing Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
joey_tribbiani No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
dr_ross_geller I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
chandler_bing Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
chandler_bing All right.
dr_ross_geller All right.
joey_tribbiani Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
dr_ross_geller Hey man.
chandler_bing What is up?
dr_ross_geller About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
chandler_bing No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
dr_ross_geller Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
chandler_bing Could I be more sorry.
dr_ross_geller I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
chandler_bing I'm sorry too.
joey_tribbiani Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
dr_ross_geller I am sorry, Chandler.
chandler_bing I am sorry, Ross.
joey_tribbiani A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
chandler_bing This took you all day?!
joey_tribbiani No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
joey_tribbiani Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
monica_geller Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
rachel_green I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
monica_geller It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
rachel_green Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
monica_geller This is disgusting!
rachel_green I'm not reading this!
joey_tribbiani What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
