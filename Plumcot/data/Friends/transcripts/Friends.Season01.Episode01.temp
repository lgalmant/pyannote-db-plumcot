monica There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
joey C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
chandler All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
phoebe Wait, does he eat chalk?
phoebe Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
monica Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
chandler Sounds like a date to me.
chandler Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
all Oh, yeah. Had that dream.
chandler Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
joey Instead of...?
chandler That's right.
joey Never had that dream.
phoebe No.
chandler All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
monica And they weren't looking at you before?!
chandler Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
ross Hi.
joey This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
monica Are you okay, sweetie?
ross I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
chandler Cookie?
monica Carol moved her stuff out today.
joey Ohh.
monica Let me get you some coffee.
ross Thanks.
phoebe Ooh! Oh!
ross No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
phoebe Fine!  Be murky!
ross I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
monica No you don't.
ross No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
joey And you never knew she was a lesbian...
ross No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
chandler Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?
ross I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
monica Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3
ross Sorry.
joey Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
joey Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
ross I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
chandler And I just want a million dollars!
monica Rachel?!
rachel Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
waitress Can I get you some coffee?
monica De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
rachel Hi, sure!
ross Hi.
monica So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
rachel Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me
monica Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
monica Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
chandler Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
ross I'll have whatever Christine is having.
rachel Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
phoebe If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
chandler Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
joey I say push her down the stairs.
rachel C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
ross You can see where he'd have trouble.
rachel Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
monica Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
rachel Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
monica Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
phoebe Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
rachel I'm all better now.
phoebe I helped!
monica Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.
joey And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
monica Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
joey What, like there's a rule or something?
chandler Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
paul It's, uh, it's Paul.
monica Oh God, is it 6
joey Who's Paul?
ross Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
monica Maybe. Joey
ross He finally asked you out?
monica Yes!
chandler Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
monica Rach, wait, I can cancel...
rachel Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
monica Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
ross That'd be good...
monica Really?
ross No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
phoebe What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?
monica Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
all Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
chandler I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
monica Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
ross A wandering?
monica Change!  Okay, sit down. Two seconds.
phoebe Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
joey Hey, Paul!
paul Yeah?
joey Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
monica Shut up, Joey!
ross So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
rachel Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
ross Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
chandler Yes, and we're very excited about it.
rachel Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
ross Okay, sure.
joey Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
phoebe Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
phoebe Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- Thank you. La-la-la-la...ohhh!
ross I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
joey I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
chandler It's a beautiful thing.
joey What's this?
chandler I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
joey Which goes where?
chandler I have no idea.
joey Done with the bookcase!
chandler All finished!
ross This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
joey Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
chandler Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
joey Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
ross You guys.
chandler Oh, God.
joey You got screwed.
chandler Oh my God!
monica Oh my God!
paul I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?
monica My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
paul Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-
monica -leg?
paul That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.
monica You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
paul Ooh, steer clear of you.
rachel Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too...
ross I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
joey Shut up!
chandler You must stop!
ross That only took me an hour.
chandler Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
ross You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
joey What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
ross I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
paul Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...
monica What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
paul No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.
monica Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
paul Isn't there?
monica Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
paul Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform. ...Sexually.
monica Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
paul It's okay...
monica I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
paul Two years.
monica Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
paul So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?
monica ...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
priest_on_tv We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.
rachel Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
ross Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
joey Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,
chandler Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
joey Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here.
ross Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?
rachel Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
chandler That is amazing.
joey Congratulations.
rachel Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
chandler If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
joey Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
monica Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
all Morning. Good morning.
paul Morning.
joey Morning, Paul.
rachel Hello, Paul.
chandler Hi, Paul, is it?
paul Thank you!  Thank you so much!
monica Stop!
paul No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness.
monica We'll talk later.
paul Yeah. Thank you.
joey That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
monica Shut up, and put my table back.
all Okayyy!
chandler All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
rachel So, like, you guys all have jobs?
monica Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
joey Yeah, I'm an actor.
rachel Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
joey I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
monica Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
joey Look, it was a job all right?
chandler 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
joey I will not take this abuse.
chandler You're right, I'm sorry. "Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..."
joey You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler?
monica So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
rachel I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
monica I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
rachel Oh, yeah.
monica Well, it's like that. With feelings.
rachel Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
monica Big time!
rachel Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.
monica I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
rachel Oh, look, wish me luck!
monica What for?
rachel I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
frannie Hey, Monica!
monica Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
frannie You had sex, didn't you?
monica How do you do that?
frannie Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?
monica You know Paul?
frannie Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.
monica You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
frannie Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.
joey Of course it was a line!
monica Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
ross I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
monica I hate men!  I hate men!
phoebe Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
monica Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
phoebe All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.
monica I just thought he was nice, y'know?
joey I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
rachel Guess what?
ross You got a job?
rachel Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
chandler And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
rachel You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
chandler Oh, how well you know me...
rachel They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
monica How'd you pay for them?
rachel Uh, credit card.
monica And who pays for that?
rachel Um... my... father.
rachel Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
monica C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
rachel I know that. That's why I was getting married.
phoebe Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
rachel Thank you.
phoebe You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
ross The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
monica All right, you ready?
rachel No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!
monica You can, I know you can!
rachel I don't think so.
ross Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!
ross C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
all Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...
rachel Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
monica Rachel!  That was a library card!
all Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
chandler Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
monica Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
monica Well, that's it You gonna crash on the couch?
ross No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
monica You be okay?
ross Yeah.
rachel Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What?
monica That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
ross_and_rachel Goodnight.
ross Mmm. Oh, no-
rachel Sorry-
ross No no no, go-
rachel No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
ross Split it?
rachel Okay.
ross Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
rachel I knew.
ross You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
rachel I did.
ross Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
rachel Yeah, maybe...
ross Okay... okay, maybe I will...
rachel Goodnight.
ross Goodnight.
monica See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
ross I just grabbed a spoon.
joey I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
phoebe I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
monica What? I-I said you had a-
phoebe What I said you had...
monica Would you stop?
phoebe Oh, was I doing it again?
all Yes!
monica I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
joey Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
ross There's an image.
rachel Would anybody like more coffee?
chandler Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
rachel I'm just serving it.
all Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
chandler Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.
customer Ahh, miss?   More coffee?
rachel Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
chandler Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
