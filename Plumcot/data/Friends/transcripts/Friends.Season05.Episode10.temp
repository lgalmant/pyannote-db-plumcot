joey What are you doing?
ross I...reorganized the fridge. See, bottom shelf: meats and dairy. Middle shelf: fruits and vegetables. And top shelf: expired products.
joey Why are you doing this?
ross Because I am bored...Out of my mind. I've already been to the bank, post office, and the dry cleaners.
joey Dude, you just described seven days worth of stuff. You've got to spread it out a little, you know. Haven't you ever been unemployed?
ross Hey, I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
joey Hey, don't get religious on me, ok. A guy in your position needs to be a little better at relaxing. You know. Why do you think we have the comfortable chairs? Huh...come here...sit down. Ready? Ahh!! Ohh, yeah!! Huh?!
ross So what, we just sit?
joey Ohh, no, no. We're not going to just sit. Shhh.
chandler Hello, Chandler Bing.
joey Hello Mr. Bing...I love you.
chandler Alright, whoever this is, stop calling me! It's been six months! It's not funny!
joey But, I love you.
chandler Leave me alone! For the love of God, leave me alone!!!
joey And that's Wednesday. Ohh.
phoebe Hey you guys, guess what?
chandler The British are coming?
phoebe Ohh, you and your ways. Since it's Christmastime. I'm going to be one of those people collection donations.
all Ohh.
phoebe Yeah, I already have my bell and later on...I get my bucket.
chandler Ohh.
phoebe Yeah, yeah, I'm going to be out there spreading joy to the people. I mean, last year, I spread a little joy but not really enough. So this year, I'm going to do the whole city.
monica You know, I knew a girl in high school who did that. She was very popular.
joey So Pheebs, where are you doing all, your bell ringing?
phoebe Ohh, they gave me a great spot. Right by Macys. Yeah, they hardly ever give such a good spot to a rookie, but I'm the only one who can sing "Merry Christmas" in 25 languages. I lied.
rachel Oh my god. Ok you guys, there's Danny. Watch. Just watch this. See?! Still pretending he's not interested. Ohh, he's coming over. Just pretend like we don't know him. We've forgotten who he is.
danny Hey guys.
all Hey Danny.
monica Danny? You know Rachel? She's nice. She's not bad to look at, right?
rachel Thanks, Mon.
danny Well, of course.

danny Absolutely! Is Friday okay?
monica Friday's perfect...She can't wait.
danny On the date, I will be able to talk to her directly? See ya Friday.
rachel Okay. What the hell was that? You know what? Don't answer me. I have a date with Danny.
joey How could I not get the part? The play was about a 29-year-old Italian actor from Queens.
estelle Well, Telia Shire suddenly became available.
joey She's a woman!
estelle What can I say? She nailed it.
joey Okay, is there anything else?
estelle Well, you're just going to say no again but...gay porn.

monica Yes Phoebe, but this is all I have. Okay?
phoebe Okay! Thanks! Happy Holidays, here's your joy.
phoebe Thank you! And Happy Holidays.
phoebe Wait, you can't take the money out.
the_man I'm making change. I need change for the bus.
phoebe But, can't you leave the dollar? This money is for the poor.
the_man I'm poor! I gotta take the bus!
phoebe Okay, Seasons Greetings and everything, but still
the_man Bite me, blondie!
phoebe Oh, I'm going to give him something else besides joy, just
joey That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!
ross I'm sorry, man. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should make something happen for yourself. Y'know, like-like write a play. Write a movie! Huh? I mean, what about those Good Will Hunting guys?
joey Come on Ross be realistic, y'know? If I did write something, what are the chances I could get those guys to star in it?
joey Wait a second, I could star in it!
ross Or that.
joey I can't write! Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know? I can't do it.
ross I'll help you. Yeah, I'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it. And plus, it'll give me something to do.
joey Really? You'd-you'd do that for me?!
ross Yeah!
joey Thanks!
ross All right, we'll start off slow. The only thing you have to do tonight is come up with the name of your main character.
joey Done!
ross And it can't be Joey.
joey It's not.
ross Or Joseph.
joey Oh.
monica Hey, what's up?
rachel I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her.
monica Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
rachel Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!!
monica You had no relationship!!
rachel No, but I was doing my thing and everything was going according to the plan!
monica Oh God, stop with the plan! So what, so what you saw him with a girl? Who cares?! That doesn't mean anything! Now look, you're going to go out on a date with Danny and you're going to be so charming he's gonna forget all about that stupid subway girl.
rachel She was kinda stupid. You're right. All right, I'm just gonna go on the date. I'm gonna go on the date. That is the new plan.
monica Come on, hurry!
joey Hey, how do you spell suspicious?
chandler Why?
joey Because I think this character is going to be suspicious about stuff.
chandler Yes! Chandler Bing, 7! Chandler Bing, 0.
joey You're driving me crazy with that!
chandler Okay, I'll stop.
joey Don't stop! Move the bowl further away! Ross could make that shot!
joey Well, you suck! But at least you suck at a man's game now.
chandler You wanna play?
joey Chandler, I can't be playing games, Ross is gonna be home soon. And I have to write five whole pages if I'm gonna stick to his schedule.
chandler Well, so, play for the next 30 minutes and then write until he gets home.
joey All right! But uh, listen, what do you say we crank it up a notch?
chandler I'm intrigued.
joey All right, all we need is a little lighter fluid.
chandler Okay, but be careful okay, because I wanna get our security deposit back.
joey Yeah, I think we said good-bye to that when we invented hammer darts.
chandler Do you even remember which part of the wall is not spackle?
joey Uh yeah, right here.
phoebe Thank you, Happy Holidays.
phoebe Now, that's trash. Young lady, you can't... Hey! Stop that young lady, she donated trash!
phoebe Hey!! The charity's on fire! Help! Oh good! Thank you, I need that. Whoa! What is that?! It's nine o'clock in the morning!
ross All right. A room. A man enters, he looks suspicious. That's it? Joey, you're supposed to have five pages done by now! Including an exciting incident! And what is, and what is all this?! The official rulebook of Fireball.
joey Yeah, that's the uh, game we were playing.
chandler Oh yeah, it's great! See you take a tennis ball, a bowl, and some lighter fluid-Op! Op!
ross This is helping your career?! Huh? I thought you wanted to be an actor not the creator of crazy lawsuit game!
joey You're right, you're right, I'll get back to work.
ross And shame on you! You should know better, Joey needs to work. Now come on!
joey Hey!
ross No! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! You can have this back when the five pages are done! Ahh!
danny I had a really nice time tonight.
rachel So did I. I'm really glad Monica asked us out.
danny I'd love to ask you in, but uh, my sister's visiting and I think she's asleep on the couch.
rachel You're sister? You're sister's asleep on the couch? Ohhh! I saw her with you on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch!
dannys_sister Oh, I thought I heard you.
danny Oh hey, great, you're up. Rachel, this is my sister Krista. Krista, this is Rachel.
rachel Hi!
krista Nice to meet you. I wish you'd told me we were having company, I'd fix myself up!
danny Like it would help.
krista You are so bad!
danny You are!
krista You are!
danny You are!
krista You are!
danny You are!
krista You are!
danny You are so dead! I'm gonna get you.
rachel Uh, it was very nice meeting you.
phoebe Nobody! Nobody respects the bucket! You wouldn't believe what people put in here! Look! Okay, does this look like a garbage can to you?
monica No.
phoebe Does it look like an ashtray?
monica No.
phoebe Does it look like a urinal?
monica Eww!!
ross So Pheebs, are you gonna go back out there or what?
phoebe Well, yeah! But I'm not gonna take anymore crap. Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket!
monica Yeah, good for you. Y'know you're tough, you lived on the streets.
phoebe Yeah, I'm gonna go back to being Street Phoebe. Yeah! Oh but, y'know what? I can't go totally back because Street Phoebe really wouldn't be friends with you guys. Sorry.
rachel Hey!
monica Hey!
rachel Hey, umm, can I ask you guys something?
monica_and_ross Sure.
rachel Uh, I don't have any brothers so I don't know, but uh, did you guys wrestle?
ross Oh-oh, yeah.
monica All the time. In fact, I was undefeated.
ross Uh, you weighted 200 pounds.
monica Still, I was quick as a cat.
rachel Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday, and uh that was actually the girl on the subway.
monica Oh, you're kidding.
rachel Yeah, they were very y'know...wrestley. But, I guess that's normal?
monica We don't, we don't wrestle now.
ross Yeah, not since I got too strong for you.
monica Too strong for me?
ross Yeah.
monica You wanna go right now? 'Cause I'll take you right now, buddy! You wanna go?
ross Oh fine.
monica Ready? Wrestle!
rachel Okay, y'know what uh, actually, that's great. That helps a lot. Thanks.
chandler Guys, come on! Let's go! The puck drops in 20 minutes! Come on, Joe!
ross Joey's not going.
joey I didn't finish my five pages.
chandler Well, why can't you do them tomorrow?
ross Because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.
joey Yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.
chandler Why don't you cut him a little slack? Okay? Maybe if he relaxes a little bit, he'll get some work done.
ross I think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you and Fireball.
joey Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.
chandler The only reason you're doing this to Joey is because you're bored. Okay, it's not his fault that you're unemployed.
ross I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical!
joey Come on look guys, don't fight.
ross And the reason I'm doing this is because I am Joey's friend. And if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.
chandler Oh, so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk?
ross If it does? Then you're an amazing friend of mine.
joey Hey-hey guys, hey! How about we settle this over a friendly game of Fireball? Huh? I'll go unhook the smoke detectors!
ross How about we settle this right now! There! Now, no one's going to the game. Ha-ha-ha!
chandler I paid for those tickets!
ross No you didn't. You said you would, but you never did!
chandler Oh yeah!
danny ...so we finally get to the top of the mountain and airhead here forgets the camera!
joey Oh, y'know the same thing happened to me one time.
chandler When did that happen to you?!
joey Don't you remember when we were jogging in the park and we saw that really pretty bird and wanted to take a picture-I didn't have my camera!
chandler Oh yeah. First off all, chasing the Churo guy isn't jogging.
krista Oh, this is so good you have got to try it.
danny Oh, damn! I got it on my pants.
krista Here, I'll get it.
krista We'd better take these pants off upstairs or that stain's gonna set.
danny Yep. I'm gonna wear these on our date tonight.
rachel Oh, great!
chandler Okay, bye! Oh my God!!
monica That was unbelievable!
rachel Okay, see? I told you!
joey Yeah, wow, sorry Rach.
chandler I don't believe they're brother and sister.
joey They're brother and sister!!!
phoebe Oh whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait a minute, open up your hand; let me take a look. Quarter. Dime. Lint? Not interested in that. What's this? A Canadian coin? Get outta here!
phoebe Whoa-whoa-whoa! No drinks near the bucket! Set it down over there and then you can make a contribution! And you can leave the hurt bunny look over there too! Hi Bob! I thought I told you to get outta here!
bob Uh, Phoebe we've been getting complaints and uh, we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.
phoebe What?!
bob Umm, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
phoebe That chick can't handle my corner.
bob Look, either you leave, or we remove you.
phoebe Fine. All right, I'll give you one pointer. Look out for that bitch.
danny Oh, hey Rach! I thought we said seven?
rachel Yeah uh, y'know what uh, let's skip it.
danny What?! Why?!
rachel Umm, you-you and your sister seem to have umm, a very special bond, and
danny Oh great! That special bond again! Why do women have such a problem with the fact that I'm close with my sister?
rachel Well, okay, look. I don't know, listen, I don't know what's going on here but let's
danny Do-do you, do you have brothers?
rachel No, I have two sisters. But one of them has a very masculine energy.
danny Are you close with them?
rachel No-no, they're not very nice people.
danny Okay, listen, I really like you. Okay? I think this can go somewhere. So what if I'm close to my family, are you gonna let that stand in the way of us?
rachel Well, uh, I-I don't know. See when-when you put it that way y'know it does sort of
krista Danny! Hurry up! The bath is getting cold!
danny What?
rachel Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.
chandler Oh hey! There's some kids playing in the street, you wanna go down there and give them a project, ruin their day?
ross Hey, if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game, Gonna Need Stitches Ball.
joey Hey guys! I was at the library all morning and I already finished my five pages for today!
ross Yay!
chandler Great! Now, we can go to the Ranger game! Last night!
joey No dude, Ross tore up the tickets!
ross I guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus. Huh?
chandler Yeah or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck ALL THE LIVE LONG DAY!!
joey Yeah, well, that's fine, but the important thing is that I finished it. And uh, I think it's really good, but y'know it'd really help me is if I could hear it. So would you guys read it for me?
chandler All right.
ross All right.
joey Okay. "It's a typical New York City apartment. Two guys are hanging out." Ross
ross Hey man.
chandler What is up?
ross About yesterday, I was really wrong. I am sorry.
chandler No, it was me. I'm sorry. I over reacted.
ross Maybe it was both of us, but we had our best friend's interest... But we had our best friend's interest at heart.
chandler Could I be more sorry.
ross I don't know, I'm one sorry polentologist. All right Joey, we get it. I'm sorry.
chandler I'm sorry too.
joey Oh no! No-no, keep reading! The good part's coming up. Keep going.
ross I am sorry, Chandler.
chandler I am sorry, Ross.
joey A handsome man enters. Hey! How's it going guys? I don't know what you two were talking about, but I'd like to say thanks to both of you. You, you wouldn't let me give up on myself, and you well you co-created Fireball. The end.
chandler This took you all day?!
joey No-no, this only took five minutes. I spent the rest of the day coming up with new, Ultimate Fireball. Ha-ha!
joey Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out.
monica Hi, how are you doing Kelly?
rachel I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!
monica It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?
rachel Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!
monica This is disgusting!
rachel I'm not reading this!
joey What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
