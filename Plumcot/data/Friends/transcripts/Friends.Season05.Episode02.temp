joey Later!
ross Isn't Rachel supposed to be back by now?
monica Yeah, but her plane got delayed in Athens. But actually, she should be here by now.
ross Oh, so-so you talked to her. Did she, did she sound mad?
monica No, but she likes me. You abandoned her on a plane to Greece.
ross Okay, I did not abandon Rachel! Okay? Emily showed up at the airport! I had to go after her! I mean, I-I did what I had to do! She's my wife! Rachel is my wife! Y'know-Emily! Emily, is my wife! Man, what is that?

ross Rach, Rach, I am so sorry. I am so-so sorry.
rachel Oh Ross, come on! You just did what you had to do.
ross That's it? You're not mad? I mean, it must've been terrible.
rachel Terrible? Hell, I was in Greece! That was a nice hotel! Nice beach, met the nice people. Not to shabby for Rachel.
ross So, what? That's it?
rachel Well, yeah! We're cool. Totally cool.
ross Oh, thanks. Oh, you're the best.
rachel Oh no, you're the best.
ross Ohh, I gotta go to the flower store! Check it out, no one will tell me where Emily is, so I'm gonna send 72 long-stem, red roses to Emily's parent's house, one for each day that I've known and loved her. That oughta get her talking to me again.
chandler Oh, Ross, when you make out card; be sure to make it out to, EM-I-LY.
monica Rach, that's great! It's so good that you had a good time in Greece!
rachel What?! I didn't have a good time in Greece! Ross abandoned me! Okay, I couldn't get a plane out, so I had to stay in their honeymoon suite with people coming up to me all the time going, "Oh, Mrs. Geller, why are you crying?" I mean, it was sooo humiliating. I felt like such an idiot! I mean, it's all my fault! And you know why, because I make very bad decisions.
chandler Oh that's not true.
rachel Yes it is! It is true! I went, I went after Ross in stupid London.
phoebe London is stupid! Stupid!
rachel Phoebe, you were right. I should've never gone to London, and from now on you make all of my decisions for me.
phoebe Oh... No, I did that for someone once and I'm not comfortable having that kind of power and control over someone's life.
monica I'll do it!
rachel That's fine. So Monica, you are now in control of my love life.
chandler Okay, I gotta go to work.
chandler And uh, Rachel, glad to have you back.
chandler Pheebs! Always a pleasure.
monica Oh, Rachel, sweetie, look, here's a really cute picture of Joey and you at the reception.
rachel Ohh, he's married! Ross is married. I can't-I still can't believe it.
monica Honey, sweetie, by the edges.
rachel I mean, y'know I'm just gonna have to accept it
monica Ohh.
rachel ...I mean it's my fault.
monica Sweetie! Edges! Fingers! Smudgey! Pictures!
rachel Oh my God!
monica Okay. That's okay. I-I know that you're very upset right now. I know, I know that wasn't about me.
joey I bet it was about her a little.
monica If you would stop thinking about Ross for one minute you would notice that there are great guys everywhere! I mean, look! Look, Gunther! I mean, he's nice, he's cute.
rachel Yeah, I guess Gunther is kinda
monica Oh, what about that guy over there? Remember? That is the guy you flirted with at the counter that time.
rachel Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
monica You're going to talk to him! Y'know what? We made a deal, I make your decisions and I say you're going to talk to him.

phoebe Oh! Here we all are! Yeah, there's Ross and Joey and you and me.
chandler All right, y'know what, we've been talking about London too much haven't we?
phoebe No. I'm sorry. It's just 'cause I couldn't be there. 'Cause all I ever get to do now is pregnant stuff, it just bums me out.
all Sorry.
monica What happened?
rachel Well, y'know, a little of this, a little of that. Got myself a date tomorrow night.
monica See, didn't I tell you?! You're getting over Ross already!
rachel Well

monica What took you so long?
chandler I got caught up and work, but I'm quitting tomorrow.
monica Oh, good.
chandler So, thanks for having me over! Rach. Pheebs.
joey See ya!! What the hell was that?!
monica Probably some y'know, European good-bye thing he picked up in London.
rachel That's not European!
phoebe Well, it felt French.
rachel Oh God, I really had a good time!
dave Yeah, me too. So, I guess this is it.
rachel Yeah. Umm, unless you wanna come inside?
dave Yeah!
rachel Okay. Oh, uh, wait a minute, y'know what? I uh, I can't decide this. Umm, okay, just hold on a second.
dave Okay, yeah!
rachel Umm, hi!
ross Hi.
rachel Is Monica around? I-I have to ask her something.
ross She's doing her laundry.
rachel What's that?
ross It came in the mail today, it's uh, 72 long-stemmed red roses, one for each day that I've known and loved Emily, cut up into mulch!
rachel Oh, honey that's awful.
ross Oh, it's not so bad. Monica's gonna make potpourri! I think I'm gonna go wander out in the rain for a while.
rachel But, it's not raining.
ross I can't catch a break!
rachel Y'know what Ross? You're not going anywhere. You're gonna sit right here. I'm gonna make you a cup of tea and we're gonna talk this thing whole out. All right? Hey, Dave!
dave Yeah?
rachel Umm, listen, I'm gonna need to take a rain check, my roommate is just really sick. Okay? Bye! Honey, listen, I know, I know things seem so bad right now.
monica Rach? Can I talk to for just a minute? I-I dropped some socks.
rachel Yeah.
monica What is the matter with you?! Do you want to fall into the trap? Do you want to fall into the trap?!
rachel Ohh! You did not drop any socks!
monica I just ran into Dave and he told me that you blew him off! I mean, you listen to me! Now, I'm calling the shots! I say you leave Ross alone and go get Dave! What the hell were you trying to do?
rachel Well, ultimately, I was trying y'know, I-I wanted...tell him y'know, that I'm still in love with him.
monica What?!! You cannot tell him that!!
rachel Why? Why not?! People love to hear that!
monica I make the decisions, and I say no.
rachel Well, y'know what, no, you do not make my decisions because y'know what, you're fired.
monica You can't fire me. I make your decisions and I say, "I'm not fired!" Ha!
rachel Well
monica Rachel!! Come on! Let me in!
joey Havin' some trouble?
monica Rachel locked the door.
joey I'll kick that door in if you give me a little sugar.
monica Rachel! Let me in! Rachel!
monica Thank you. Rachel, can I talk to you outside for a sec?
rachel No.
monica I really need to talk to you.
rachel Well, then talk!
monica Okay, I will. Remember that thing that we just discussed that you wanted to do?
rachel Yes!
ross What thing?
monica Well, Rachel wants to take swing dance lessons. Which I think is a really stupid idea! It's dangerous, she's never gonna get what she wants, and who knows who she might end up hurting.
ross Monica's right, swing dancing can be tricky. I'm gonna use the phone. I gotta cancel those five giant teddy bears I sent to Emily. My God, think of the massacre.
rachel I'm gonna do it.
monica All right, Rachel, I know-I know you think I'm crazy, please, before you tell him you love him, just-just try to find one person who thinks this is a good idea. Because I bet you, you can't.
rachel But I
monica Please!
rachel All right, fine.
monica Joey, I'm in!
joey All right. Good deal.
all Pheebs! Hey Pheebs!
joey Uh, okay, Pheebs?
phoebe Yeah?
joey Umm, y'know how the other day you were talking about how you didn't get to go to London and how you were kinda feeling left out?
phoebe Yeah?
joey All right, well, we felt really bad about that so we decided we should all take a little trip together!
phoebe Ohh, that's so nice! How great! Well, where? Where's the trip?!
monica Well, we thought we would all go to a picnic , in Central Park!
phoebe Central... Park!
joey Yeah, all of us! All day!
phoebe That sucks! That's not a trip! I just came from the park! What are we gonna high five about at the stupid Central Park? "Well, it's right by my house, all right!"
chandler Well, I'm gonna go home and bask in the triumph of my Central Park idea.
rachel Hey-whoa-whoa-whoa!! Ho-ho-hold on a sec there, Mr. Kissey! Y'know, I've been meaning to talk to you about this whole, little, new European thing you got going on, and I just need to tell you that it makes me very uncomfortable and I just-y'know-stop it!
chandler I was just trying to bring a little culture to the group.
phoebe That's fine, just don't bring it in my mouth.
monica Makes me wanna puke!
ross Hey everybody, Pheebs is here!
joey Phoebe!
chandler Hey, Pheebs!
rachel Phoebe, woo!
phoebe Okay, woo! Hi.
chandler Okay, Pheebs, we decided the picnic idea was a little... Y'know, it didn't have any... It-it, well it blew. So, we thought, that this afternoon that we would all go away for the whole weekend to, Atlantic City!
phoebe Ooh, Atlantic City! Oh, that's a great plan! Who's plan was that?
joey Mine!
ross Wait! It was my plan.
joey Nooo, I said we needed a new plan.
ross And, I came up with Atlantic City.
joey Which, is the new plan!
monica Okay, well, why don't we all meet upstairs in an hour?
phoebe Okay! Ooh-ahh, I'm gonna go pack. I'm gonna go pack my ass off!
monica Come on Rach, let's go.
rachel Yeah, y'know what? I'm-I'm gonna meet you upstairs in a minute.
monica No! Rachel, you didn't find anyone so you can't tell him.
rachel Well, y'know what, that doesn't matter.
monica Okay, Rachel, do you have any idea how painful it is to tell someone that you love them and not have them say it back?
rachel Yeah, I-I don't care.
monica Okay. I-I can't watch.
rachel What 'cha readin'?
ross The paper.
rachel Yeah, what's it about?
ross Events from around the globe.
rachel Okay. Uhh, Ross, y'know what, there's something that I-that I have to talk to you about and everybody's saying that I shouldn't tell you, but I think they're wrong. I mean, and you know how people can be wrong.
ross Sure. Once, at work I-I thought carbon dating was fossilized
rachel Okay, Ross, I'm really trying to tell you something here.
ross Yeah.
rachel Okay.
ross Go ahead.
rachel Umm, okay, I think I'm-I'm just gonna-just gonna say it. Just gonna say it. Uhh, I'm still in love with you Ross.
ross Wow. Umm... Huh... I'm-I'm not sure what to do with that right now.
ross What? What? Was that a joke? 'Cause it's mean.
rachel I'm so dead serious. I'm totally serious.
ross Why are you laughing?
rachel Because , because, I just heard it. I heard it, and it's ridiculous! I mean, you're married. You're-you're married and it's just ridiculous, and it's like, it's like when said it, I sort of like, I floated up out of my body, y'know? And, and-and then I heard myself say it and then the floating Rachel was like, "You are such an idiot!"
ross Well, well I am married. Even though I haven't spoken to my wife since the wedding.
rachel I'm sorry, that's not funny.
ross Actually, it kinda is. My wife won't return my calls. I don't know where my wife is. "Hey Ross, where's the Mrs.?" Don't know!
rachel Oh God, ohh, okay, y'know what, do you think ah, do you think that you just forget that I told you this?
ross Well, I kinda half to. I mean, because the thing is
rachel The thing is y'know, that you're married to Emily.
ross That is what the thing is.
rachel Ross, things aren't gonna be weird between us, right? I mean was that just the stupidest thing, me telling you that?
ross No. No. No, I'm-I'm glad you did. Look, if nothing else, it's-it's always great when someone tells you they love you.
rachel That's what I said! Thank you for being so nice.
ross No thank you for... Thank you.
ross Okay, let's go!
chandler Atlantic City!
phoebe Atlantic City, baby! Let's roll some bones! Hey Joey, high-five for rolling bones!
joey Uh, Pheebs, you're leaking?
monica Oh my God! You're water broke!
the_guys Ohh!
phoebe All right. Well, don't worry, I call shotgun!
all Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Wait-wait!
chandler Pheebs! We have to take you to the hospital now!
ross Pheebs, Pheebs, the babies are coming now.
rachel High-five, the babies are coming!
phoebe Wait, wait, remember when my water broke?
monica I can't believe Phoebe's gonna have her babies!
chandler I know, it's beautiful. Amazing.
chandler Y'know what else I can't believe? I had to kiss Phoebe and Rachel every time I left a room, I mean it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.
monica Do you know anything about women?
chandler No.
monica That's all right.
chandler Okay.
