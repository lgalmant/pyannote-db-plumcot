gunther You don't need to fill these silences.
chandler_bing Oh, okay, thanks.
monica_geller Chandler, that's like your fourth cup of coffee!
chandler_bing Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because I'm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!
monica_geller He's in a different room! He's really that loud?
joey_tribbiani Oh, you should here me.
chandler_bing It's not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!
joey_tribbiani Look, I told ya, I'm not going to any clinic! I don't have a problem, you're the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!
chandler_bing They don't have those.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, you've just had your first class!
monica_geller Y'know I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me over
joey_tribbiani Ohhh, yeah!
monica_geller He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.
chandler_bing Next time you snore, I'm rolling ya over!
joey_tribbiani I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.

joey_tribbiani Yeah, Rach, I think you're handling that really well.
rachel_green Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? There's nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua. Y'know, they're not gonna get married anyway!
chandler_bing What?
rachel_green Come on! They rushed into this thing so fast it's ridiculous! I mean, they're gonna be engaged for like what? A year? And somewhere along the way, one of them is gonna realise what they've done and they're call the whole thing off. I'm telling ya, you're gonna be dancing at my wedding before you're dancing at there's.
chandler_bing Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.
rachel_green Why not?

rachel_green Well, that's great.
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Yeah, Emily always wanted to get married in this beautiful place that her parents got married, but it's going to be torn down, so... I mean, I-I know it's crazy, but everything up 'til now has been so crazy, and I don't know, this just feels right. Y'know?
joey_tribbiani Hey! That's the day after I stop menstruating! This isn't mine.

rachel_green Yeah-yeah, y'know if-if there was just like one little area where I-that I think we need-we would need to work on; I-I would think it was we're just not crazy enough!
joshua_burgin I-I gotta say, I-I-I-I'm not too sure I agree with that.
rachel_green Well, yeah, right, y'know what? Yeah, you're right, I mean, we no, we have our fun. Yeah! But if.....I mean, I mean like craaaazy! Y'know? Okay, all right. This is gonna, this is gonna sound y'know, a little umm, hasty, but uh, just go with it. Umm. Ugh. What if we got married?
joshua_burgin What?!
rachel_green Oh, I know, I know, it's-it's so, it's so totally like, "Whoa! Can we do this?" Y'know, I mean, but I mean it just feels right! Don't you think? It does! I mean, it just feels right, don't you think?
joshua_burgin Wow! Uhh, Rachel uhh, you're a real special lady, but my divorce isn't final yet and, and, and we've been on four days, so I'm thinking "No, but thanks."

phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller That was a terrible throw!!
phoebe_buffay I'm not gonna right to you! That's not real!
monica_geller Look at me! My big concern is what's real?! Oh my God. We're really sad, aren't we?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I think we are.
monica_geller This isn't even my dress.
phoebe_buffay Well, at least you didn't rent yours from a store called, "It's Not Too Late."
monica_geller I'm changing out of this.
phoebe_buffay Me too.
monica_geller In like a half-hour?
phoebe_buffay Me too.
monica_geller Okay, throw it straight this time.
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller I'm getting married next!!
phoebe_buffay Yay!
phoebe_buffay I hate my regular clothes now! Y'know? I look down and-and I know that this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.
monica_geller Yeah. I mean it was kinda fun for a while, but didn't you start feeling silly?
phoebe_buffay I guess.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!
monica_geller Oh God.
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're such a cheater!
chandler_bing Hello! Little ones.
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller So, is Joey gonna stop snoring?
chandler_bing Yep! And! A beautiful woman agreed to go out with me. Joey wanted to ask her out, but uh, she picked me.
phoebe_buffay Oh, how'd that happen?
chandler_bing Because I'm cooler.
monica_geller No, seriously.
chandler_bing Well she's, she's the kinda girl-Joey was unconscious.
joey_tribbiani Hey you guys! What's happening?
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay What is that?
joey_tribbiani Oh, they gave it to me at the sleep clinic, and it's gonna help me not to snore.
monica_geller Well, are you asleep right now, Joe? 'Cause I don't think you have to wear it unless you are!
joey_tribbiani I know I don't have too! It tastes good.
chandler_bing Plus, you look cool.
rachel_green Well, I just called Joshua
phoebe_buffay Oh, how did it go?
rachel_green Well, I did my best to convince him that I'm not some crazy girl who is dying to get married-I'm just going through a hard time.
phoebe_buffay What did he say?
rachel_green Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.
monica_geller Ohh, sweetie! Hey, I bet you anything that he's gonna call you again.
rachel_green Yeah, maybe, but I don't think I even care. I don't think he's the one I'm sad about. Y'know, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I don't think I'm handling it all that well.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, maybe.
rachel_green And I-I am just trying to figure out why.
phoebe_buffay Any luck?
rachel_green Well, yeah, y'know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again? I guess I just figured that somewhere down the road, we would be on again.
monica_geller Again. Y'know what? I think we all did.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller So, I got us some reservations for Sunday night, okay? How about, Ernie's at 9 o'clock?
rachel_green Yeah, well, you uh, better make it for three.
dr_ross_geller Oh, see I-I don't know if we're gonna be hungry at three.
rachel_green Three people. Joshua's not gonna be there.
dr_ross_geller What happened?
rachel_green Uh, well, I think, I think he broke up with me.
dr_ross_geller Noo. Why?
rachel_green Well, apparently he scares easy.
dr_ross_geller Oh, Rachel, I'm-I'm sorry.
rachel_green It's okay. Sometimes, things don't work out the way you'd thought they would.
dr_ross_geller Come here.
rachel_green Oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up Emily?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller You okay?
rachel_green Yeah! I got my girls.
rachel_green Ugh.
phoebe_buffay Hey, y'know what might cheer you up?
rachel_green What?
rachel_green Y'know, I gotta tell ya, this really does put in a better mood.
monica_geller Oh, I wish there was a job where I could wear this all the time. Maybe someday, there will be.
monica_geller Oh God! He's gonna come by and borrow some candles for his big date!
rachel_green Oh, okay!
monica_geller No-no, Rachel, don't get it! He can't see us!
phoebe_buffay No, yeah! The groom cannot see the bride!
rachel_green I'm not gonna marry Chandler!
phoebe_buffay Not after this!
rachel_green Okay, you guys, just relax. I doooo.
joshua_burgin I gotta go.
rachel_green Oh, wait, Joshua! Joshua! Yeah, well, that oughta do it.
joey_tribbiani Dude! I am trying to sleep!
