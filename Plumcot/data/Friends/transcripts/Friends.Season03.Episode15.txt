phoebe_buffay Anyway, I'm going out with Sergei again tonight, and um, could you come and be the translator's date? So that when we, it's time for our alone time, you two could split off. Y'know, he's really, he's kinda cute.

joey_tribbiani Dude, I don't know.
chandler_bing She was kidding.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing She was.... But y'know what, just in case, maybe we should come up with a set of ground rules.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, for sure. Okay. Probably want the first thing to be, never open your eyes. Y'know, because you don't want to be doing something and then look up and see something you don't want to be seeing.
chandler_bing Yeah. Good call, nice one. Hold it!! Hold it! What if me eyes are closed, and, and my hand is out there....
joey_tribbiani Ah!! Okay! Eyes open at all times! Oh, hey, how do we decide where we... y'know each would, y'know be?
chandler_bing Right. Right. Well ah, y'know we could flip for it.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I guess, but what's like heads and what's tails?
chandler_bing Well it you don't know that, then I don't want to do this with you.
rachel_green No, no, no, I'm looking at a purchase order right here and it clearly states that we ordered the Rivera bikini in a variety of sizes and colours. And.... What does it matter, what I'm wearing?! Can I please speak to your supervisor? Thank you. We're holding.
dr_ross_geller Hi!
rachel_green Oh!! My God, what are you doing here?
dr_ross_geller Well you said you couldn't go out so....

dr_ross_geller Yeah, but I got cous-cous!
rachel_green Honey, honey, I'm sorry, I know it's our anniversary but I told you on the phone I don't have time to stop.
dr_ross_geller Okay, you don't have to stop, I'm invisible, I'm not here.
rachel_green But I don't, hmm... Oh, who approved that order?! Well there is no Mark Robbinson in this office. Get me Mark on the phone!
sophie I love Mark. Do you know Mark?
dr_ross_geller Yeah!!
rachel_green Well, let me just check that with what I got here, all right see 038 is not the number for this store, 038 is Atlanta. And I...
dr_ross_geller Pepper?
rachel_green None for me.
dr_ross_geller Okay sorry, whew.
rachel_green I'm sorry, as I was saying the store number is wrong, and I'm sorry but that's... Oh my God!!
dr_ross_geller Okay, that's a fire. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
rachel_green Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to call you back, I've got a Schemp in my office. What are you doing?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry. But ah, hey, oh, somebody's off the phone, how 'bout a glass of wine by the fire, I could get it going again.
rachel_green Ross you're not listening to me, I don't have time to stop.
dr_ross_geller Come on Rach, you don't have what, ten minutes?
rachel_green I don't have ten minutes!!
dr_ross_geller What? Sophie, does she have ten minutes?
rachel_green Hey, Ross!!! I told you I don't!
dr_ross_geller Don't yell at me okay, this is the most I've seen you all week.
rachel_green Look, I cannot do this right now, okay, I've got a deadline, would you just go home, I'll talk to you later.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but wait...
rachel_green Good bye!
sophie Actually, that's our three hole punch.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hi. Look um, about what happened earlier...
dr_ross_geller No, hey, well, I-I completely understand. You were, you were stressed.
rachel_green I was gonna give you a chance to apologise to me.
dr_ross_geller For what? For letting you throw me out of your office?
rachel_green You had no right coming down to my office Ross. You do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work! Unless maybe they were a park ranger!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary, boy what an ass am I.
rachel_green But I told you, I didn't have the time!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well you never have the time. I mean, I don't feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore, Rachel.
rachel_green Wh, Ross what do you want from me? You want me, you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?
dr_ross_geller No, but it'd be nice if you realised, it's just a job!
rachel_green Just a job!
dr_ross_geller Yes.
rachel_green Ross do you realise this is the first time in my life I'm doing something I actually care about. This is the first time in my life I'm doing something that I'm actually good at. I mean. if you don't get that...
dr_ross_geller No, hey, I get that, okay, I get that big time. And I'm happy for ya, but I'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine! Okay, I don't know what to do anymore.
rachel_green Well neither do I!
dr_ross_geller Is this about Mark?
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller Okay, it's not, it's not.
rachel_green Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, Ross, no, you're, you're, you're making this too hard.
dr_ross_geller Oh I'm, I'm making this too hard. Okay, what do you want me to do.
rachel_green I don't know, I don't know. Urrrgh! Look, maybe we should take a break.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, fine, you're right. Let's ah, let's take a break, let's cool off, okay, let's get some frozen yogart, or something..
rachel_green No. A break from us.
chloe And the advances in collating in the past five years, I mean we just got in an X-5000, y'know. The X-5000 makes the X-50 look like a T-71.
chloe Hey, it's the dinosaur guy. Hi, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Oh, hi Chloe.
chloe I want you to met some friends of mine. This guy is my hero, he comes in with some stuff he wants it blown up 400%, we said we don't do that, and he says you gotta. And y'know what, we did it. And now anytime anybody wants 400, we just say 'let's Ross it!'
chandler_bing And that's the only colour that comes in.
isaac Yo, Chloe, do you have a quarter for the condom machine?
chloe Oh!
chandler_bing So, what are you doing here? I thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, little change in plans. Ahh, we're gonna break-up instead.
monica_geller Oh, and I can also speak a little French. Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir? Why? What did I say?
mischa Well, you just asked if I wanted to go to bed with you tonight.
monica_geller Oh my God! No wonder I get such great service at Cafe Maurice.
phoebe_buffay Knock, knock, knock, knock, hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei that um, I was fascinated by what Boutros Boutros Gali said in the New York Times.
phoebe_buffay You didn't say Boutros Boutros Gali.
mischa Boutros Boutros Gali.
mischa He says he was too.
phoebe_buffay Interesting.
mischa So I was wondering....
phoebe_buffay Okay, ah, before you get all talky again, umm, could you also please tell Sergei that I really like his suit.
mischa Eh, he said, thank you very much, he thinks you look very pretty tonight, your hair, golden like the sun. So you're a chef?
monica_geller I'm also thinking about opening up my own restaurant.
mischa Oh, really.
phoebe_buffay Monica, can I talk to you behind my menu, please. What are you doing?
monica_geller Well, I was having a conversation.
phoebe_buffay Yeah but, Mischa is so interested in you, that Sergei and I haven't been able to say two words to each other.
monica_geller What do you want me to do? Just sit here silently while you three have a conversation?
phoebe_buffay That would be great. Thank you.
rachel_green Hello!
mark_robinson Oh, hi. It's Mark.
rachel_green Oh.
mark_robinson What? Is it my breath?
rachel_green No! Sorry, I just thought you were somebody else. Hi!

rachel_green Yeah, I'm fine.
mark_robinson You wanna talk, I mean I can come over?
rachel_green No! Really, no, please, please, that's, that's okay.
mark_robinson All right, all right, I'm coming over, and I'm bringing Chinese food.
rachel_green Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not hungry.
mark_robinson It's for me.
rachel_green Oh. Okay, bye.
joey_tribbiani So what are you gonna do?
dr_ross_geller What can I do? One person wants to break-up, you break-up.
chandler_bing Hey, no way! Come on, this is you guys, call her and work it out.
dr_ross_geller Oh come on, we just had this huge fight, all right, don't I have to wait a while?
chandler_bing Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat, pick up the phone!!
chandler_bing Y'know that whole swimming thing is a myth.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.
chandler_bing Why? What happened to him?
joey_tribbiani Nothing, he's just really believes in that.
rachel_green Oh, and then, we got into this big, stupid fight. I just, it was awful. I told him he treats me like a park ranger, or something, oh and then I told him I wanted to take a break, I don't want to take a break.
mark_robinson Wow. I'm sorry. Eggroll?
rachel_green No. And then I called him, and he wasn't there.
mark_robinson Well, then he's, he's probably just, out.
rachel_green Oh, thank you that's very helpful, I'm glad you came over.
rachel_green Hello.
dr_ross_geller Hi! It's me.
rachel_green Hi! Oh, I'm so glad you called.
dr_ross_geller Really? I've been thinking, this is crazy, I mean don't, don't you think we can work on this?
mark_robinson Hey, what do you want to drink?
dr_ross_geller Who's that?
rachel_green Nobody.
mark_robinson Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?
dr_ross_geller Is that Mark?
rachel_green Umm, honey, look he just came over to....
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Got it!
chloe Hey, dinosaur guy, look at you, so sad. Come dance.
dr_ross_geller Ah, that's okay, thanks.
chloe Hey, you don't have to smile. You just have to dance.
dr_ross_geller Look, I don't feel like dancing, I feel like having a drink. Okay?
chloe Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.
mischa And the vet said it was time. And so from half a world away, while my Mother held the phone to his ear, I said good bye to my dog,. In seven languages.
monica_geller Oh. Can I have a tissue?
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah, sure. I just hope you, hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose and choke on it.
mischa Sergei, would like to apologise for my behaviour tonight.
phoebe_buffay Well, tell him, apology accepted.
mischa Oh, he's unbelievable. I mean for the first time in three years somebody wants to actually want to talk to me, but do you think he would let me enjoy that, no!! You silly diplomat, why don't you learn some English, Sergei?
phoebe_buffay Excuse me, but umm, isn't he paying for your dinner?
monica_geller Hey, the man's dog just died.
mischa I have just resigned my post. Would you care to accompany me to the Rainbow Room? I have diplomatic coupons.
monica_geller It will be my pleasure. My guy has diplomatic coupons. Your guy can't even say coupons.

rachel_green Oh, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home, be home. Be home. Be home, be home, be home. Oh, you're not home.
