nurse I'm sorry. Semi-private rooms are all we have.
rachel Okay. Just give us a second. Ross!
ross Yeah?

ross I really think they're out of rooms.
rachel They're not!! Ross, they're just saving them for the important people!! Okay?! What-what if I was the president?!
ross Well then we'd be in a lot of trouble, you don't know where any countries are. Okay. Uh, say would you umm... Would you mind checking again to see if any umm, private rooms may have opened up?
nurse This is a hospital.
rachel Okay. Y'know what? I'd have to say I really don't care for your tone. And this is not the only hospital in this city and we have no problem to - Whoa! Oh gosh! Whoa!
ross What-what?
rachel Ow! Ow! Contraction. Ow-ow! Ow-ow!

phoebe Sure! What?
monica Umm, this is going to be fun. Watch me freak out Chandler. Honey?
chandler Yeah?
monica Listen uh, I-I've been doing some thinking, and I don't know whether it's because we're here or Rachel's giving birth but umm, I think we should try to have a baby.
chandler Okay.
monica What-what-what's that now?!
chandler Okay. I've been thinking about it too, and I, I think we're ready.
monica What?! Are you kidding me?! You-you-you think we're ready to have a baby now?!
phoebe Oh, this is fun.
joey You're ready to have a baby? My boy's all grown up!
chandler But you said you were ready too.
monica Yeah but I was just screwing with you to try to get your voice all high and weird like mine is now!
chandler Yes, but haven't you wanted a kid like forever?
monica Okay, just back off mister! Whoa. 'Cause I am ready to have a baby. I just want Joey to be the father.
joey What?! Are you crazy?!
monica That's it! Right there! Is all I wanted!
marc I am so sorry. The doctor insisted on closing the curtain for the exam.
rachel Oh, that's very - Really very-very okay.
marc Julie's cervix is dilated a seven centimeters, that's about four fingers. The doctor let me feel it myself.
julie Have you felt Rachel's cervix Ross?
rachel No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
ross We're not gonna do that.
julie Well, if you like you can feel Rachel's and then feel mine to compare.
mrs_geller Am I interrupting?
ross Uh yes! Thank you.
rachel Oh. Oh wait no.
ross Later.
rachel No-no-don't! Don't leave me here with these people.
ross Oh uh, I'm sorry.
rachel No Ross! Ross! Ross! My child has no father!
ross Hi! I'm so glad you're here, but it's gonna be a while. I-I wished you'd called first.
mrs_geller Oh that's all right, I'm coming back later with your father.
ross Oh good.
mrs_geller I actually needed to talk to you before the birth.
ross Okay, what's up?
mrs_geller I brought something that I want to give you, assuming of course that you want it.
ross Ma, you're asking me to marry you?
mrs_geller This is your grandmother's engagement ring, I want you to give it to Rachel.
ross Mom no, come on! Thank you.
mrs_geller Just hear me out!
ross N-no! Okay? We've been through this! We're not gonna get married just because she's pregnant, okay?
mrs_geller Honestly! Ross, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped. A child should have a family.
ross Mom, y'know what? I-I can't deal with this right now. I'm sorry
mrs_geller Just... think about it. If you don't, I'll talk more about humping.
ross Gimmie!
rachel Hi!
mrs_geller Oh hi dear!
rachel Oh, thank you so much for coming. Ross, get in here!
ross she came and dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why I'm not with Rachel.
phoebe Yeah. Why aren't you with Rachel?
ross Are you kidding? Look, we're not gonna be together just because we're having a baby. Okay?
phoebe But y'know what? It just seems that you two belong together.
ross Okay, stop it! I can't deal with this right now. I have to go have a baby.
phoebe Right. And with who again?
joey God. He's crazy! Why doesn't he want to be with Rachel?
phoebe I know!
joey I mean seriously, she's like the perfect woman. I mean I know she turned me down, but if she hadn't and wanted to be with me, I would take her in my arms and... I haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while have I?
ross Hey. Who's that?
rachel New people.
ross What happened to the Disgustingtons?
rachel They're having their baby! It's not fair Ross we got here first! Right after you left they wheeled her off into delivery. Oh but not before she gave me a juicy shot of little Jamie just crowning away.
ross Wow! Sorry. So uh, how are the new people?
rachel Well they have uh, some unusual pet names for each other. Including umm, evil bitch and uh, sick bastard. Oh God oh! Contraction!
ross Yeah? Okay.
rachel Ooh! Ow!!
evil_bitch Are you looking at her?!
sick_bastard No!
evil_bitch Don't you look at her you sick bastard!
sick_bastard Honey I swear! I wasn't looking at her!
evil_bitch She's in labor! You like that you sick son of a bitch!
ross Umm. Umm, I'm-I'm just gonna - 
evil_bitch See? See? It was because you were looking fat pervert!
ross No-no, I'm... I'm sure no one was looking. Just want some privacy.
evil_bitch You miss your girlfriend?
ross Just ignore them.
rachel Ross.
ross What? What?
rachel He's looking at me.
ross Hey! You wanna live to see your baby?!
evil_bitch Don't you talk to my husband like that you stupid bastard!
monica Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
monica What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
chandler I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
monica What?
chandler Look, we've always talked about having babies someday. I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it. We're good. We're really good.
monica We are pretty good.
chandler But nothing has to happen until your ready.
monica Well maybe I'm ready now. I mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.
chandler What?! It's not right! We're not ready to have a kid now!!
monica What?!!
chandler I'm kidding. This is going to be fun.
monica So we're gonna try? I mean, are we trying?
chandler We're trying to get pregnant. Y'know I'm not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies. So, when do you want to start trying?
monica Okay, hold on a sec.
chandler Period math?
monica Yeah.
chandler Yeah.
monica Well, we could start trying. Now.
chandler Right here?
monica No, not here. Maybe here.
chandler Wait a minute, it's perfect. We got a lot of time to kill and we're in a building that's full of beds!
monica And it's so clean!!
joey Come on you stupid machine! Come on!
phoebe Oh, it ate your money?
joey No.
phoebe All right, I'll see you downstairs then.
joey All right.
phoebe All right.
joey Hey I got one! I got one!
man Hi!
phoebe Hi.
man Oh uh, up or down?
phoebe Oh down please. I-I hate to be a ball buster can I just do it?
man Could you press up too please?
phoebe Sure! I feel so bad for you; I broke my leg once too.
man Oh yeah? How'd yours happen?
phoebe Well, it's a long story. It's kind of embarrassing. Let's just say there was a typographical error with a sex manual. How about you?
man Car accident.
phoebe Oh.
man Oh, let me guess some idiot on a cell phone wasn't paying attention?
man Yeah. Me. Oh hey, that's me. Hey uh, I take it you're just visiting someone.
phoebe Uh-huh, yeah.
man Well umm, if you have sometime y'know and maybe you might want to visit someone else
phoebe Oh yeah! I-I would like that.
man I'm in the middle
phoebe Wait! What?! No!! Elevator!! No!
joey Uh, you gotta press the button.
ross The nurse said they're bringing in another woman.
rachel Ugh, is she pregnant yet? She doesn't need to be; she'll still have the baby before I do. Oh Ross, another contraction!
ross That's it. That's it.
woman Oooh, that sounded like a bad one.
rachel Yeah it was.
woman Mine haven't been so bad. Oh! Here comes one now. Oh, that was a big one!
phoebe Excuse me? Could you help me with something? The patient I'm looking for has a broken leg and is in a wheelchair. And umm, he's like early to mid-thirties, very attractive.
nurse I think I know who you're talking about.
phoebe Oh yay! Great! Okay, what room number is he in?
nurse I'm sorry, that information is restricted to hospital staff
joey Uh, she's with me. Dr. Drake Remoray.
nurse Dr. Drake who?
joey Remoray. It's Portuguese. We need that information; I'm a doctor.
nurse A doctor at this hospital?
joey Damnit woman we're losing precious time! Now do you want this man's blood on your head?
phoebe Hands.
joey Hands! It is absolutely essential that you tell me what room the man my assistant described is staying in. He's a patient of mine, I've been treating him for years!
nurse He's in room 816.
joey 816, thank you!
phoebe Thank you.
joey And what is his name?
phoebe No!
monica I think we found a place.
chandler Okay.
monica Umm, wait! Do you want to set the mood a little?
chandler Okay. Uh, we'll dim the lights, dim the lights. Or turn them out all together. Uh, no scented candles. Okay here. Here we go.
monica Okay! Okay! Make me sterile, but okay.
monica Okay. Let's hurry - Oh wait! Do we have a condom? Oh right!
chandler Yes, 98.6. You're gonna be fine.
phoebe Ooh, this is it! Oh, that's him! That's him!
joey Great! Go get him.
phoebe Wait a second, or maybe you can go in first.
joey He's not really my type.
phoebe No not you, Dr. Drake Remoray. You can ask him questions and see what's he like. People tell doctors everything.
joey But you said he was this great guy!
phoebe But lately all the guys I meet seem really nice at first, then they turn out to be the biggest jerks.
joey You do attract some stinkers.
rachel Dr. Long, I've been at this for seventeen hours! Three women have come and gone with their babies, you gotta give me some good news! How many centimeters am I dilated? Eight? Nine?
dr_long Three.
ross Just three?! I'm dilated three!
dr_long We are moving along, just slowly. Don't worry, you're doing great. I'll be back soon.
rachel Hey, y'know what? I'm not waiting! I'm gonna push this baby out! I'm doing it! I mean it's what? Three centimeters? That's gotta be like this!
ross Actually it's more like this.
rachel Oh stupid metric system!
doctor Oh my. We're gonna need to take you straight to the delivery room.
rachel Oh for the love of God!
woman_giving_birth It's coming! It's coming!
doctor And here it is!
rachel Oh come on!!
joey Hi! I'm Dr. Drake Remoray and I have a few routine questions I need to ask you.
man Really? I've been dealing with Dr. Wells.
joey I know, but I'm a neurologist. And just to be on the safe side, Dr. Wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me.
man Dr. Wells is a woman.
joey That was a test. Good response. All right, full name.
man Clifford Burnett.
joey Date of birth?
cliff November 16th, 1968.
joey Age?
cliff Can't you figure that out based on my date of birth?
joey I'm a doctor Cliff, not a mathematician.
cliff I'm 33.
joey Okay. And uh, are you married.
cliff No.
joey Oh really? So, 33 and still single, would you say you have commitment issues?
cliff Are all the questions this personal?
joey Yes.
cliff Well uh if you must know I'm a widower.
joey Oh that's terrible. I'm-I'm really sorry.
cliff Yeah.
joey Hmm. Do you sleep with women and never call them again?
cliff No.
joey Excellent! Excellent! And uh, finally, are you into any weird stuff y'know, sexually?
cliff No!
joey Oooh, wrong answer.
nurse This room's available.
rachel Okay! Okay wait! You listen to me! You listen to me! Since I have been waiting four women, that's four, one higher than the number of centimeters that I am dilated, have come and gone with their babies! I'm next! It's my turn! It's only fair! And if you bring in one woman and she has her baby before me I'm going to sue you! Not this hospital, I'm going to sue you! And my husband he's a lawyer!
ross Uh Rach
rachel Go get back on that case honey!
nurse I don't think the next patient is very far along.
rachel Okay, well then bring her in.
woman OH... .MY... .GAWD!!!
janice I... .can't... .believe this!
ross And yet somehow it's true!
janice I mean this is so great! We're gonna be baby buddies!
ross Squeeze your legs together and cover the baby's ears!
man Hi sweetie!
janice Hi! Hi sweetheart! This is my husband Sid, I don't think you've met him. Ross, Rachel, this is Sid. I nabbed him a year ago at the dermatologist's office. Thank God for adult acne huh?
sid I still can't believe it! I'm the luckiest guy in the world!
ross Really?
sid What'd he say?
janice Oh y'know what? You have to speak very loudly when you're talking to Sid, because he's almost completely deaf.
rachel Oh!
ross Oh there you go!
rachel I get it!
janice So? Congratulations you two, I didn't even know you got married.
rachel Oh we-we didn't.
ross No-no. We
janice What?!
ross Um uh... We're-we're just having this baby together but uh, uh that's all.
janice Why?!!
ross Uh well umm... we're just not in that place, y'know? But we're very excited about this.
janice Oh. Well then shut me up.
rachel Just tell me how.
janice Uh-oh, I feel another one coming.
ross Sid you lucky deaf bastard.
phoebe What else? What else?
joey Uh, well he's 33.
phoebe Oh. Ah-uh.
joey A widower.
phoebe Oh.
joey He seemed like a stand up guy. Oh, and he's not into anything weird sexually.
phoebe Enter Pheebs.
chandler Should we tell Rachel there's an empty private room right next door to hers?
monica We could, or we can have sex in it.
chandler Well let me think about that, while I remove my pants!
monica Okay mister! Fertilize me!
monica Does that sound like Janice?
chandler If it's not, then there's two of them. And that would mean it's the end of the world!
monica Hey!
ross Hey!
chandler Hi.
rachel Oh hi.
monica I can't believe this is taking so long. How are you doing?
rachel Oh not bad. Do you know that feeling when you're trying to blow a Saint Bernard out your ass?
chandler Weirdest thing. Did I hear - - Mother of God it's true!
janice Chandler Bing!
chandler Jan-Janice!
ross Not just Janice, Janice in labor, contracting and everything.
janice Oh, this should be easy. I have a very wide pelvis. You remember Chandler.
chandler Janice I didn't even know you were pregnant! Who's the unwitting human who's essence you've stolen?
janice It's you. This is yours.
chandler What?!
janice Look how nervous he gets! We haven't slept together in years!
chandler That's funny. Does it-does it hurt? Does the labor hurt?
phoebe Okay I've got one for you, if you had too which one would you rather eat, a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?
cliff I'd have to say... the talking gorilla, because at least I can explain to him that you're making me eat him.
phoebe Somebody went to college. Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.
cliff No, I'm sorry. It's just my foot itches like crazy.
phoebe Oh, I'll get it.
cliff Wow! I usually get to know a girl a little better before I let her spoon me.
phoebe Relax, it's not like we're forking.
rachel Oh that's five Ross. Five women have had five babies! And I have had no babies! Why doesn't she want to come out?
ross Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave.
rachel Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God!
dr_long Twenty-one hours, you're a hero.
rachel Doctor you gotta do something! I think you gotta give me drugs or you gotta light a fire up in there and just smoke it out.
dr_long Actually, I think you're ready to go to the delivery room.
rachel What?
dr_long Ten centimeters, you're about to become a mom.
rachel My God. Okay. Ha-ha-ha beat ya! Sucker!
cliff Is this the same spoon that was in my cast?
phoebe Y'know what? This one is.
cliff Oh my God! That's the doctor who was in my room before!
phoebe Huh. Okay, Mr. Perkazet.
cliff I'm telling you! The guy from that show was here in my room, asking me all these weird questions!
phoebe Cliff, do you really believe that a character from a TV show was here in your room?
joey Rachel's having her baby!! Which is of no interest to me, I'm a neurologist.
cliff That-that's him! You know him?
phoebe Okay. Okay. I - Okay umm... this... I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y'know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I'm coming off right now.
cliff I don't believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?
joey Fake? Excuse me? Hello?
cliff And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.
phoebe You're right, that was wrong. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?
cliff I don't think so.
joey Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!
phoebe Uh Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
joey Right!
phoebe Umm, look we don't, we don't really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don't know about you but that doesn't happen to me a lot.
cliff It doesn't happen to me either.
joey Me neither.
dr_long Push. Push. Come on push for five seconds. 5... 4
rachel 3-2-1 oh!!
dr_long Okay, the next contraction should be in about twenty seconds.
rachel I can't. I can't push anymore, I can't.
ross Sweetie you're doing great.
rachel Oh God twenty seconds my ass!!
dr_long Here we go! Okay, keep pushing! Wait! I see something.
ross What? You do? You do? Oh my God!
rachel Don't say, "Oh my God!" Oh my God what?
ross What is that?
dr_long It's the baby's buttock, she's breech.
ross Oh thank God, I thought she had two heads.
rachel Oh God. Is she gonna be okay?
dr_long She's gonna be fine. Okay, she's in a more difficult position so you're gonna have to push even harder now. Go! Push!
ross Go!
dr_long Rachel you're gonna have to push even harder, nothing's happening!
rachel I'm sorry, I can't!
ross Yes you can!
rachel I can't!
ross Hey! Hey! Come on! You can! I know you can do this! Let's go!
rachel I can't. Please, you do it for me.
ross No! Come on let's - One more time! One final push! Ready? 1... 2... 3!
dr_long Good!
ross Keep pushing!
rachel Are you okay?
ross You have no idea how much this hurts. Keep going! Keep going!
dr_long Here we go!
ross Oh! Oh! She's upside down but she's coming! She's coming!
rachel Oh God!
ross Oh! Oh my God oh! Oh my God she's here.
ross Oh she's... she's perfect.
rachel Oh, she's so tiny. Where'd she go?
ross Oh it's okay. They're just-they're just wrapping her up.
rachel Okay. Well be careful with her, she's really tiny.
dr_long Here she is!
rachel Oh hey you. Thanks for coming out of me. I know. Oh. Yeah. Oh, she's looking at me. Hi! I know you.
dr_long Do we have a name yet?
rachel No, not yet.
dr_long That's fine, for now we'll just call her Baby Girl Green.
rachel Oh no, Baby Girl Geller-Green.
rachel Hello baby girl.
phoebe Can we come in?
ross Oh, come in.
phoebe Hi!
joey There she is!
phoebe Oh, she's so beautiful.
rachel Here.
monica Oh my God! She's amazing. Oh, oh I'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex!
chandler It's incredible, I mean one minute she's inside you and then 47 hours later here she is.
joey She looks so real! Y'know what I mean! She's this whole tiny little person. She already has eyelashes and knees and... uh-oh.
rachel What?
joey Oh no-no, no for I second there I counted six fingers, but one was from the other hand so we're good.
phoebe Okay, my turn. My turn. Oh! You're so cute! Oh, I could squeeze your little head! I won't.
monica What's the matter?
rachel Oh nothing I... Sorry, I just can't stop crying.
ross The doctor says it's completely normal with all the hormones. Plus, you-you're sleep deprived.
rachel So? You guys are all sleep deprived. I don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet. Oh God.
joey What's the matter now?
rachel I was reliving it.
phoebe Ohhh.
chandler So, do you know what you're gonna call her yet?
phoebe Oh, wait a minute it's not gonna be Baby Girl? I thought that was so original!
ross Uh actually, we-we've narrowed it down to two names.
rachel Yeah, and y'know what? I love them both, so why don't you just pick one and that'll be it.
ross Wow! Umm, okay uh... everyone... this... is Isabella. What?
rachel That's not her name! I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an Isabella.
chandler So then I guess Ferdinad is out.
joey What was the other one Ross?
ross Umm, Delilah.
rachel Oh great! Suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.
ross So I guess we're back to uh, Baby Girl.
phoebe Yay!
rachel Well what are we going to do?
monica It's okay honey, you'll find a name.
ross Ugh, easy for you to say, you already know what your kids names are going to be.
chandler You do?
monica Yeah, I've had them picked out since I was fourteen.
chandler Oh no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good isn't it?
rachel Well tell us! What are they?
monica Umm, okay. If it's a boy it's Daniel.
rachel And if it's a girl?
monica I don't want to say.
rachel Oh, just tell us! We're not gonna want it!
monica Okay. It's Emma.
rachel Emma! See? I don't want it.
monica Take it.
rachel What?
monica It's clearly an Emma.
rachel Oh honey, but you love that name.
monica Yeah, but I love you more. Besides y'know, nothing goes with Bing. So I'm screwed. I mean... Oh, hi Emma. Yeah, that's you. You're our little Em. Oh what's that honey? What? Oh, you want a little cousin? You want a cousin right now?!
chandler That was amazing.
monica I know. Hey, do you realize we may have just changed our lives forever? We may have just started a family. Nine months from now we can be here, having our own baby.
chandler And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
janice Yoo-hoo! Aaron Litman-Neurolic would like to say hello to his future bride.
rachel Ohhh! Wow! He kinda takes your breath away doesn't he?
janice He's a keeper. How are you feeling?
rachel Oh, I'm fine.
janice Can I just say, I really admire what you're doing. Just raising her all alone.
rachel Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.
janice Oh, sure. Now. But what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?
rachel Well then he gets a divorce, it's Ross!
janice I'm telling you Rachel, listen to Janice. They all say they're gonna be there until they start their real family.
rachel Well I - That's never gonna happen with Ross.
janice Oh well that's what I thought about my first husband, now I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father and the twins and little Ms. New Boobs.
rachel Really?
janice I hate to be the one to say it, but honey you two are on your own.
rachel Well... That's... y'know - That's - We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I - Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I - things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the... the beginning of something.
ross Hey Janice!
janice Oh hi!
ross Who's this little guy?
janice Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
ross No-no. No.
janice I'm gonna leave the three of you alone.
ross Okay.
janice Bye.
ross Man! Did you see the kid on that nose?
rachel Uh-huh. Y'know what I was, I was thinking about?
ross Huh?
rachel Umm... that kiss before we left the apartment. That was some-something huh?
ross Yeah. Yeah, it really was. But we... we gotta be careful. We... we can't let that happen again, y'know?
rachel Right.
ross I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?
rachel No! No, of course not. No. That's why I brought it up. They didn't have any sodas?
ross Oh my God! I'm sorry, I was talking to this nurse, completely forgot.
rachel That's all right. And so it begins.
phoebe Is she in there?
ross Yeah. She's putting her down now, that's her.
phoebe Oh!
ross Look at Emma!
phoebe I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?
ross Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.
phoebe I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.
ross It's... it's complicated okay?
phoebe Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.
ross Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out... I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything - Oh that's... now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.
phoebe I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.
ross Yeah, exactly.
phoebe Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
joey Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?
rachel Nothing.
joey What is it? Hey!
rachel Really it's nothing. I'm just
joey Rach come on, what?
rachel I've just been thinking about how my baby and I are gonna be all alone.
joey What are you talking about alone? What about Ross?
rachel Oh please, he'll be with his real family, the twins and little miss new boobs.
joey Okay, how long was I watching that woman?
rachel I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and... he's gonna have his own life. Right?
joey Yeah, I guess so.
rachel I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?
joey Hey, listen to me, listen to me... you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.
rachel Joey. Honey what would I do without you?
joey You don't have to worry about that okay?
rachel Oh, hon can you grab me my other box of tissues? They're right on that chair under Ross's coat.
joey Sure.
rachel Okay.
joey My God.
rachel Joey.
rachel Oh my God. Okay.
