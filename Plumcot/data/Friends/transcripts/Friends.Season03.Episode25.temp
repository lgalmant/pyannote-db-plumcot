chandler So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?!
bonnie All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don't know, we were, we were making out.
chandler Tell it again. Seriously.
rachel I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?
joey Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography.
monica Joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.
joey Well, I think we all learned something.
phoebe Hey, you guys! Look what I found! Look at this! That's my Mom's writing! Look.
chandler Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965.
phoebe Y'know what that means?
joey That you're actually 50?
phoebe No-no, that's not, that's not me Phoebe, that's her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F. Best Friends Forever.
all Oh!
rachel That is so cool.
phoebe I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach?
all Yeah! Yeah, we can!
bonnie Shoot! I can't go, I have to work!
ross That's too bad.
rachel Ohh, big, fat bummerrr.
phoebe So great! Okay! Tomorrow we're gonna drive out to Montauk.
joey Hey, Bonnie had sex there!
monica Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.
chandler You're not gonna die an old maid, maybe an old spinster cook.
monica Thanks!
chandler Hey now besides, if worst comes to worst, I'll be your boyfriend.
monica Yeah right.
chandler Why is that so funny?
monica You made a joke right? So I laughed.
chandler Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material?
monica Well, no. You're Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!
chandler Okay, so we've established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren't friends, say it's a blind date. I show up at your door, and I'm like “Hey, nice to meet, ya. Hey, oh-hey.”
monica Well I'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.
joey Hey!
monica Oh, hey! Oh good, you brought food!
joey No, it's just my luggage.
joey Woo-hoo! All right! Yeah!
phoebe Oh, I am having the best karma this week. First, I find this woman who knew my parents, and then my client with the fuzzy back gives me his beach house.
ross Yeah? What about ah, that bike messenger you hit?
phoebe Oh, I wasn't talking about his karma.
rachel Hey!
chandler Hey!

rachel Aww Pheebs, that sucks!
phoebe Yeah, well, don't “Aww Pheebs, that sucks!” me yet.
chandler Where ya going?
phoebe Well, she's out of town so, there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my Father is.
ross Uh, Pheebs, some people call that breaking and entering.
phoebe Well, are any of those people here?!
all Oh, no!! No, no!
phoebe Okay, look I-I-I do something nice, okay? I'll-I'll fill her ice trays.

rachel I don't know.
ross You don't know?! Rach, you balded my girlfriend!
rachel All right! Ross, do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?
ross Y'know, hey! You're the one who ended it, remember?
rachel Yeah, because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you!

phoebe_sr What are you doing here?!
phoebe I-I, came to fill your ice cube trays.
phoebe_sr What?!
phoebe Umm, okay, okay, look. I took this picture from your fridge. Okay, because I know that this is my Father. Yeah, this is Frank Buffay and you are standing right there next to him. Now, look I deserve to know where I came from. All right? So if you can help me find my Father then you should! Otherwise, you're just mean! So, just tell me the truth!
phoebe_sr All right, the man in the picture is Chuck Magioni.
phoebe My Father is Chuck Magioni?
phoebe_sr No, no, that's just Chuck Magioni, I-I sold him a house last year! And I'm very sorry, but I don't know where your Father is, and that's the truth.
phoebe Oh.
phoebe_sr But umm, you're right. I think that a person should know where they come from. Wh-which is why I ah, ahh, okay. I'm your mother.
phoebe Heh?
phoebe_sr Y'know I wanted to tell you yesterday, but I just, I kinda felt all floopy, and...
joey I'm telling ya, you guys are totally getting back together!
ross That's not true! Her, she doesn't even know what she wants! Rachel's still mad about the whole thing.
chandler Okay, then you gotta back away, all right? You don't need that kind've hurt. Take it from a guy who's never had a long term relationship......
ross I know, but ahhhhhh!! I really wanna go up there and finish that kiss!
bonnie Hey!
chandler Ahhhh!
bonnie You guys, the water's great. You should really go in.
chandler Oh, ahh, no thanks, I just had an M&M.
bonnie Okay, well g'night.
ross Good night.
bonnie Don't be too long.
ross Okey-dokey!
chandler There is not one hair on that head.
ross Hey, it'll grow back, right? And she-she's really fun, and she's cool, and-and I'm finally moving on. Y'know? I mean getting over Rachel was so , y'know? Y'know, and I'm finally feeling sane again. And now if I go up there, and-and I kiss her, and, Gooood I wanna kiss her, and-and-and it doesn't work out, right? Do I really wanna put myself through that again?
joey So let me get this straight. If you go with Bonnie tonight, you're doing the smart, healthy thing and moving on.
ross Yeah.
joey Right, and you go with Rachel, Bonnie's free tonight?
ross Hi.
chandler Hi there.
monica That's that weird voice again.
chandler Okay! Okay! Let me try it again, you're gonna wanna date this next guy, I swear!
chandler Hi! I'm Dorf! You're date for the evening. Oh come on! Dorf on dating, that's good stuff!!
