chandler_bing We actually missed it.
phoebe_buffay Well, maybe you wouldn't have had you run in the chapel!
monica_geller This is insane!
phoebe_buffay What's the big deal, y'know? It's not like it's a real marriage.
chandler_bing What?!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, you're only married in Vegas.
monica_geller What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas you're married everywhere.
phoebe_buffay Really?!
monica_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Oh my God!-Eh! Well
rachel_green Ohhh!

dr_ross_geller No! But we-we didn't have...sex-uh, did we? I mean, I don't remember much about last night, it was such a blur.
rachel_green Oh! I remember laughing! I laughed a lot.
dr_ross_geller And we didn't have sex.
rachel_green Ohh, I mean, we were really drunk. I'm just glad we didn't do anything stupid.
dr_ross_geller Tell me about it.
joey_tribbiani Mornin' Pheebs. Well, my movie has officially been canceled.
phoebe_buffay Oh Joey, I'm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?
joey_tribbiani Nah, I'm too depressed to eat. I'll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess I'll just fly home with you guys, what time's your flight?
phoebe_buffay What about my cab?
joey_tribbiani I don't need that anymore.
phoebe_buffay No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.
joey_tribbiani I don't want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. Oh-ooh! How about you come with me?
phoebe_buffay I don't know, it's such a long trip.
joey_tribbiani It'll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.
phoebe_buffay Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?
joey_tribbiani Sure?
phoebe_buffay All right. Although I don't think we need one, I never stopped loving you.
chandler_bing Hi!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Hey.
chandler_bing So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?
phoebe_buffay Um-hmm, yeah. They left me a message; they should be here any minute.
joey_tribbiani Where is the waitress?! I'm starving!
chandler_bing It's a buffet man.
joey_tribbiani Oh, here's where I win all my money back!
chandler_bing Listen, I gotta talk to you.
joey_tribbiani Sure! What's up?
chandler_bing Monica and I almost got married last night.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! That's huge! Wait a minute, why come I wasn't invited? And who was going to be your best man? Don't say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."
chandler_bing Look, I just don't think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Y'know? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Y'know? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?
joey_tribbiani Oh! Tell her she's not marriage material.
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.
monica_geller How do I tell Chandler that it's too soon. It's gonna break his heart, he's not gonna think that I don't love him anymore.
phoebe_buffay Well you don't.
monica_geller Yes I do!
phoebe_buffay Good! Good! I was just testing you.
chandler_bing Hi.
monica_geller Oh hi! Hi! Y'know, we were just talking about bacon.
phoebe_buffay No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
the_girls#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller What?
chandler_bing Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Or
rachel_green I don't know. What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.
monica_geller Rach! We weren't gonna miss our friends getting married!
rachel_green Who got married?!
chandler_bing You did.
dr_ross_geller What?! Hello! We didn't get married.
rachel_green No, we didn't get married! That's ridiculous!
dr_ross_geller We-we-we-I remember being in a chapel.
rachel_green Oh my God.
dr_ross_geller I-They would not let us get married when we were that drunk!
rachel_green No!
joey_tribbiani They let you get married when you're drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!
phoebe_buffay Hell, I'm drunk right now! What? I can't have a mimosa with breakfast?! I'm on vacation!
monica_geller What are you guys gonna do?
rachel_green Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer?
chandler_bing Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this one's free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third one's free.
dr_ross_geller Laugh it up, but the joke's on you. Because we don't need to get divorced, okay? We we're just gonna get an annulment.
joey_tribbiani An annulment? Ross! I don't think surgery's the answer here.
phoebe_buffay Oh-oh, that's your thing.
dr_ross_geller What?
phoebe_buffay You're thing. You're thing. Y'know? You're the guy who gets divorced.
all@ Oh yeah!
dr_ross_geller No-no, that's-that's not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!
phoebe_buffay Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much you're probably gonna marry it! Then it won't work out and you're gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. I'm so drunk.
monica_geller So, what do you think we should do?
chandler_bing I don't know. But I-I-I know I love you!
monica_geller I know I love you!
chandler_bing So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.
monica_geller That's a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!
chandler_bing Yes, we don't get married unless there's a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight then there's a definite sign that we should get married.
monica_geller All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we don't get married.
chandler_bing Sounds great.
monica_geller Okay.
the_croupier Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.
monica_geller Ready?
chandler_bing Ready!
monica_geller Come on eight.
chandler_bing Yes, yes eight.
the_croupier Eight! Easy eight.
monica_geller Wow! I can't believe I actually rolled an eight.
chandler_bing That was so unlikely. Well, let's get married! I guess.
monica_geller Wait a minute. That wasn't a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.
chandler_bing That's right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!
monica_geller I wanted it so bad! Wanna go pack?
chandler_bing Yeah. We're doing the right thing, right?
monica_geller Ohh, of course we are! We left it up to fate. If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign.
phoebe_buffay Okay, you have 19 questions left. Use them wisely. Come on Joey! You can't win if you don't ask any QUESTIONS!!!
joey_tribbiani What?!
phoebe_buffay Well, you promised me a fun road trip! We've been on the road six hours and you've been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!
joey_tribbiani All right. All right.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radio's broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.
joey_tribbiani Really? I don't
phoebe_buffay Sing!!
joey_tribbiani I wanna rock and roll all night!
joey_tribbiani Man, this is a long drive! Are my eyes open? No!
hitchhiker#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 Morning!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey, hubby!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Yeah, actually um, I wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing?
rachel_green Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller I'm not going to do that.
rachel_green Okay! So, we'll just stay married.
dr_ross_geller Yes, exactly!
rachel_green And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!
dr_ross_geller Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought I'd have to talk you into this more.
rachel_green Okay, see now I'm scared because I don't actually think you're kidding.
dr_ross_geller I'm-I'm not kidding. Look I-I, I can't have three failed marriages. I can't. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!
rachel_green What-wh-what so we'll just stay married forever?!
dr_ross_geller Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! It's right next to it!
rachel_green Ohh, okay, I'm sorry. You're right. Y'know what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what you're asking of me.
dr_ross_geller I'm asking you to do me a favor.
rachel_green You are asking me to be your wife!
dr_ross_geller And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.
monica_geller That kid really kicked me hard on the plane.
chandler_bing Well you did pull his hair.
monica_geller He took my snack!
chandler_bing I'm not getting into this again!
monica_geller Okay! Oh God, y'know what? It's really bad.
chandler_bing Well, I told you not to walk. Here. There. Okay.
monica_geller This doesn't mean anything, does it?
chandler_bing No!
monica_geller Okay.
phoebe_buffay How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rape-, a rapist or a killer or something!
joey_tribbiani Don't you think I asked him that before he got in?!
phoebe_buffay Y'know what? I'm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! And you, are you a rapist?!
hitchhiker#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 No!
phoebe_buffay Do you like car games?
hitchhiker#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 Yeah, y'know the license plate game?

joey_tribbiani Ooh, I'll play! I'll play!
phoebe_buffay No-No! You need your sleep. Night-night! Shh!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
dr_ross_geller Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. We register, and you get to keep all the presents!
rachel_green No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.
dr_ross_geller I don't know if it's true.
rachel_green Oh b-b-but it is!
dr_ross_geller Oh, okay, y'know what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...
rachel_green Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the world's worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!
dr_ross_geller All right. All right, I'll do it.
rachel_green Thank you. Hey-hey umm, uh, is there, is there any such thing as an annulment shower?
hitchhiker#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 Wait! Wait! There is the train station!
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay.
hitchhiker#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.
phoebe_buffay And I have your name and the fact that you're a drifter, so the ball's pretty much in your court.
hitchhiker#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode01 All right, see ya Pheebs.
joey_tribbiani Come on Pheebs! I can't take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!
phoebe_buffay Stop it! Stop it no! That's not fair! Y'know I can't resist that beautiful voice!
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didn't deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.
phoebe_buffay You can still sleep at night and stuff.
joey_tribbiani Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? I've got a really good one! I've been thinking about it since Kansas.

monica_geller I'm sick of the signs! It's too fast, I'm happy the way things are!
chandler_bing Me too!
monica_geller I don't want things to change! Do you?
chandler_bing No!

chandler_bing Jeez, relax! It's not like we're mar-ah-ah!!
chandler_bing Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
monica_geller Then all your stuff would be here.
chandler_bing Well, what if all my stuff was here?
monica_geller Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
chandler_bing Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
monica_geller Live together? There have been no signs for that.
chandler_bing Me asking is kind of a sign.
