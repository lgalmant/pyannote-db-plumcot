monica It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.
ross Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!
chandler I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?
ross Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.
rachel I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!
ross Why do you care so much?
monica Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?
rachel Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.
ross Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...
phoebe Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!
rachel All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...
ross Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...
ross Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!
joey Hey!
all Hi!
ross I'm gonna get some more coffee.
charlie Oh, you know what? I'll come with you!
ross Ok.
chandler So, a professor, uh?
joey Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?
charlie I feel like I owe you an explanation. I don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties. I'm... well, I'm kind of embarrassed. I really hope you don't think less of me.
ross Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.
charlie You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean, Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors, and intellectuals, and paleontologists mostly, you know, very cerebral...
ross Yeah, I know the type.
joey Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close?
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey!
phoebe Hey you guys! Look what I just got.
rachel Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?
phoebe I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.
rachel Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!
phoebe Oh... then I overpaid.
monica Hey, what's this?
rachel Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.
monica Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.
rachel Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...
monica Do you wanna go hunting?
rachel Well, I would like to have the option!!
phoebe What's up? Hey, Rachel!!
rachel Oh!
phoebe No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these "big massage places"! They're putting people like me out of business!
monica And she wants to go hunting, too!!
rachel Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!
phoebe Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.
rachel I don't care about any of that!!
phoebe Well, do you care about friendship?
rachel Oh!
phoebe I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.
rachel Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!
phoebe Promise?
rachel I promise.
phoebe Thank you.
rachel But I am going hunting!!
monica Hey honey! I missed you today!
chandler Oh, yeah?
monica Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?
chandler Oh, well... Maybe we could...
monica Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.
chandler We really need to take those tests?
monica Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
chandler But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
monica What is the big deal?
chandler It's weird! In a doctor's office?
monica It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?
chandler I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!
monica Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!
chandler Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!
monica OH!
chandler Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!
joey Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!
joey Heeey!
charlie Hi!
joey Come on in, how are ya?
charlie I'm good!
joey Can I offer you a drink?
charlie Please, I've been crazed all day! I had a meeting with the Dean, and my syllabus for summer school is due and I'm writing the Foreword for a friend's book...
joey Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!
charlie So I am just so excited to be here. And I can't wait to start exploring the city!
joey Hey, if you need a tour guide...
charlie Oh, you mean it? That would be so fun!
joey Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?
charlie Oh, well, we can go see the Chronos Quartet at the Avery Fisher Hall.
joey Ok!
charlie And there is a collection of Walt Whitman letters on display at the public library.
joey I know, yeah!
charlie And first, I have to see the MET!
joey Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.
charlie No, no, no, not the Mets, the MET, singular!
joey Which one, they all suck!
charlie The museum!
joey I don't think so.
rachel Hi there!
receptionist Hello, welcome to Lavender Day Spa SPA. How may I help you?
rachel Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.
receptionist This has been torn up.
rachel And... taped back together.
receptionist Ok well, I'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.
rachel Ok
receptionist Have a seat through the glass doors.
rachel through the glass doors.
receptionist Through the glass doors.
rachel Alright-y then.
receptionist Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.
phoebe Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?
receptionist Sorry, everyone is booked!
phoebe But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.
receptionist Then why you work here?
phoebe 'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!
receptionist Well, I think this is a great place to work!
phoebe Ok, are they listening?
joey Ross!
ross Hi!
joey I need to talk to you about Charlie.
ross Oh, do you, do you really?
joey Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.
ross Look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it!
joey No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...
ross Get to the problem!
joey Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!
ross Are you wearing two belts?
joey EH, what do you know!
ross You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.
joey Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!
ross You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.
joey Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.
ross Fine.
joey Thanks.
ross Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!
joey The Metsss!
ross Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
joey Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!
ross Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!
joey Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.
ross Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.
joey Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!
ross But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...
joey Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?
ross Ok.
joey You got to tell me exactly what to do there.
ross Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.
joey Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right
chandler I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.
monica Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.
nurse Mr. Bing? Here you are! You'll go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.
chandler Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.
monica Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?
chandler Yeah, I guess!
monica I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!
janice OH MY GOD!!
chandler Oh, Come on!
janice Ah ahahahhahaa! How great is this!
monica Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!
chandler Why are you here?
janice Well, Sid and I are trying again and we had trouble last time because apparently we...
chandler No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??
janice Oh! Someone's a little cranky today cuz they have to do it in a cup! Oh! They gave you the kiddy size .
chandler What!?
monica This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!
chandler I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...
janice Please... go! Just let me know if you need a hand!
chandler I think it just fell off.
phoebe Hello "ja", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.
rachel Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.
phoebe Okay, then I'm Swedish...
monica So, what's your name?
phoebe It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...
rachel Oh... what an interesting name.
phoebe Ja!
rachel You know I...
phoebe Time for your scalp massage!
rachel Wow... I really love your...
phoebe Is something wrong?
rachel No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?
phoebe Uhm... Stockholm.
rachel Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!
joey Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.
ross Now, do you have any idea what you just said?
joey (shaking his head as if to say
ross Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.
joey Phonetically?
ross Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.
joey Ok.
ross Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!
joey Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on "Days" I had to say "Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy".
ross Wow. What does that mean?
joey No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means "you're gonna get eaten by a bear".
ross Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?
joey Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .
ross Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.
joey Come on! you...
ross No!
chandler My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?
janice Oh! Sid is still in his room. I don't allow porn at home so this is like a vacation for him. So did you do it? Did you make your deposit?
chandler Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!
janice That's not the hard part honey! The hard part is what comes next, I mean aren't you worried about the results?
chandler I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.
janice Oh! Well, you know what? It probably is.
chandler Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?
janice Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children. I am sure it's gonna be just fine.
chandler oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...
janice What, you can do it in the parking lot of a Taco Bell, but you can't do it at a doctor's office?
chandler It was a "Wendy's!! "
phoebe "Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! " And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!
rachel Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.
phoebe Oh, Ja! Ja!
rachel Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...
phoebe Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?
rachel I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...
phoebe Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!
rachel Phoebe!!
phoebe You know it's me?
rachel For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!
phoebe How can you come here?
rachel How could you not tell me you worked here?
phoebe I don't have to tell you everything!
rachel Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!
phoebe Tips not included.
rachel Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?
phoebe Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!
rachel Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!
phoebe You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!
rachel Good for you Pheebs!
phoebe Ok.
phoebe Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.
ross Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!
ross Respectfully, professor R. Geller. Hey!
charlie Hi!
ross Hey, how was the Met?
charlie The museum was amazing!
ross Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?
charlie Not so much, no. He had clearly memorized all the stuff to say, and some of it didn't even make any sense.
ross What do you mean?
charlie Well, for one, he was talking about paintings that were nowhere around.
ross Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?
charlie No, we went to the left.
ross Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.
charlie Yeah, it's fun .
ross What?
charlie Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really know me that well; it would be weird.
ross What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.
charlie Well... I'm just thinking that maybe he's not the right guy to be with right now, maybe I should be with someone... I have more in common with. You know what I mean?
ross Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.
charlie Yeah, I guess that's true.
ross And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.
charlie He is very sweet. Plus he's hot!
ross That was going to be my next argument.
joey Hey!
ross Hey!
charlie Hey!
joey You're ready?
charlie Yeah, let's go. Thanks Ross.
joey Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.
ross Glad I could help man.
joey Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work.
chandler It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.
chandler Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.
monica Hey sweetie.
chandler Doctor Connelly just called.
monica With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said "Doctor Connelly just called". If it was good news you would have said "Doctor Connelly just called! " But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?
chandler Actually it's both of us.
monica What?
chandler Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.
monica Oh... what does that mean?
chandler It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...
monica Chandler?
chandler It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.
monica Oh my God!
chandler I'm sorry.
monica I'm sorry too.
chandler Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.
monica I know.
receptionist Good morning Phoebe.
phoebe Good morning receptionist.
receptionist Here's your schedule for the day. Your first client is in room No. 1.
phoebe Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?
phoebe Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.
