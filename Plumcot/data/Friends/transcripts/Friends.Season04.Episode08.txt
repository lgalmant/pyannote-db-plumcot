joey_tribbiani Hello.

joey_tribbiani Stop callin'!!
voice#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode08 Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily challenge.
joey_tribbiani All right!
voice#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode08 What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything
chandler_bing Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!
phoebe_buffay Look everyone, it's the spirit of Thanksgiving!
rachel_green So are things with you and Joey any better?
chandler_bing They couldn't be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.
rachel_green Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?
dr_ross_geller Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?
rachel_green You shouldn't.
phoebe_buffay Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and there's the added mystery of who gets who.
dr_ross_geller Who gets whom. I don't know why I do that.
rachel_green Well, I'm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.
monica_geller We haven't eaten yet!
rachel_green I know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, I just
chandler_bing Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, 'cause I wanna trade for her.
phoebe_buffay I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!
chandler_bing Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?
phoebe_buffay Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it's like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let's trade!
chandler_bing Oh that's not true! That's not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it... Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on it... Her initials
phoebe_buffay Ohh.
monica_geller Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.
chandler_bing Op, y'know what though, it's kind've a girlie briefcase.
monica_geller Who cares? He works in a museum!
chandler_bing Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!
phoebe_buffay You don't have to do that, Ross and Joey aren't here, you can watch the parade if you want.
chandler_bing Thanks.
monica_geller What is wrong with this freezer?! Ow! Ow!!
phoebe_buffay God, what happened?!
monica_geller Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!
rachel_green People are trying to sleep in here!
chandler_bing Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.
phoebe_buffay Open it up, let me see.
monica_geller Oh, y'know what, I can't, it really kills.
chandler_bing Well maybe you should put some ice on it.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, God it looks bad.
rachel_green Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.
monica_geller No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can't go to him when I don't have a boyfriend!
chandler_bing He's really picky about his patients.
phoebe_buffay Honey, you've got to go. What's his office number?
monica_geller Like I remember his office number! Speed dial 7.
phoebe_buffay Hi! Yeah, I'm calling on behalf of Monica Geller's eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. He's out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?
monica_geller Yes!!
phoebe_buffay Yes! She's very excited about that.
phoebe_buffay This is so cool, 'til Monica gets back, it's like I'm head chef and I get to make all the decisions.
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!
phoebe_buffay Okay, get out of my kitchen!
chandler_bing All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.
phoebe_buffay All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.
dr_ross_geller So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I'm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.
chandler_bing Oh y'know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.
dr_ross_geller Really?! Wow! That's-that's so nice, what are you gonna get me?
chandler_bing I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no, you don't want to do that, then you're gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's not true! I've got her lots of stuff she never took back.
chandler_bing Like?
dr_ross_geller Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.
chandler_bing When was the last time you saw her wear it?
dr_ross_geller Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh
chandler_bing Big dog?
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani I'm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.
dr_ross_geller Everything? Even the TV?
joey_tribbiani No! I'm putting that in my room.
dr_ross_geller Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don't you think you could at least hear the guy out?
joey_tribbiani Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?
dr_ross_geller That's a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?
joey_tribbiani Five years.
dr_ross_geller You've sentenced him?!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
dr_ross_geller Joey, the guy's your best friend.
joey_tribbiani No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don't know why you're pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.
dr_ross_geller Oh, who? Me?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Wow! I'm honored! And y'know what I'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?
joey_tribbiani What?
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.
joey_tribbiani All right. But if you weren't my best friend.
kathy Oh my God, is it really that bad?
chandler_bing I walk into a room and he won't even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.
joey_tribbiani Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?
gunther I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.
kathy Oh.
chandler_bing Hey Joe.
doctor#unknown#Friends.Season04.Episode08 I'll be right with you. Okay? Thanks, Wendy.
monica_geller Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?
rachel_green Ooh, so cute, that I'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.
nurse Dr. Burke will see you know.
monica_geller Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.
nurse Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.
dr_tim_burke Ready?
chandler_bing Hey! I'm sorry! That - where are you going?
joey_tribbiani My folks.
chandler_bing Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I
chandler_bing Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?
joey_tribbiani Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.
chandler_bing Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.
chandler_bing All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!
joey_tribbiani When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!
chandler_bing All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?
joey_tribbiani We've got a box.
dr_tim_burke Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.
monica_geller I was probably waiting for it to open.
dr_tim_burke I gotta tell you, you look great now.
monica_geller You look great too.
dr_tim_burke You're an excellent patient!
monica_geller So how does it look?
dr_tim_burke Well, you've got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.
monica_geller Like a pirate?!
dr_tim_burke If that helps you.
monica_geller Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? Come on, one of us had to mention him.
dr_tim_burke I moved back here a couple of months ago.
monica_geller Oh. Big family dinner tonight?
dr_tim_burke Uh.
monica_geller No way!
dr_tim_burke I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.
monica_geller Oh.
dr_tim_burke But we broke up.
monica_geller Oh.
dr_tim_burke She-she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.
monica_geller Oh. So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?
dr_tim_burke You're not wearing the patch yet.
monica_geller I know.
dr_ross_geller He's coming here for Thanksgiving!
rachel_green I know, it's sick.
monica_geller Why is it sick?
rachel_green Because it's Richard's son! It's like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!
monica_geller Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don't you?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I can see where I'd be your best shot but, no. I'm sorry, but I think it's twisted.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
joey_tribbiani What's twisted?
monica_geller Me going out with Richard's son.
joey_tribbiani Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!
chandler_bing Sounds like a really bad idea to me.
rachel_green Is he okay in there?
joey_tribbiani He's fine!
dr_ross_geller Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard's son, you'd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.
monica_geller Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!
rachel_green So now, what exactly is the point of the box?
joey_tribbiani Chandler?
chandler_bing The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!
dr_ross_geller Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?
rachel_green Why?
dr_ross_geller I just wanna check something.
rachel_green Okay.
dr_ross_geller Now, we'll see.
chandler_bing Air hole! Air hole!!
rachel_green Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.
dr_ross_geller The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.
rachel_green Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!
rachel_green Well isn't it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?
dr_ross_geller What did you get?
rachel_green Credit.
monica_geller I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! I'll get it! Hi, Tim.
dr_tim_burke Hi.
monica_geller Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.
dr_tim_burke Hi, nice to meet you.
monica_geller And Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_tim_burke Hi, Joey.
monica_geller My brother, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
monica_geller And Rachel. And that's Chandler.
chandler_bing How do ya do.
dr_tim_burke What's
monica_geller Umm, well, he's
joey_tribbiani He's doin' some thinkin'!
chandler_bing What happened? What happened?!
joey_tribbiani You kissed my girlfriend!
rachel_green Ooh, I like those sunglasses.
dr_ross_geller Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?
monica_geller All right everybody, this turkey is ready!
dr_tim_burke Where can I wash up?
monica_geller Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.
dr_tim_burke Thank you.
rachel_green Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!
monica_geller See he's nice. Right?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "That's not how your dad used to do it."
dr_tim_burke Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?
monica_geller I saved you a seat.
rachel_green Sick-sick-sick-sick.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'll get it.
chandler_bing Gotcha!
joey_tribbiani That doesn't sound like thinking to me!
chandler_bing Sorry!
joey_tribbiani Y'know I don't think you should be talking at all in there! I think you've got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!
chandler_bing Okay, okay, you got it!
rachel_green Ross, can you pass me the yams?
dr_ross_geller Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.
rachel_green Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!
monica_geller Oh-ho-ho, we've got company.
dr_ross_geller There's nothing the matter with me. See, I'm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.
rachel_green Okay, fine.
chandler_bing You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!
joey_tribbiani All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!
chandler_bing You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.
joey_tribbiani So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?
chandler_bing Absolutely!
joey_tribbiani That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.
rachel_green Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!
dr_ross_geller I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.
monica_geller Ooh, this always happens.
dr_tim_burke Here, let me help.
monica_geller Thank you.
dr_tim_burke You-you have a very beautiful... eye.
monica_geller Y'know all my friends think this is weird.
dr_tim_burke Y'know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isn't.
monica_geller I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.
dr_tim_burke Oh, I totally agree.
monica_geller We're just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?
dr_tim_burke What?
monica_geller Nothing. Nothing.
dr_tim_burke No-no really, was-was that not okay?
monica_geller No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss
dr_tim_burke Oh my God! It didn't remind you of
monica_geller Don't say it!
dr_tim_burke No, but it did! Didn't it?!
monica_geller Yeah!
dr_tim_burke Oh man!!
monica_geller I know!
joey_tribbiani I'll get it.
kathy Oh.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
kathy Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am
joey_tribbiani That's okay. Chandler's the one I'm mad at.
kathy Well, I'm still sorry. Is he here?
joey_tribbiani In the box.
kathy Chandler?
phoebe_buffay Oh, he-he can't talk right now.
kathy Why not? What's going on?
phoebe_buffay He's just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.
kathy By being in a box?
rachel_green Joey, had reasons.
phoebe_buffay They were threefold.
kathy Oh. Well uh, you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen umm... Listen I don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I don't wanna be the cause of that. So, I don't think we can see each other anymore. I'm gonna go to my mom's in Chicago, I'm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this could've be something really amazing, but y'know this is probably for the best. Y'know? I'm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.
joey_tribbiani Open the box!!
rachel_green What?!
joey_tribbiani He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! Get out of there!
chandler_bing So?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we're gonna be fine! Get out!
chandler_bing Yeah?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you did some real good thinkin' in there.
chandler_bing Man, this is
joey_tribbiani Now go! 'Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from you're secret Santa!
joey_tribbiani All right, who got Chandler? 'Cause I uh, need to trade.
rachel_green Oh, he sees her!
monica_geller Oh, he's catching up to her!
phoebe_buffay Oh, she sees him! Oh, they're hugging!
dr_ross_geller He's taking her purse!
joey_tribbiani Uhh, that's not them. I'm gonna go call the police.
phoebe_buffay Oh, there they are!
phoebe_buffay All right, get a room.
