rachel Oh!
chandler So, where's Mike?
phoebe Oh, he's at the doctor, he didn't poop the whole time we were there!
joey Well anyway, I'm glad you're back, I really need your help.
phoebe Oh, why? What's up?
joey I have an audition for this play and for some of it I have to speak French. Which, according to my rÃ©sumÃ©, I'm fluent in.
ross Joey, you shouldn't lie on your rÃ©sumÃ©.
monica Yeah, you really shouldn't. By the way, how was that year-long dig in Cairo?
ross It was ok...
rachel I did not know you spoke French.
phoebe Oui, bien sur je parle FranÃ§ais! Qu'est-ce que tu penses alors?
rachel Oh... you're so sexy!
joey Well, so, will you help me? I really wanna be in this play.
phoebe Sure! Tout le plaisir est pour moi, mon ami.
rachel Seriously stop it, or I'm gonna jump on ya.
chandler Hey.
monica Hey.
chandler Why are you wearing my apron?
monica I'm making cookies for Erica. And oh, by the way, we have to leave for the airport soon, her plane comes in about an hour.
chandler Oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if I introduce you two as "my wife" and "the woman who's carrying my child"? No? Divorce?
ross Hey.
monica Hey.
ross You guys know where Rachel is?
monica No, we haven't seen her since this morning.
ross So unbelievable. She was supposed to meet me half an hour ago with Emma.
monica Hey!
ross Hey!
monica These are for Erica!
ross What? She's gonna eat all those cookies?
monica Well, I want he baby to come out all cute and fat!
ross So, why is Erica coming to visit?
monica Well, because we want to get to know her better and she's never been to New York so she wants to see all the tourists' spots... you know, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building...
chandler Oh, those places! There's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes "Mooooo"!
monica Well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?
ross Oh, hi! Hi! Thanks for showing you up thirty minutes late!
rachel Ross...
ross No, no, no, I'm sure you have a great excuse, wh-was it a hair appointment, a mani-pedi or was there a sale at Barney's?
rachel My father had an heart attack... ...while I was at Barneyâ€™s.
ross Oh my God.
monica Honey.
chandler I'm so sorry...
ross Is-is he ok?
rachel Yeah, they said he's gonna be fine, but he's still heavily sedated.
ross Ok, ok. I'm gonna come out to Long Island with you, I mean, you can't be alone right now.
rachel No, come on, I'm totally ok. I don't need you to come! I can totally handle this on my own.
ross Still-still, let me come... for me.
rachel Ok. If you really need to.
ross I bet someone could use one of Monica's freshly baked cookies.
rachel Oh, I really could.
ross Oh!
rachel Ohh...
phoebe All right, it seems pretty simple. Your first line is "My name is Claude", so, just repeat after me. "Je m'appelle Claude".

joey Ok.
phoebe Je m'appelle Claude.

chandler Monica. Calm, self.
erica Thank you. It's really nice to meet you guys, I can't believe I'm here!
joey Welcome to New York City! Or should I say "ghe deu flooff New York City"?
chandler Why would you say that?
phoebe Ok. What are you gonna be doing today?
erica I wanna see everything! Times Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center...
joey Oh, you know what you should do? You should walk all the way at the top of Statue of Liberty.
erica Oh yeah, let's do that!
chandler Great! This baby'd better to be really good.
rachel Oh, uhm, excuse me, I'm here to see my father. My name is Rachel Green.
ross And I'm Doctor Ross Geller.
rachel Ross, please, this is a hospital, ok? That actually means something here.
rachel Can somebody please go in?
nurse Absolutely.
ross Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here, because my throat is feeling a little scratchy, I don't want to infect him.
rachel Ross, please, don't be so scared of him!
ross I'm not scared of him, I'm really sick!
nurse He's under sedation, so he's pretty much out.
ross I'm feeling better.
rachel Oh! Oh! Oh my God! Ohhh, ohhh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got him was just money down the drain, huh?
nurse Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.
rachel Oh, great, Are you gonna be ok?
ross He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine!
rachel_ Ok.
ross Did the TV wake you?
dr_green No, when you put your feet up in my bed, you tugged on my catheter.
ross Ouchy.
dr_green What are you doing here, Geller?
ross Well, I came with Rachel, who should be back any second! So what's new?
dr_green Ooh, I have a little heart attack.
ross Right, is it painful?
dr_green What, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?
dr_green So what's new with you, uh, knocked up any more of my daughters lately?
ross Nope, just the one. RACH!
phoebe Je m'appelle Claude.
joey Je do call blue!
phoebe Noooo! Ok, maybe if we just break it down. Ok, let's try at one syllable at a time. Ok? So repeat after me. "je".
joey je.
phoebe m'ap
joey mah
phoebe pelle
joey pel.
phoebe Great, ok faster! "je"
joey je.
phoebe m'ap

joey Don't move! Don't go! I need you! My audition is tomorrow! Shah blue blah! Me lah peeh! Ombrah! . Pooh.
ross Hey!
rachel Hi!
ross I was gonna make us some dinner but all I found in your dad's fridge was bacon and heavy cream. I think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.
rachel Uh. Did you call your parents?
ross Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.
rachel Oh good.
ross Wow.
rachel What?
ross Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
rachel What do you mean? You've been in my room before!
ross Yeah, sure, right! Like I've ever been in Rachel Green's room.
rachel Ok I gotta tell ya, it's really weird when you use my whole name.
ross Sorry. . You ok?
rachel Yeah.
ross You had a rough day, uh?
rachel Yeah, just so weird seeing him like that, you know? I mean he is a doctor, you don't expect doctors to get sick!
ross But we do! It's gonna be ok, Rach!
rachel Ow. I don't want him to wake up alone! I should go to the hospital!
ross What? No, no! Hey, hey, hey look...
rachel What?
ross They gave him a lot of medication, ok? He wouldn't even know if you were there. Look, we'll go see him first thing in the morning, ok?
rachel Really, I shouldn't feel guilty?
ross No, God! Hey, Rach, you've been an amazing daughter, ok? Right now you just need to get some rest.
rachel Ok, maybe you're right.
ross Good night.
rachel Wait, wait, wait, wait. Would you stay here with me for a little while?
ross Sure!
rachel Ok. Thank you for coming with me today.
ross Oh, of course...
rachel Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room!
ross Me too. Come here.
rachel I just don't want to be alone tonight.
ross Ok, well, uh, I can maybe grab a sleeping bag, or... Oh, oh. . No, Rach! I'm sorry, I just don't think this, this, this is a good idea.
rachel Wait, we won't know that until we do it, will we?
ross No, look, uh. You are upset about your father and you're feeling vulnerable and I just don't feel it would be right, I'd feel like I'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.
rachel Taking advantage? I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!
ross Look, I'm sure it would be great, but I-I think one of us has to be thinking clearly, so, I'm gonna go!
rachel Wow. Ok.
ross I'll see you in the morning .
rachel Mhm-mh!
ross Haven't had sex in four months, I should get a medal for that!
erica Thanks so much for taking me to all those places. I had a great time.
monica Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologize about Chandler, though. I just did not see this coming.
chandler New York is awesome!
monica What is with you?
chandler Yeah, I've been to these places before, but I've never really seen them, you know.
monica Yeah, you miss alot, when you're moo-ing.
erica Thanks so much for showing me around.
monica Oh! It was our pleasure. We are so much enjoying getting to know you.
erica Well, if there is anything else you wanna know...
chandler Oh, uhm, okay, uhm, do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father?
erica Oh, sure. Yeah, well, he was my high school boyfriend. Captain of the football team, really cute and he got a scholarship and went off to college.
chandler That's great.
erica Yeah... it's almost definitely him.
monica How's that now?
erica Well, there is a chance it's another guy. I mean, I have only ever been with two guys, but they sorta overlapped.
chandler So, what does the other guy do? Does he go to college too?
erica No, he's in prison.
monica Was he falsely accused of something?
erica No... he killed his father with a shovel. But other than that, he's a great guy.
chandler I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
monica Are you awake?
chandler Of course I'm awake. Assume from now on that I'm always awake!
monica Alright, we don't know that it's him. I mean, it could be the football guy.
chandler Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel-killer.
monica Alright, lets say that it is him, would we not want the baby? No! Would we treat him any differently?
chandler I'd keep an eye on him! We have to find out which one the father is.
monica How?
chandler I dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?
monica Yeah, but maybe we're just over-reacting.
chandler Pff, easy for you to say, he's a father killer. He probably loves him mommy. He's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm!
tape We will now count from one to five. Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq.
joey Huh, un, blu, bla, flu, flenk!
tape Good job.
joey Thank you.
phoebe Hey Joey.
joey Hey!
phoebe Listen, I feel really badly about yesterday and I thought about it a lot and, and I know, I was too impatient. SO lets try it again.
joey Oh, no, that's okay, I don't need your help. I worked on it myself and I gotta say, I am pretty good!
phoebe Really, can I hear some of it.
joey Sure, sure. Ok, "Bleu de la bleu, de la blu bla bleu" See?
phoebe Well, you're not, You're not... you're not... again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!
joey Oh well I think I am, yeah and I think I'm definitely gonna get the part.
phoebe How could you possibly think that?
joey For one thing, the guy on the tape said I was doing a good job!
ross Hey Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?
rachel Sure.
ross You've been quiet all morning. Is everything okay?
rachel Hmm-hmm.
ross You sure you're alright?
rachel Yep.
ross O-kay. Well, I'm gonna go grab us some breakfast.
rachel FYI..
ross There it is...
rachel In the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex... just do it.
ross Wait, wait, You're mad at me about last night? I was just trying to do the right thing.
rachel Really? Well, it seems to me if you'd done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed, I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied!
ross Well...
rachel Oh stop that!
ross I can't believe this. I was just being a good guy. I treated you with respect and understanding.
rachel Oh, that is so hot. She walks around him to the other side)
ross Hey, I was looking out for you.
rachel Oh, really, well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl. I don't need someone telling me what is best for me.
ross I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever.
rachel Oh, really, really? Well, it wasn't very good for me either.
ross Hey you know what? You know what? To avoid this little thing in the future, let's just say, you and me, never having sex again.
rachel What?
ross That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?
chandler Hey! How was lunch?
erica We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob
chandler Oh, really?
erica No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing.
chandler O-okay. So, is she gonna take the test?
monica Nope, she doesn't have to, I found out who the father is.
chandler Oh God. It's shovely-Joe, isn't it?
monica No it's not.
chandler How do you know?
erica Well, it turns out that Erica didn't pay much attention in Sex Ed class, because the thing she did with that prison guy... it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
chandler Oh God! What was it? The thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?
monica The thing we never do.
chandler Shovely Joe!
director Whenever you're ready Joey.
joey Right. Dja bu bu Claude. Uh, c'est la pu les la lu blah bloo.
casting_assistant I'm sorry, what's going on?
joey Dude, come on! French it u-up!
director Joey, do you speak French?
joey Toutes la smore! Bu blu-ay bloo blah ooh! Pfoof!
director You know what. I think this audition is over.
phoebe Uh, excuse me. Uh, I am ReginÃ© Philange. I was passing by when I heard this man speaking the regional dialect of my French town of EstÃ©e Lauder.
director You really think this man is speaking French?
joey Sa-sa-saw!
phoebe Ã‰coutez, je vais vous dire la vÃ©ritÃ©. C'est mon petit frÃ¨re. Il est un peu retardÃ©. (Translation
phoebe Alors, si vous pouviez jouer le jeu avec lui... (Translation
director Good job, little buddy. That was some really good French. But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
joey Ah. All right. But my French was good?
director It was great.
joey Oh-hoh! Ha-hah! See!
phoebe Merci. Au revoir. (Translation
joey Yeah-hah. Toute-de-le-fruit.
ross Emma's down for the night.
rachel Oh, good.
ross So uh... I guess I wanna take off.
rachel Okay... Hey listen, just before you go I-I again, I just wanna say "thank you" for coming with me.
ross Oh, no problem.
rachel And also, you know I uh, I was thinking about what you said, you know, about the whole sex thing and... it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
ross Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
rachel It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good.
ross Yeah... Yeah, that's true.
rachel Hey uhm, do you remember that one really great time...?
ross Oh, ye-ah!
rachel You know it was you're uhm... birthday...
ross ...Valentine's day...
both Oh yeah!
rachel Well, I guess that's all in the past, now.
ross Hmmm-mmmm.
rachel Not even one more time?
ross Not even once.
rachel No matter how much we want it.
ross Even if we want it really bad.
rachel That's what we decided.
ross Uhm, right!
rachel ...It's kinda hard though!
ross Yeah.
rachel You know, when two people have a connection, you know, that's... just seems like such a... waste.
ross ...I hate waste.
rachel ...Ross?
ross Yes?
rachel Just so you know... With us... it's never off the table.
ross Damn it. It's never off the table.
phoebe Okay, can you really tapdance?
joey No.
phoebe It's off the resumÃ©.
phoebe Archery?
joey No.
phoebe Horseback riding?
joey Would fall off a lot.
phoebe You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
joey That I can do.
phoebe Come on! You can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?
joey All right, watch me! Okay, you time me. Ready?
phoebe Ready... GO!
phoebe You did it!
