chandler_bing Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing We're just here to say goodbye, we're off to Ohio.
phoebe_buffay Oh, right! Your adoption interview!
monica_geller Yep, we're gonna meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe it. When you guys come back, you're gonna have a baby! That is so weird!
chandler_bing And so incorrect!
monica_geller She's only a couple of months pregnant. She liked our application but who knows if she's gonna like us.
dr_ross_geller Come on, she's gonna love you guys!
chandler_bing Uhm, thank you, but we're really trying not to get our hopes up.
monica_geller And a lot could still get in our way.
chandler_bing Yeah. I mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..
phoebe_buffay What are you gonna name the baby?
chandler_bing I can develop a condition in which I talk and talk and no one hears a word.
joey_tribbiani But just think, ok? What if everything goes right? What if this woman does pick you guys?
monica_geller Oh my God. She's gonna pick us!
chandler_bing So we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?
monica_geller You know, I know that things could still go wrong but if they don't? If this works out, we're gonna have a baby Chandler, a baby!
chandler_bing Yes, but...
monica_geller Oh my God, it's gonna WORK! We're gonna make it work! I'm gonna be a mummy and you're gonna be a daddy! All right, I'll see you suckers. I'm gonna get me... A BABY! {she leaves)
chandler_bing Oh, screw it, I'm gonna be a daddy!!
rachel_green Hey, who's Phoebe with?
joey_tribbiani I'm gonna say someone I'm gonna have sex with. Hey!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani So... who's your friend?
phoebe_buffay Oh, that's Sarah. No, no. Don't you get any ideas, ok? No, I'm not setting you up with any more of my friends!
joey_tribbiani OW, why, why, why?
phoebe_buffay Because you'll date her once, sleep with her and then forget she exists!
joey_tribbiani Oh, name one friend of yours that I did that with.
phoebe_buffay Mandy.
joey_tribbiani Mandy, uh? Uh... really hot blonde, big boobs?
phoebe_buffay No.
joey_tribbiani I know why I don't remember her, huh?
rachel_green Do you think I'm someone else?
joey_tribbiani Ok, I may not have treated your friends well in the past, but I have grown up a lot, really. Honest, Rach?
rachel_green Well, believe it or not, it's true. When Joey and I were together, he was wonderful. He was thoughtful and mature. And for the one week that we went out, he didn't sleep with anybody else!
joey_tribbiani Growth!
phoebe_buffay Fine, I'll give you her number.
joey_tribbiani Ok, thank you. And I promise you I will not forget this one. Mandy.
phoebe_buffay SARAH!
joey_tribbiani Saraaah.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
rachel_green Hi!
dr_ross_geller Hey you guys, I need some fashion advice.
rachel_green Oh!
dr_ross_geller How does this look?
rachel_green Well, it's a little low... pick up a little... a little bit more... a little bit more... There you go! Now throw it away!
dr_ross_geller C'mon! This looks good!
rachel_green Ross, please, trust me. I buy 30 fashion magazines a month. Now, I don't know who's running for president or who that... NATO guy is, but I do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat.
dr_ross_geller Damnit! I have this date tomorrow night and I have to look cool!
phoebe_buffay Well, you know, if you want fashion help, Rachel and I are going shopping tomorrow. You're more than welcome to come with us, right?
dr_ross_geller Really? That would be great. I mean, I have to do something, she kinda teased me about how I dress.
joey_tribbiani I can see why, nice shirt!
dr_ross_geller You're wearing the same shirt.
joey_tribbiani Stupid Gap on every corner!
adoption_agency_worker Please, make yourself comfortable and I will back in a moment with Erica.
monica_geller Ok, thank you. Uh, well this is it. Are you OK?
chandler_bing Yeah. Just weird, you know. It's like: "Hi, I'm Chandler. May I have the human growing inside you?"
monica_geller Uh, we're gonna be great.
chandler_bing You're gonna be great.
monica_geller Well... obviously!
adoption_agency_worker Monica, Chandler. I'd like you to meet Erica.
monica_geller Hi. It is so, so nice to meet you.
erica Hi...
chandler_bing Thank you so much for agreeing to see us.
erica Hi.
adoption_agency_worker I'll let you get acquainted.
chandler_bing Ok.
erica So, it's Monica and Chandler. I only know you as file 0W33815-D.
chandler_bing That's what our friends call us.
erica Gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. It's... kind of intimidating.
monica_geller I don't know about that.
erica You're kidding me? I mean, it's enough that you are a doctor. But on top of it, you're married to a reverend?
chandler_bing I don't think that's exactly...
monica_geller Let her finish, doctor.
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey.
phoebe_buffay Oh, my friend Sarah had a great time last night.
joey_tribbiani Well...
phoebe_buffay Yeah! So you're gonna call this one back?
joey_tribbiani Nope.
phoebe_buffay What are you talking about? Sarah's great!
joey_tribbiani Oh, really? You know what your great friend did? We're out to dinner, ok? We're getting along, having a really nice time. I was thinking she was really cool. And then, out of nowhere...
phoebe_buffay That's it? That's why you won't go out with her again? So, she took some fries, big deal!
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, look! It's not about a few fries... it's about what the fries represent.
phoebe_buffay What?
joey_tribbiani ALL FOOD!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I can't believe I set you up with such a MONSTER!
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look. I take a girl out, she can order whatever she wants! The more, the better! All right? Just don't order a Garden salad and then eat my food! That's a good way to lose some fingers!
phoebe_buffay Oh
rachel_green Hi
phoebe_buffay Thank God you're here. Listen to this!
rachel_green what?
phoebe_buffay Joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries...
rachel_green Oh! Oh, no!
phoebe_buffay What? You know about the plate thing?
rachel_green Oh, yeah. Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and..
phoebe_buffay You wouldn't let her have a grape?
rachel_green Oh no! Not me! Emma!
joey_tribbiani JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
phoebe_buffay Well, I still think that it's a stupid reason not to call someone again. You are calling her! And if you need to, just get an extra plate of fries for the table!
joey_tribbiani I like that! A sharing buffer! Yeah! I'll order some extra fries! Maybe a plate of onion rings. Yeah. And a shrimp cocktail. And some buffalo wings. Maybe an individual pizza, uh? And some mozzarella sticks. What were we talking about?
phoebe_buffay This place is awesome!
dr_ross_geller You know, we should just go, I'm not gonna find anything here! This stuff is ridiculous!
rachel_green Ah, this place is great!
phoebe_buffay Wow!
dr_ross_geller Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wear any of this! Nothing silver. Ok? Nothing with hair! And nothing with padlocks on it!
rachel_green Ross, look, I know that some of this stuff is out there, but I mean, come on, look at this, look at this sweater! I mean, this is just beautiful!
dr_ross_geller Wow, this is really soft Three hundred and fifty dollars?
rachel_green Yeah, down from seven hundred, you are saving like two hundred bucks!
dr_ross_geller Both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.
phoebe_buffay Hey, check this out! It's totally you!
dr_ross_geller Wow!
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Actually this looks like pretty good! Yeah! Boys will be boys?
phoebe_buffay What? They will be!
dr_ross_geller All right, that's it, I'm getting out of here.
rachel_green No, no, no, no! Ross, wait! Come on! You know, there's other stuff. Here's a nice shirt, look at these nice pants...
dr_ross_geller Uh, actually these might look pretty good on me.
rachel_green Yes, they will! You know what you should do? Just go take a walk, all right? I know your size and I'm... I'm gonna pick up some really good stuff for you.
dr_ross_geller Really?
rachel_green Yes! And I know what looks sexy on guys. Please, just wear what I suggest, and she's gonna go nuts for you.
dr_ross_geller So, you're saying, uh, if I wear these pants I might be getting into hers?
rachel_green Why do men keep talking to me like this?
chandler_bing So, the fact that I am a doctor, and my wife's a reverend, that's important to you?
erica Yeah, I read some great applications, but then I thought "who better then a minister to raise a child!"
monica_geller Amen.
chandler_bing Plus I thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!
monica_geller Uh, good hands. Healing hands.
erica Reverend, can I ask? Does the bible say anything about adoption?
monica_geller It says "Do it!". And behold she did adopt onto them a baby. And it was good.
erica Wow.
chandler_bing Yeah, wow.
erica I was wondering you both have such serious jobs. Would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?
monica_geller Oh, you know, my flock is good, I mean, yeah, my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point. Good flock. Flock, flock, flock.
erica Being a doctor must take up a lot of time.
chandler_bing No-ot for me it doesn't.
adoption_agency_worker So, how's everything going in here?
erica We're great, I think I may have asked all my questions.
adoption_agency_worker Do you have any question for Erica?
chandler_bing Yeah, actually. So, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?
adoption_agency_worker Yes, our system assures total anonimity. We're very proud of it.
chandler_bing You should be. You're really on top of stuff..
adoption_agency_worker Well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.
erica Actually, I don't think we have to.
monica_geller We don't?
erica Yeah, when I read about you two, I was pretty sure I wanted you, but I just thought we should meet face to face. I've made my decision. I choose them.
monica_geller Oh my God, this is great! This is so great! Did you hear that?
chandler_bing Yeah, I did.
monica_geller Hey, thank you. Thank you so much. You are SO going to Heaven!
rachel_green We got some really great stuff!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, yeah but I am not sure about some of the bra's I got.
rachel_green Oh! Really? Do you wanna try some of them on for me?
phoebe_buffay Oh! okay. Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?
rachel_green Oh no! I took one of Ross' bags by mistake, and one of mine is missing.
phoebe_buffay oh, well, Ross probably has it, you can get it from him later.
dr_ross_geller So? What do you think?
joey_tribbiani I think were not wearing the same shirt anymore!!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Yeah! Rachel picked it out for me. She told me to trust her and you know what? I'm glad I did! I turned quite a few heads on my way over here.
joey_tribbiani Dude, I really don't think you should be wearing that.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I see, somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies?
joey_tribbiani Looks like someone IS the ladies!!
dr_ross_geller You're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off. Yeah, now if you'll excuse me I have a date. See? ALL eyes on ME!
chandler_bing We are NOT signing those papers.
monica_geller Why not?
chandler_bing It's wrong. They made a mistake. They think we're somebody else.
monica_geller God works in mysterious ways.
chandler_bing You have gotta stop!
monica_geller But she liked us.
chandler_bing She likes Doctor Chandler and Reverend Monica.
monica_geller Well, if you think about it, I am kind of like a Reverend. I mean, as a chef, I serve God, by feeing the hungry and poor.
chandler_bing Your Veal Chop is $34,95!
monica_geller C'mon Chandler, I think we have been given an opportunity. I mean, the mistake has already been made. They are writing up the paper right now.
chandler_bing But we are not the one she chose! How can you feel okay about this?
monica_geller Because... We may not be who she thinks we are but no-one will ever love that baby more than us.
chandler_bing I know..
monica_geller I mean, who knows how long it's gonna take for someone else to give us a baby? What if, what if no one ever picks us?
chandler_bing oh, honey..
monica_geller Please.. please, we are so close.
chandler_bing Monica, I want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. She deserves to know who it's going to. Monica: okay, right.
chandler_bing So, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.
monica_geller Maybe she will. Uh! Why couldn't I have been a Reverend?
chandler_bing You're Jewish.
monica_geller Technicality!
the_waiter A garden salad for the lady
joey_tribbiani Oh, that looks great! Good ordering!
the_waiter Seafood platter for the gentleman and extra fries. Enjoy!
sarah Mmmh, those fries look delicious.
joey_tribbiani oh, I didn't know you liked French fries. Help yourself! What's mine is yours.
sarah Oh wow, are those stuffed clams?
joey_tribbiani Uuuh.. yes, they are my stuffed clams.
joey_tribbiani How about those fries though, huh?
sarah They are delicious
joey_tribbiani You are beautiful, you know that?
sarah Oh, that is so sweet..
joey_tribbiani Oh okay..
joey_tribbiani NOW look what you did!!
sarah What? what is the matter with you?
joey_tribbiani I don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?
sarah But you just said "What's mine is yours"?
joey_tribbiani WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN IT!
sarah Fine, I'm sorry, I didn't think it was that big a deal.
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry, I'm overreacting. Okay, It's just when it comes to food, I have certain rules, okay, I mean There are things you do..and you now, things.. that you don't do
girl#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode09 Wow, this place looks great.
dr_ross_geller Oh! You are gonna love it! and I'm so glad, we're finally doing this.
girl#unknown#Friends.Season10.Episode09 Me too!
dr_ross_geller Here So this was fun!
joey_tribbiani I really am sorry about, you know..before. I just want to make sure you know that I really do like you.
sarah Sure Just not as much as clams.
joey_tribbiani Well, stuffed clams.
the_waiter Chocolate Torte for the lady, cheesecake for the gentleman.
joey_tribbiani Uh, excuse me sir, there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.
the_waiter Yes, that's Raspberry coule.
joey_tribbiani So stupid, ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.
sarah Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani Oh, all right, I'll just have what she's having instead.
the_waiter Oh, I'm sorry sir, that was our last piece.
sarah Mmmm! Mmm!
sarah Oh, no! This is work. I should call in. Can you excuse me?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah, sure. No problem.
sarah What are you doing? I thought you don't share food.
joey_tribbiani Sure I do. Coule?
sarah No. If I can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert. This is a two way street.
joey_tribbiani Really?
sarah Really! Now this all better be here when I come back.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, of course. I can control myself.
joey_tribbiani Stop staring at me!
joey_tribbiani Why, just a tiny little...
joey_tribbiani Oh-oh!
joey_tribbiani I'm not even sorry.
erica Hi!
adoption_agency_worker Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
adoption_agency_worker So, these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. There's a lot to go over, but I'll explain everything as we go through it.
monica_geller I-Is... Is that a picture?
erica Yeah. It's a sonogram they took of the baby last week. I thought you might want to see it.
monica_geller Look, doctor!
adoption_agency_worker I don't understand.
chandler_bing The agency must have made some mistake. My wife is not a reverend and I'm not a doctor.
erica What?
adoption_agency_worker That's impossible.
chandler_bing I could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.
adoption_agency_worker I'll go check your file. Excuse me.
erica So who are you?
chandler_bing Well, our names really are Monica and Chandler. We're from New York.
monica_geller Yeah, but the important thing to know about us, is how much we would care for this little baby.
erica So you lied to me before?
monica_geller Well, we... "bore false witness"... See I could be a reverend.
erica I can't believe this.
monica_geller But we were hoping that since we told you the truth that you still might consider...
erica Giving you my baby? You think I'd give you my child after this?
monica_geller Well, you don't have to decide right now, but if you could just look at our file...
erica I don't want to look at your file! This is over.
chandler_bing Erica wait!
erica I've nothing to say to you.
chandler_bing You have every reason to be upset. We did lie. But only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. Now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.
erica Why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?
chandler_bing Erica, please. Just consider us. Ask them to see our file. Our last name's Bing. My wife's a chef and I'm in advertising.
erica Oh yeah. I actually liked you guys. But it doesn't matter, because what you did was wrong.
chandler_bing But you did like us. And you should. My wife's an incredible woman. She's loving and devoted and caring. And don't tell her I said this but the woman's always right... I love my wife more than anything in this world. And I... It kills me that I can't give her a baby... I really want a kid. And when that day finally comes, I'll learn how to be a good dad. But my wife... she's already there. She's a mother... without a baby... Please?
chandler_bing You still want that baby?
monica_geller God bless you Chandler Bing!
dr_ross_geller Turns out this sweater is made for a woman.
joey_tribbiani So, why are you still wearing it?
dr_ross_geller Because it's soft... Hey, so how was your date?
joey_tribbiani Ooh... Not so good.
dr_ross_geller Well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh old buddy?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, and you know what? We could do a lot worse.
joey_tribbiani JOEY DOESN'T SHARE FOOD!
