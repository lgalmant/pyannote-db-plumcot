joey Hey! You guys! You're not gonna believe this! I just got off the phone with my agent

joey Okay. I got nominated for my part on Days of Our Lives!
monica Joey!
phoebe Good for you!
monica Congratulations! Wow! I can't believe you're nominated for an Emmy!
joey No-no.
monica Oh Soap Opera Digest award!
joey No! I'm up for a Soapie!
monica Honey? Is that something you're making up?
joey No, no, no! It's real! And it has been since 1998. Hey Rach! Rach! I'm up for a Soapie!
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God!! That is like the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!
joey Thank you! Well, I guess now I know who I'm taking to the awards.
rachel Oh, stop that! Don't kid about that! Will all the stars be there?
joey Many are scheduled to appear.
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God! I can't go! I'm gonna be too nervous!
monica Okay, I'll go!
rachel No!! You are getting married! This is all I have.
ross and it was Ernst Muhlbrat who first hypothesized that the Velociraptor would expand it's collar and emit a high pitched noise to frighten it's predator. Yes Mr. Lewis?
lewis What kinda noise?
ross Just a high pitched intimidating noise.
lewis But like how?
ross Well we-we don't know for sure. But in my head it-it sounded something like this. Of course, this is just conjecture. Okay, that's uh, that's all for today. Uh Mr. Morse, can I see you for a moment?
morse Yes sir.
ross Mr. Morse I need to talk to you about your mid-term exam, I'm afraid I-I had to fail you.
morse Why?!
ross Well you need 60% to pass
morse What'd I get?
ross Seven.
morse That's not so good.
ross No-no it's not. What-what happened there Ned?
morse Well maybe you can cut me some slack. I'm sort of in love.
ross Well I'm sorry but, that-that's really not my problem.
morse I'm in love with you.
ross Well that brings me in the loop a little.
morse You see, that's why I did so bad on this test. I'm having a hard time concentrating. When you're up there and you're teaching and your face gets all serious... you look so good. You wear that tight little turtleneck sweater
ross Okay! Umm, I uh, I'm your teacher. I'm sorry, you're-you're a student and I-and I like women. In spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.
phoebe Oh my God! That guy at the counter is totally checking you out!
monica Really? My God, he's really cute.
phoebe Go for it.
monica Phoebe, I'm engaged!
phoebe I'm just saying, get his number just in case. But no Chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually and he would want you to take a lover to satisfy the needs that he can no longer fulfill.
the_cute_guy Hi!
monica Op, can I just tell you something? Very flattered but umm, I'm engaged.
the_cute_guy Wow! Uh, this is kind of embarrassing. I was actually coming over to talk to your friend.
monica Well you should be embarrassed.
the_cute_guy I thought you knew I was looking at you.
phoebe I did, but that was really fun.
joey And the winner is... Joey Tribbiani! Oh... Wow! I honestly never expected this. I uh, I didn't prepare a speech. But umm, I'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me. I'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Phoebe, Rachel
rachel I'm fourth! Look at you with your little maple syrup award!
joey Yeah may-maybe you don't tell anyone about this.
rachel What? No! It's not a big deal! I do that too, with my shampoo bottle.
joey Really?
rachel Yeah.
joey What award are you practicing for?
rachel Grammy, Best New Artist.
joey Oh, hey listen! The Soapie's called today and I also get to present an award.
rachel Ohh that's great!
joey Yeah!
rachel So you'll definitely get onstage, even if you don't win.
joey What you-you don't think I'm gonna win?
rachel Well of course I do! But y'know, favorite returning character is a tough category Joey. I mean you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.
joey Yeah. No-no I-I know I might not win, but it's just... I've never even been nominated before! I want it so much.
rachel Well Joey, you'll probably get it. But you should probably your-your gracious loser face. Y'know when like the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed but also that your colleague deserved to win. Y'know? So it's sorta like
joey Hey!
rachel Y'know?
joey You practice losing the Grammies too?
rachel Oh no, at the Grammies I always win.
joey Ah.
phoebe Oh hey!
monica Hey! How'd your date go with Jake?
phoebe Oh, great! We couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y'know, he'd kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck.
monica Okay, stop it Phoebe, you're getting me all tingly.
phoebe All I could think of was y'know, "Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?"
monica And did he?
phoebe I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.
monica Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.
phoebe I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.
monica Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler. Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again am I?
phoebe You sound like a guy.
monica No, a guy would be saying, "I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." Oh my God! I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else! I've been so busy planning the wedding that I forgot about all the things that I'd be giving up! I mean, I... I'm never gonna have a first kiss again.
phoebe You'll have a last kiss.
ross Can I ask you something? Have you ever had a guy have a crush on you?
joey Is that why you wanted to tie my tie?
ross There's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.
joey Whoa!
rachel Whoa what?
joey Ross has a boyfriend.
ross I do-I do not have a boyfriend. There's a guy in one of my classes who-who has a crush on me.
rachel Really?
ross Yeah! I don't know. I mean, last year Elizabeth now-now this kid. What-what-what-what is it?! Am I giving out some kind of... sexy professor vibe?
rachel Not right now.
ross It-it - The point is my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.
rachel Oh, see now I feel bad for the kid! I had a crush on a teacher once and it was so hard! Y'know you - I couldn't concentrate and I blushed every time he looked at me. I mean come on, you remember what's it's like to be 19 and in love.
ross Yeah. I guess I can cut him some slack.
rachel Yeah.
joey How'd you get over that teacher?
rachel I didn't. I got under him.
joey Problem solved.
jake Bye Phoebe.
phoebe Okay bye.
jake All right. Bye.
phoebe Bye! We said good-bye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.
monica Phoebe, it's okay. You don't have to tip toe around me. I-I've been thinking about it and umm, y'know what? I'm okay about not having that new relationship feeling
jake I miss you already!!
phoebe I miss you too!!!!
monica See? That's what I mean. I mean that, that's great! But I wouldn't trade in what I have for that. I mean I'm gonna be with Chandler for the rest of my life, and that's what makes me happy. Hey sweetie, come here! Come sit down. Hey Phoebe and I were just talking about how our relationship is deep and meaningful. It really is don't you think?
chandler Oh totally! Pull my finger.

the_presenter in the category of Favorite Returning Male Character the nominees are
joey What the?!
announcer Presenting the award for Favorite Supporting Actress is Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives.
joey Any one of the brilliant actresses nominated for this award tonight deserves to take it home. Unfortunately only one can. The nominees for Best Supporting Actress are from Passions Erin Goff. From One Life to Live Mary Loren Bishop , from All My Children Sarah Mchann, and from Days of Our Lives Jessica Ashley. And the winner is... ... Jessica Ashley from Days of Our Lives. Uh, unfortunately Jessica couldn't be with us tonight so I'll be accepting this award on her behalf. And I'm sure that Jessica would like to thank my parents who always believed in me. She'd also like to thank my friends, Chandler, Monica, Ross, Phoebe, and Rachel who's sittin' right there!
rachel Joey! Why did we have to rush out of there so fast?!
joey Rach we had to get out of there because, look what I won!
rachel Oh my God you stole her award!
joey No-no! No, I'm accepting it on her behalf.
rachel Joey I don't think you know what behalf means.
joey Sure I do! It's a verb! As in, "I behalfin' it!"
rachel Joey, you have got to take this back!
joey But why?! I should've won one and I really want it and she didn't even care enough to come to the thing! It could also be a Grammy.
rachel No! Joey!
joey Come on Rach! No one saw me take it! There was a whole table full of 'em.
rachel Do you really want an award you didn't win?
joey No! I want an award I did win! But nobody's giving me any of those! Plus - Hey Rach, if-if I put it up there right? When people come over they'll see it and they'll think I won it.
rachel Joey is says Best Supporting Actress!
joey I can scratch that right off.
rachel Joey no, this is wrong! You have to take it back, okay? You don't want to win an award this way. You're very talented. And someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.
joey All right!
rachel All right? Thank you.
joey I'll take it back tomorrow.
rachel Thank you.
joey If I can't have it you can't have it!
lewis Professor Geller?
ross Yes Mr. Lewis, how can I help you?
lewis I know I didn't do well on my midterms and stuff but, I was kinda hoping you could change my grade.
ross And why exactly would I do that?
lewis Because I'm in love with you.
ross What?!
lewis Yeah, I'm all... in love with you and stuff. So could you change my grade?
ross No!
lewis Well why not you changed Ned's grade!
ross Well that's different! Okay? Because he, he was actually in love with me!
lewis No he's not! He's totally yanking your chain! He's done this with three other teachers!
ross What?
lewis He's got a girlfriend!
ross I can't believe someone would do that for a grade.
lewis I know! It's awful. I love you.
monica Have you seen Chandler?
phoebe No. Why?
monica 'Cause I just keeping thinking about all these things that I'm not gonna have and it's freaking me out. I don't know what to do about it.
phoebe Okay, don't sweat it. Chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system. That guy's cute.
monica Phoebe! Come on I'm serious! I just got to talk to him about all this.
phoebe No that is the last thing you want to do!
monica Why?
phoebe Because you're marrying him!
monica You gotta help me out here Pheebs.
phoebe All right, I've never been engaged and I've never really been married, but I can only tell you what my mother told me. Whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship, do not communicate them to your husband.
monica So I'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with?
phoebe That is correct! Yes, you're supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight.
monica Your mother told you this?
phoebe Yes!
monica The woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?
phoebe Oh my God! You're right! Go! Go tell Chandler! Hurry before it's too late! Wait no! Does this also mean putting out doesn't get you love?
rachel I cannot believe I'm gonna meet Jessica Ashley!
joey Okay wait-wait p-please be cool! Okay? I work with this woman.
rachel Okay, I'm totally cool!
jessica_ashley Come in.
joey Hey Jessica.
rachel Hey Jess.
joey Ah, this is my friend Rachel.
jessica_ashley Hi.
rachel 'Sup?
joey Uh listen, here's your Soapie. I accepted it for ya.
jessica_ashley Oh my God! I won! Do you have any idea what this means?!
joey Well, that-that-that's it? You're gonna, you're gonna put it on your self or anything?
jessica_ashley No, I try to save that for real awards. Now, if you'll excuse me.
joey Take it back?
rachel Absolutely.
joey Y-y-yeah! Yeah you do.
monica Honey, as we get closer to the wedding, is there anything that you would like to talk about or share?
chandler Okay. Well, I think the centerpieces are too big
monica You're wrong! The centerpieces are fine! Do you ever get scared at all?
chandler Kinda. They're really big.
monica Doesn't it ever just freak you out that-that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?
chandler What?
monica Just, I love you so much. Just... It's just sometimes it bothers me that I'm never gonna have that feeling. Y'know when you meet someone for the first time and it's new and exciting? Y'know that rush?
chandler No. No, see when I first meet somebody it's uh it's mostly panic, anxiety, and a great deal of sweating.
monica Okay, but all right you're a guy, does it not freak you that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?
chandler Sleeping with somebody new, anxiety, panic, and I'm afraid even more sweating.
monica Even with me?
chandler I was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship. Look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
monica Really?
chandler Well yeah! But now that I know that you're having these thoughts, I'm back to panic, anxiety, and uh I'm definitely gonna need some kind of sports drink.
monica Come here! Come here! Sweetie you don't have to worry. No, besides y'know what? I'm gonna have a lot of new things with you. The first time we buy a house. Our first kid. Our first grandkid
chandler Water! Water! Water!

morse That was a great lecture today. Did you get a little hair cut?
ross Uh-hmm, yeah-yeah do you like it? Do-do you looove it? I just want you to know that I'm changing your grade back.
morse What?! Why?
ross 'Cause I know what you're trying to pull here. Okay? It's not gonna work.
morse I'm not trying to pull anything. Look I love you dude.
ross Y'know what? I-I'm not even gonna talk about this. Okay? This little thing is over. I know you have a girlfriend! Okay - - Yeah! And I know about the other professors! How do you think that makes me feel Ned?! You used me! You don't love me and you never did! Ah Professor Winston, Professor Fredrickson, I'll be right with you. Don't make this worse and I'll give you a C. Shall we?
