joey Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?
monica Ok.
joey Alright!
monica But ehm...what is it not?
joey A place to entertain my lady friends.
monica And what else is it not?
joey A place to eat spaghetti.
monica Very good! What do you need it for anyway?
joey Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...
rachel Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?
joey Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.
monica Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!
joey Uh!
monica Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.
chandler Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!
phoebe Hey will you get me tickets too?
rachel Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it!
ross No thanks!
phoebe You don't wanna win the lottery?
ross Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.
chandler Still on Amelia Earhart?
ross The woman just vanished!
joey Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?
ross No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.
chandler Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.
joey I like those odds!
ross Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.
chandler I'll ask. Boohaki?
ross Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.
rachel Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.
monica How do you know she's gonna start talking?
rachel Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.
chandler Kinda like Joey.
joey What's that now?
monica God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.
chandler Pie eating contest?
monica Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?
chandler No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.
monica That was a good day!
ross They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!
monica I'm parked in a garage on Morton!
ross They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.
joey Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?
rachel Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!
joey I was?
racel Yes and you talked to her...
joey I did?
rachel She dropped off a casserole?
joey Oh yeah! The casserole lady.
monica So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?
ross Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!
chandler Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!
ross Think he washed his hands?
chandler Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?
rachel What's going on?
monica Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.
joey Ooh! Tough odds!
ross Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!
joey Look who's coming around!
chandler Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.
joey Did you get it?
chandler One of the slots got filled.
joey By you!?
chandler Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.
monica Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!
chandler Yeah I know.
rachel Well, there's two spots left right?
chandler Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.
phoebe Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!
monica Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.
ross A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!
monica Alright, who wants to do it?
phoebe Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!
monica Ok, hey Rach?
rachel Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.
joey I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.
phoebe I hope I win!
monica Well, it doesn't really matter.. you're both wishing for the same thing, right?
joey I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!
monica Right!. but we "know" what you're wishing for!
joey Can't really say!
monica I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?
joey I'm not really comfortable with these questions!
rachel_chandler_and_monica Please, just do it!
phoebe One, two, three!
joey I won, hey!
ross You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!
rachel You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?
ross Uh, you're not gonna win.
rachel Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like "oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape" and you're gonna be all like "oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai"
ross Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.
chandler I can see the headline now: "Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm".
ross Why would I eat my own arm?
chandler Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.
monica You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.
ross Why?
monica Because I know that you think the lottery is "boohaki" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.
ross You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here
phoebe Get a room!
chandler Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?
ross I don't know, probably just invest it.
chandler Ooh! Calm down..
joey Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?
ross Oh, I'm sorry, did I say "invest it"? I meant "be cool and piss it all away"
joey Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!
rachel I don't really care about the Knicks.
joey Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.
rachel You would do that? I never get picked!
chandler You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.
joey You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!
chandler You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.
ross Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?
chandler I'll take this one too Uh.. Mommy?
ross Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel "Mommy" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not..
rachel I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.
ross Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "Daddy" too.
phoebe Oooh, I like that, "daddy"
ross I.. I was just talking about Rachel.
phoebe Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?
ross Well that depends.. have you been a baaad gi. no I can't.
chandler Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear?.. What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!!. Alright, bye.
joey Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?
chandler Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.
monica Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!
chandler He's the boss's son.
monica Come on, lottery!!
rachel Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.
monica Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.
rachel Ooh, I have another idea!
monica I'm sorry, idea time is over.
phoebe Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?
monica Yeah.
chandler What about the ones you have on the nightstand?
monica There are no tickets on the nightstand!
chandler Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.
monica Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!
chandler Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!
monica Chandler, sense the tone!!
rachel Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!
monica Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.
phoebe Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.
ross I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!
monica Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!
ross 3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important..
joey I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?
monica When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!
joey I'll show you how.
rachel Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your "special" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?
monica Please.. if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!
rachel Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?
chandler She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us..
monica Ahhh!
chandler Let me finish.. however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!
monica There's the man I married!!
rachel All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!
monica Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!
rachel OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !
joey Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!
ross Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.
phoebe Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together
monica No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!
joey Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!
chandler Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!
rachel Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!
joey Oh!
phoebe OOOOOHHHHH!
ross Hey, hey!!
phoebe OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!
rachel Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.
joey No, no!
phoebe If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets!
everyone NO!!
phoebe Don't come any closer!
chandler Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...
phoebe No, what's more important, your friends or money?
everyone_but_monica Friends!
monica Money! Friends...
phoebe Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?
monica They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra..
ross Monica!
phoebe Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.
ross Go, go, go!!
phoebe What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.
monica Phoebe, we lost half of them.
phoebe So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?
ross Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...
phoebe As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.
chandler Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!
monica Oh, play them!
chandler Ok, here we go!
message "Hello. Th-this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologise" "I sh.. I shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand. It-it was all my fault. Not hers. Bye. Coo."
phoebe Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.
second_message "Hey Chandler, it's Charlie"
chandler This is..shhh!
second_message "Listen, oh... it turns I got the last spot. I'm really sorry man, it was a lot of fun working with you. Give me a call if you want."
monica Oh God, I am so sorry honey...
all Oh, so sorry man! Sorry!
rachel Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.
chandler Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?
rachel No, she was just much better at job than me!
phoebe Guys, the drawing is about to start!
rachel You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.
ross Oh yeah, it's a good idea!
monica Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.
chandler Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?
monica 131!
ross Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...
rachel Hi mum, put her back on!
joey Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing.
tv "Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53"
chandler I got that!
ross Oh, we have one too!!
monica We are on a roll, people!!
ross Come on!!
rachel Mum, please!I know you love your new lips, but I can barely understand you! Would you, please, just let me say goodnight to my daughter?
tv "And number 29! Here we go! The Powerball is 7"
monica Check your numbers! Make me rich!
rachel Guys, you're not gonna believe this! I was just saying goodnight to Emma and she said her first words!!
all Wow!
joey And what did she say?
rachel She said "gleba"!!
monica Make me rich!!
rachel Isn't that amazing?
ross Oh yeah, no no no...that's great!
rachel Why-why aren't you more excited?
ross Oh, Rach...oh..."gleba" is not a word.
rachel Oh, but of course it is!
ross Okay, what does it mean?
rachel I don't know all the words.
ross I'm just, I'm just glad I didn't miss my daughter's first words
ross Yes you did, gleba is a word!
ross Ok, use it in a sentence.
rachel Ok... "Emma just said gleba"!
ross It's not a word!
rachel Okay, okay, okay, fine, I'm gonna look it up
ross Oh, oh, ok, great. You know what, while you're at it she said another word the other day, why don't you, why don't you look up: pbbqqt....
rachel Alright, okay, okay, gleba, gleba... Gleba! Ha! Here it is: the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.
ross She's gonna be a scientist!
joey Damnit! anybody got anything?
chandler No.
phoebe I'm still looking through mine...
monica Just double checking..no, no, no... No!
monica Hello? Hold on. It's your boss.
chandler Ah, the "I'm sorry I rejected you" phone call. I'm not used to getting it from guys. Hey, Steve.
steve Chandler, hi! I'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions. We just felt that with your maturity and experience, you wouldn't be happy being someone's assistant.
chandler Oh no no no no, I'd love to be somebody's assistant! Answering phones, getting coffee, I live for that stuff! And I'm not too mature... farts, boobies, butt cracks!
steve Chandler, you were the strongest person in the program. We're offering you the position of junior copywriter.
chandler Me, that guy who just said butt cracks?
steve Yes, that's right. We're excited about the level of sophistication you'll be bringing to the job.
chandler Ok well, thanks, you won't regret it. I'll see you tomorrow
chandler What? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be a junior copywriter.
everybody Oh my God, congratulations!
monica Oh sweetie, I'm so proud of you!
chandler Does that mean I get the good loving tonight?
monica You bet! No TV or anything!
joey Hey, that is so great about the job.
chandler Thanks, man.
joey And I like to think I had a little something to do with it.
chandler Really? What?
joey Well, before, with the wishbone... I didn't wish we would win the lottery, I wished you'd get the job.
chandler Oh yeah? Listen, don't tell Monica, she'll rip your heart right out.
joey Oh yeah.
rachel You know what? There is a little part of me that really thought we were gonna win.
ross Me too. So much for my dinosaur/Amelia Earhart theme park.
phoebe You guys, what was the Powerball number again?
monica_and_ross Seven.
phoebe We won.
rachel What?
phoebe We won!
monica Let me see!
phoebe Don't tear it.
ross Phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers.
phoebe I know that, but look, we've got the Powerball number, we've won 3 dollars!
chandler Wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout.
phoebe I don't care, I've never won anything before, I can't believe this!
rachel So Pheebs, what are you going to do with your $3?
phoebe It's not all mine. We all get 50 cents.
monica You know what? You can have mine.
chandler Me too.
joey Me too.
rachel Me too.
ross I guess if everybody else is...
joey Hey guys, so I just called the Powerball hotline, can you believe it? Nobody won.
phoebe I beg to differ
gunther Maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier, and he found the ticket on the street, right outside, and won $10,000
phoebe Coo, again. Don't blame the pretty lady. It was not her fault. It was me, the pigeon, coo! Seriously, stop staring at her.
