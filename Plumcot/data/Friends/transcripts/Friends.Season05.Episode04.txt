monica_geller Come in. I've been waiting for you.
rachel_green Hi! I just wanna--Ahhh!!! Oh my God! Oh my God!
monica_geller Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I-I-I was um, I was taking a nap.
rachel_green Since when do take naps in that position. Oh God Monica, tell me you were waiting for a guy! Please tell me you were waiting for a guy!
monica_geller Yes. Yes, I was. A guy. From work. I'm seeing a guy from work! Ha!
rachel_green That cute waiter guy from your restaurant, the one that looks like a non-threatening Ray Liotta?
monica_geller Uh-huh, that one!
rachel_green Y'know what, just give me a second and I'll be out of your hair. I'm just gonna grab a jacket. When I get back, I want every little detail. Maybe that's him.
monica_geller Okay, umm, okay, umm... It's just Joey and Ross.
rachel_green Why aren't you guys at the movie?
joey_tribbiani Well, we were! But Ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out!
dr_ross_geller I had to talk loud because the movie was loud!
joey_tribbiani He's talking to London!
monica_geller But why?! Did he get in touch with Emily?
joey_tribbiani Well no, not yet. He's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
dr_ross_geller I-I-I don't care if I said some other girl's name you prissy, old twit!
joey_tribbiani Ross! Way to suck up to the family.
chandler_bing Ha-ha-ha--enh-enh. I'm so glad you guys are all here! My office finally got wrinkle free fax paper!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Oh no-no-no-no-no-no, vomit tux! No-no, vomit tux!
joey_tribbiani Don't worry, I had it dry-cleaned.
monica_geller Vomit tux? Who vomited on-y'know what, what you up to Joe?
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm doing this telethon thing on TV and my agent got me a job as co-host!
monica_geller Oh that's great!
joey_tribbiani A little uh, good deed for PBS and a little TV exposure, now that's the kind of math Joey likes to do!
phoebe_buffay Ugh, PBS!
monica_geller What's wrong with PBS?
phoebe_buffay Ugh, what's right with them?
joey_tribbiani Why don't you like PBS, Pheebs?
phoebe_buffay Okay, 'cause right after my mom killed herself, I was just in this really bad place, y'know personally. So, I just thought that it'd make me feel better if I wrote to Sesame Street, 'cause they were so nice when I was a little kid! No one ever wrote back.
chandler_bing Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.
phoebe_buffay All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.
phoebe_buffay This isn't a good deed, you just wanted to get on TV! This is totally selfish.
joey_tribbiani Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!
phoebe_buffay What-what are you talking about?!
joey_tribbiani Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. So?
joey_tribbiani It made you feel good, so that makes it selfish. Look, there's no unselfish good deeds, sorry.
phoebe_buffay Yes there are! There are totally good deeds that are selfless.
joey_tribbiani Well, may I ask for one example?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's... Y'know there's-no you may not!
joey_tribbiani That's because all people are selfish.
phoebe_buffay Are you calling me selfish?!
joey_tribbiani Are you calling you people? Yeah, well sorry to burst that bubble, Pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist. Okay? And you the deal on Santa Clause right?
phoebe_buffay I'm gonna find a selfless good dead. I'm gonna beat you, you evil genius.
dr_ross_geller Hello.
emily_waltham Hello, Ross?
dr_ross_geller Emily? Emily! Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Emily! It's Emily everyone! Shush-shush-shhst! Hi!
emily_waltham Ross, I'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. Good-bye!
dr_ross_geller No wait! Look, wait! Okay, you can hang up, but I'm gonna keep calling! I'm gonna, I'm gonna call everyone in England if that's what it takes to get you to talk to me!
emily_waltham Really? About what?
dr_ross_geller Look you're my wife. We're-we're married. Y'know? I-I love you. I-I really miss you.
emily_waltham I miss you to. Well, at least I think I do.
dr_ross_geller She's talking.
all@ Yay!
phoebe_buffay Hey, Joey, when you said the deal with Santa Clause, you meant?
joey_tribbiani That he doesn't exist.
phoebe_buffay Right.
rachel_green So Chandler, have you heard about Monica's secret boyfriend?
chandler_bing Uhh, yeah. She uh, she uh, she uh might've mentioned him.
rachel_green So Mon, when are we gonna meet this new secret waiter man?
monica_geller Ohh, he's really shy. I-I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
chandler_bing Yeah, I don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.
rachel_green I don't care! I wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had!
chandler_bing Really?! That's what you heard? You said that?
monica_geller I might've said that. Why is that funny?
chandler_bing Because I'm very happy for him! And you, you lucky dog!
dr_ross_geller Hi!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Well, Emily's willing to work on the relationship.
chandler_bing Yes!
monica_geller That's great!
dr_ross_geller In London!
monica_geller What?!
dr_ross_geller She wants me to move to London.
monica_geller But you live here! You know that.
rachel_green What-what-what are you gonna do?
dr_ross_geller I bet if I talk to Carol and Susan I can convince them to move to London with Ben.
monica_geller Yeah, I'm sure your ex-wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife.
dr_ross_geller It could happen.
joey_tribbiani How ya doin'? Welcome. Good to see ya!
the_stage_manager This will be your phone.
joey_tribbiani That's great. But uh, I'm not really expecting a lot of calls.
the_stage_manager No you answer it and take pledges.
joey_tribbiani But I'm the host!
the_stage_manager No, Gary Collins is the host. You'll be answering the phones.
joey_tribbiani You don't seem to understand. See, I was Dr. Drake Remoray.
the_stage_manager Well, here's your phone doctor.
phoebe_buffay I cannot believe I can't find a selfless good deed! Y'know that old guy that lives next to me? Well, I snuck over there and-and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop. But he caught me and force-fed me cider and cookies. Then I felt wonderful. That old jackass!
rachel_green Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.
phoebe_buffay I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!
chandler_bing Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?
monica_geller Sure!
chandler_bing If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?
rachel_green Chandler! Is he?
monica_geller Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.
chandler_bing Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.
dr_ross_geller All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.
emily_waltham I understand that would be difficult.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?
emily_waltham I don't know, it's just
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh-okay, but-but I know, that even though I've been a-a complete idiot up 'til now, I mean, I mean you-you-you have to come here. You have to come here so we can work this out.
emily_waltham All right.
dr_ross_geller All right, did you just say all right?
emily_waltham I did. Now I'm the idiot.
dr_ross_geller Oh, Emily that is, that is so great. It's gonna be so great! We're gonna be like-like-like two idiots in love!
emily_waltham Ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.
dr_ross_geller Yes, tell me.
emily_waltham Well, you have to understand how humiliating it was for me up on that altar in front of my entire family, all my friends.
dr_ross_geller I know. I am, I am so sorry.
emily_waltham And then after decided to forgive you, seeing you at the airport catching our plane with her.
dr_ross_geller Again, very sorry.
emily_waltham I mean, I can't-I can't be in the same room as her! It drives me mad just thinking of you being in the same room as her!
dr_ross_geller Emily, there is nothing between Rachel and me. Okay? I love you.
emily_waltham All right. I'll come to New York and we'll try and make this work.
dr_ross_geller Oh that is so great! That's
emily_waltham As long as you don't see Rachel anymore.
dr_ross_geller So I asked Emily if she would come to New York, and she said yes.
chandler_bing Yes!
phoebe_buffay Ooh-ohh!
monica_geller Great!
dr_ross_geller No-no-no! Only if I promise never to see Rachel again.
phoebe_buffay Why?
monica_geller What?! You can't-what did you tell her?
dr_ross_geller I told her I'd have to think about it. I mean, how the hell am I supposed to make this kind of a decision? I'm actually asking you!
chandler_bing Well, you can't just not see Rachel anymore, she's one of your best friends.
monica_geller Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
chandler_bing That's true!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.
chandler_bing That's true!
monica_geller No, you cannot.
dr_ross_geller Thanks for the help, problem solved.
monica_geller Hello.
joey_tribbiani Hey Mon!
monica_geller Oh hey Joey! We've been watching all day, when are you gonna be on TV?
joey_tribbiani See, there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office, but I'm still on TV and that's good exposure.
monica_geller You're not on TV.
joey_tribbiani Oh, uh, okay, how, how about now?
chandler_bing Hey, there he is! There he is!
joey_tribbiani Hello New York!
emeril#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode04 Now maybe you just like wanna but the whole duck in there! Who cares, y'know? Now I got the legs
chandler_bing How many times have I told you guys, you never watch the cooking channel!
monica_geller Hi Chandler.
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Uh, listen, I need that broiling pan that Joey borrowed the other day.
chandler_bing Oh that was yours? Uh, yeah, we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.
monica_geller William Sonoma, fall catalog, Page 27.
chandler_bing Expect it in 4-6 weeks. Umm, hey, umm, Joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day, we have the whole place to ourselves.
monica_geller Yeah, so?
chandler_bing Well I just, thought maybe you'd wanna book some time with the best you'd ever had.
monica_geller Y'know what, champ? I think I'll pass.
chandler_bing Why?
monica_geller Why?
chandler_bing What's your point?
joey_tribbiani PBS telethon.
phoebe_buffay Hey Joey, I just wanted to let you know that I found a selfless good deed. I just went down to the park and I let a bee sting me.
joey_tribbiani What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?
phoebe_buffay Well, it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends. The bee is happy and I am definitely not.
joey_tribbiani Now, y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya.
phoebe_buffay Aw, dammit!
the_stage_manager Back on in 30 seconds people!
joey_tribbiani Hey, excuse me, would you mind switching with me?
the_pbs_volunteer Hey, no way, I'm in the shot man.
joey_tribbiani Come on man! You've been here all day!
the_pbs_volunteer Yeah, I-I'm taking pledges here, eh?
the_stage_manager We're on in 3, 2,
gary_collins Welcome back to our fall telethon. Now if you've been enjoying the performance of Cirque Du Soleil, and you'd like to see more of the same kind of programming, it's very simple. All you have to do is call in your pledge and at that time tell the operator, one of our volunteers, what kind of programming you'd like to
dr_ross_geller Okay, that's it. I cannot make this decision! It is too difficult, so I'm just gonna leave it entirely to the gods of fate.
monica_geller A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, it's not a toy.
dr_ross_geller Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!
monica_geller All right, let me see. Will Chandler have sex tonight? Don't count on it. Seems like it works to me.
joey_tribbiani PBS Telethon.
phoebe_buffay Hi Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay I would like to make a pledge. I would like to donate $200.
joey_tribbiani $200? Are you sure Pheebs? I mean, after what Sesame Street did to ya?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I'm still mad at them but I also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who's moms didn't kill themselves, so by supporting them, I'm doing a good thing, but I'm not happy about it. So there, a selfless good deed.
joey_tribbiani And you don't a little good about donating the money?
phoebe_buffay No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.
joey_tribbiani A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.
gary_collins It looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total! Thank you viewers! The pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers... Oh boy! And may I say one of our sharpest dressed volunteers, Mr. Joseph Tribbiani!
phoebe_buffay Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!
chandler_bing Look, maybe I got carried away before. But there's something you gotta know. If I'm the best, it's only because you've made me the best.
monica_geller Keep talking.
chandler_bing I mean I was nothing before you. Call the other girls and ask. Which wouldn't take long. But when I'm with you, and we're together, OH...MY...GOD.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Oh-aw my God! Now, I understand if you never want to sleep with me again, but that would be wrong. We're too good! We owe it, to sex!
monica_geller Well, if we owe it? Oh my... When is Joey gonna be home?
chandler_bing Well, I was kinda hoping we could do this without him. Oh no-no-no, leave the gloves on.
monica_geller But, I just cleaned the bathroom.
chandler_bing Yeah, why don't we lose the gloves.
monica_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing All right, let's show them how it's done.
monica_geller Okay.
monica_geller Ow!
chandler_bing Y'know that wasn't part of it?
monica_geller I know!
rachel_green Hi! Are you ready? We're gonna be late!
dr_ross_geller For what?
rachel_green For Stella! Remember? She's gettin' her grove back in like 20 minutes.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I uh, totally forgot about that. You mind if I take a rain check? I'm waiting for a call from Emily.
rachel_green Sure. I guess. Hey, I hear you don't have to go to London. Yay!
dr_ross_geller It's not that easy, there's still a lot of relationship stuff.
rachel_green Like what?
dr_ross_geller Just stuff. Y'know kinda what Emily wants.
rachel_green Well, why don't you talk to me about it, maybe I can help.
dr_ross_geller No. No. You-you can't help. I mean, I kinda have to do this without your help.
rachel_green Well, I-I know you can do that too. I'm just, I'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to... Hi!
dr_ross_geller Thanks.
rachel_green Ross? Look, whatever this relationship stuff that Emily wants, just give it to her. Come on, the bottom line here is that you love her. So just fix whatever she wants fixed. Just do it. I mean, you're gonna have to try. You'll just gonna hate yourself if you don't. Oh come on answer it! It's driving me crazy!
dr_ross_geller Hello. Hi sweetie. Good. Look umm, yes I've been thinking about that thing that you wanted me to do and, I can do it. So will you come to New York?
monica_geller Never done that before.
chandler_bing Nope.
