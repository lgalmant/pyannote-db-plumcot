chandler_bing Eh..., I don't, I don't know.
rachel_green What?
chandler_bing Well, as old as he is in dog years, do you think Snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing?
gunther Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah.
gunther Do you remember when you first came here, how you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?
rachel_green Oh, sure! Do you need me to train somebody new?
gunther Good one. Actually, ah, Terry wants you to take the training again, whenever.
rachel_green Eh, do you believe that?
chandler_bing Yeah?
sarah_tuttle So that's two boxes of the Holiday Macaroons. On behalf of the Brown Birds of America, I salute you.
dr_ross_geller Just admit it Chandler, you have no backhand.
chandler_bing Excuse me little one, I have a very solid backhand.
dr_ross_geller Shielding your face and shrieking like a girl... is not a backhand.
chandler_bing I was shrieking... like a Marine.
dr_ross_geller All right here. Watch me execute the three 'P's of championship play. Power. Precision. and penache.
monica_geller You broke a little girl's leg?!!
dr_ross_geller I know. I feel horrible. Okay.
chandler_bing Says here that a muppet got whacked on Seasame Street last night. Where exactly were around ten-ish?
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm gonna go see her. I want to bring her something, what do you think she'll like?
monica_geller Maybe a Hello Kitty doll, the ability to walk...
rachel_green I'm gonna get back to retraining.
dr_ross_geller All right, see you guys.
chandler_bing Look out kids, he's coming!
joey_tribbiani And I gotta go sell some Christmas trees.
phoebe_buffay Have fun. Oh wait, no, don't! I forgot I am totally against that now.
joey_tribbiani What? Me having a job?
phoebe_buffay No, no, I am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime, and their, their corpses grotesquely dressed in like tinsel and twinkly lights. Hey, how do you sleep at night?
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around all day. Hey, Phoebe listen, you got this all wrong. Those trees were born to be Christmas trees, their fulfilling their life purpose, by, by making people happy.
phoebe_buffay Really?
chandler_bing Yes. Yes, and ah, ah, the trees are happy too, because for most of them, it's the only chance to see New York.
gunther ..and after you've delivered the drinks, you take the empty tray....
rachel_green Gunther, Gunther, please, I've worked here for two and a half years, I know the empty trays go over there.
gunther What if you put them here.
rachel_green Huh. Well, y'know that's actually a really good idea, because that way they'll be closer to the mugs. Y'know what, you should have the other waitresses do that too.
gunther They already do. That's why they call it the 'tray spot.'
rachel_green Gee, I always heard them talk about that, I just always thought that it was a club they went to. Oh God, I'm, I'm sorry.
gunther It's all right. Sweetheart.
dr_ross_geller So, this must be kinda neat for ya, huh? I mean, your Dad tells me that you get a couple of days off school, and you, you ah, don't have to sell those cookies anymore.
sarah_tuttle Well, I kinda wanted to sell the cookies. The girl who sells the most wins a trip to Spacecamp, and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
dr_ross_geller Wow, you ah, you really like all this space stuff, huh?
sarah_tuttle Yeah. My Dad says if I spend as much time helping him clean apartments, as I do daydreaming about outer space, he'd be able to afford a trip to the Taj Mahal.
dr_ross_geller I think you would have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to India.
sarah_tuttle No. The one in Atlantic City, Dad loves the slots. He says he's gonna double the college money my Grandma left me.
dr_ross_geller Huh. Well, good luck to Dad. Say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?
sarah_tuttle The girl who won last year sold four hundred and seventy-five.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
sarah_tuttle So far, I've sold seventy-five.
dr_ross_geller Four hundred, huh? Well, that sounds do-able. How much are the boxes?
sarah_tuttle Five dollars a box.
dr_ross_geller And what is second prize?
sarah_tuttle A ten speed bike. But, I'd rather have something my Dad couldn't sell.
dr_ross_geller Well, that makes sense.
sarah_tuttle Could you do me one favor, if it's not too much trouble?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, Sarah, anything.
sarah_tuttle Could you pull open the curtains for me? The astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news, and since we don't have a TV, the lady across the alley said she'd push hers up to a window, so I could watch it.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 Yesss?
dr_ross_geller Hi, I'm selling Brown Bird cookies.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 You're no Brown Bird, I can see you through my peephole.
dr_ross_geller No, hi, I'm, I'm an honorary Brown Bird
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 What does that mean?
dr_ross_geller Ah, well, it means that I can sell cookies, but I'm not invited to sleep-overs.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 I can dial 9-1-1 at the touch of a button, y'know. Now, go away!
dr_ross_geller No, please, please, um, it's for a poor little girl who wants to go to Spacecamp more than anything in the world.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 I'm pressing, a policeman is on his way.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay! I'm going. I'm going.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 I can still see you!
dr_ross_geller All right!!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey. What, what are you doing here?
phoebe_buffay Well, I-I thought a lot about what you said, and um, I realilized duh, all right maybe I was a little judgmental. Yeah, oh, but oh...
joey_tribbiani Look now, Phoebe remember, hey, their just fulfilling their Christmas....
phoebe_buffay Destiny.
joey_tribbiani Sure.
phoebe_buffay Yes.
joey_tribbiani All right.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Yikes! That one doesn't look very fulfilled.
joey_tribbiani Oh, that's, that's ah, one of the old ones, he's just taking it to the back.
phoebe_buffay You keep the old ones in the back, that is so ageist.
joey_tribbiani Well we have to make room for the fresh ones.
phoebe_buffay So, what happens to the old guys?
joey_tribbiani Well, they go into the chipper.
phoebe_buffay Why, do I have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds? No! Nooooo!!!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Hey!!
dr_ross_geller ..and these come in the shapes of your favourite Christmas characters, Santa, Rudolph, and Baby Jesus.
joey_tribbiani All right, I'll take a box of the cream filled Jesus's.
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, one box! Come on, I'm trying to send a little girl to Spacecamp, I'm putting you down for five boxes. Chandler, what about you?
chandler_bing Ahh, do you have any coconut flavoured deities?
dr_ross_geller No, but ah, there's coconut in the Hanukkah Menoreoes. I tell you what, I'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.
dr_ross_geller Mon?
monica_geller All right, I'll take one box of the mint treasures, just one, and that's it. I-I started gaining weight after I joined the Brown Birds. Remember, how Dad bought all my boxes and I ate them all?
dr_ross_geller Ah, no Mon, Dad had to buy everyone of your boxes because you ate them all. But ah, y'know I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time, why don't I put you down for three of the mint treasures and just a couple of the Rudolph's.
monica_geller No.
dr_ross_geller Oh, come on, now you know you want 'em.
monica_geller Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do this.
dr_ross_geller I'll tell you what Mon, I'll give you the first box for free.
monica_geller Oh God! I gotta go!
dr_ross_geller Come on! All the cool kids are eating 'em!
gunther And when you have a second later, I wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders under coffee mugs and leave them there.
rachel_green I'm training to be better at a job that I hate, my life officially sucks.
joey_tribbiani Look Rach, wasn't this supposed to a temporary thing? I thought you wanted to do fashion stuff?
rachel_green Well, yeah! I'm still pursuing that.
chandler_bing How... exactly are you pursuing that? Y'know other than sending out resumes like what, two years ago?
rachel_green Well, I'm also sending out.... good thoughts.
joey_tribbiani If you ask me, as long as you got this job, you've got nothing pushing you to get another one. You need the fear.
rachel_green The fear?
chandler_bing He's right, if you quit this job, you then have motivation to go after a job you really want.
rachel_green Well then how come you're still at a job that you hate, I mean why don't you quit and get 'the fear'?
chandler_bing Because, I'm too afraid.
rachel_green I don't know, I mean I would give anything to work for a designer, y'know, or a buyer.... Oh, I just don't want to be 30 and still work here.
chandler_bing Yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28, and still working here.
gunther Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah.
gunther Remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.
rachel_green Can't I just look at the handles on them?
gunther You would think.
rachel_green Okay, fine. Gunther, y'know what, I am a terrible waitress, do you know why I'm a terrible waitress? Because, I don't care. I don't care. I don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don't care where the tray spot is, I just don't care, this is not what I want to do. So I don't think I should do it anymore. I'm gonna give you my weeks notice.
gunther What?!
rachel_green Gunther, I quit.
chandler_bing Does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?
dr_ross_geller ...and 12, 22, 18, four... What?
chandler_bing I spelled out boobies.
monica_geller Ross, but me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay. Where, where are the mint treasures?
dr_ross_geller Ah, we're out. I sold them all.
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller Monica, I'm cutting you off.
monica_geller No. No, just, just, just a couple more boxes. It-it-it's no big deal, all right, I'm-I'm cool. You gotta help me out with a couple more boxes!
dr_ross_geller Mon, look at yourself. You have cookie on your neck.
monica_geller Oh God!
chandler_bing So, how many have you sold so far?
dr_ross_geller Check this out. Five hundred and seventeen boxes!
chandler_bing Oh my God, how did you do that?
dr_ross_geller Okay, the other night I was leaving the museum just as 'Laser Floyd' was letting out of the planetarium, without even trying I sold 50 boxes! That's when it occurred to me, the key to my success, 'the munchies.' So I ah, started hitting the NYU dorms around midnight. I am selling cookies by the case. They call me: 'Cookie Dude!'
rachel_green Okay, stop what you're doing, I need envelope stuffers, I need stamp lickers.....
dr_ross_geller Well hey, who did these resumes for ya?
chandler_bing Me! On my computer.
dr_ross_geller Well you sure used a large font.
chandler_bing Eh, yeah, well ah, waitress at a coffee shop and cheer squad co-captain only took up so much room.
rachel_green Hey-hey-hey that's funny! Your funny Chandler! Your a funny guy! You wanna know what else is really funny?!
chandler_bing Something else I might have said?
rachel_green I don't know, I don't know, weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job when I had absolutely nothing else to do. Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!!
dr_ross_geller Sweetie, calm down, it's gonna be okay.
rachel_green No, it's not gonna be okay Ross, tomorrow is my last day, and I don't have a lead. Okay, y'know what, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna call Gunther and I'm gonna tell him, I'm not quitting.
chandler_bing You-you-you don't wanna give into the fear.
rachel_green You and your stupid fear. I hate your fear. I would like to take you and your fear....
joey_tribbiani Hey! I got great news!
chandler_bing Run, Joey! Run for your life!
joey_tribbiani What? Rachel, listen, have you ever heard of Fortunata Fashions?
rachel_green No.
joey_tribbiani Well my old man is doing a plumbing job down there and he heard they have an opening. So, you want me to see if I can get you an interview?
rachel_green Oh my God! Yes, I would love that, oh, that is soo sweet, Joey.
joey_tribbiani Not a problem.
rachel_green Thanks.
joey_tribbiani And now for the great news.
dr_ross_geller What, that wasn't the great news?
joey_tribbiani Only if you think it's better than this... snow-in-a-can!! I got it at work. Mon, you want me to decorate the window, give it a kind of Christmas lookie.
monica_geller Christmas cookie?
joey_tribbiani Okay, and ah, this one here is a Douglas Fir, now it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.

phoebe_buffay Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, you don't want that one. No, you can have this cool brown one.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 It's-it's-it's almost dead!
phoebe_buffay Okay but that's why you have to buy it, so it can fulfil it's Christmas destiny, otherwise there gonna throw it into the chipper. Tell him, Joey
joey_tribbiani Yeah, the ah, trees that don't fulfil their Christmas destiny are thrown in the chipper.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 I-I think I'm gonna look around a little bit more.
joey_tribbiani Pheebs, you gotta stop this, I working on commission here.
monica_geller Hey, guys. I'm here to pick out my Christmas tree.
phoebe_buffay Well look no further, this one's yours! Ahhh.
monica_geller Is this the one that I threw out last year?
phoebe_buffay All right y'know what, nevermind! Everyone wants to have a green one! I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get so emotional, I guess it's just the holidays, it's hard.
monica_geller Oh honey, is that 'cause your Mom died around Christmas?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that.
monica_geller Oh.
dr_ross_geller Hi there. How many, how many ah, did you sell?
girl#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 I'm not gonna tell you! You're the bad man who broke Sarah's leg.
dr_ross_geller Hey now! That was an accident, okay.
girl#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 You're a big scrud.
dr_ross_geller What's a scrud?
girl#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 Why don't you look in the mirror, scrud.
dr_ross_geller I don't have too. I can just look at you.
troop_leader All right girls, and man. Let's see your final tallies. Ohhhh, Debbie, 321 boxes of cookies, Very nice.
dr_ross_geller Not nice enough.

troop_leader Oh, yes Elizabeth. Ah, 871.
dr_ross_geller That's crap!! Sister Brown Bird. Good going.
troop_leader Who's next?
dr_ross_geller Hi there!
troop_leader Hi. And batting for Sarah, Ross Geller, 872. Although, it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.
dr_ross_geller Um, that is because my doctor says that I have a very serious.... nuget.... diffency.
chandler_bing Tell us what happened, Brown Bird Ross.
dr_ross_geller Well, I lost. Some little girl loaned her uniform to her nineteen year old sister, who went down to the U.S.S. Nimitz, and sold over 2,000 boxes.
chandler_bing Hey! How'd the interview go?
rachel_green Oh, I blew it. I wouldn't of even hired me.
dr_ross_geller Oh, come here sweetie, listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job. That's not how that was supposed to come out.
phoebe_buffay This is the worst Christmas ever.
chandler_bing Y'know what Rach, maybe you should just, y'know stay here at the coffee house.
rachel_green I can't! It's too late! Terry already hired that girl over there. Look at her, she's even got waitress experience. Last night she was teaching everybody how to make napkin.... swans.
dr_ross_geller That word was swans.
chandler_bing Well seeing that drunk Santa wet himself, really perked up my Christmas.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Oh my God!
joey_tribbiani@monica_geller Merry Christmas!!
phoebe_buffay You saved them! You guys! Oh God, you're the best!

chandler_bing Should I tell her I ordered tea?
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green Um, excuse me, everyone. Ah, this is my last night working here, and I ah, just wanted say that I made some really good friends working here, and ah, it's just time to move on. Ah, and no offence to everybody who ah, still works here, you have no idea how good it feels to say that as of this moment I will never have to make coffee again.
rachels_boss#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode10 Now Mr. Kaplan Sr. likes his coffee strong, so your gonna use two bags instead of one, see. Now pay attention, 'cause this part's tricky, see some people use filters just once.
dr_ross_geller I'm, I'm sorry you didn't get to go to Spacecamp, and I'm hoping that maybe somehow, this may make up for it. Presenting Sarah Tuttle's Private Very Special Spacecamp!!
sarah_tuttle Really Mr. Geller, you don't have to do this.
