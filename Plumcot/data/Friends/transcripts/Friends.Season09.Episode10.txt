phoebe_buffay ..sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!"
joey_tribbiani Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?
phoebe_buffay Uh-huh.
chandler_bing Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.
monica_geller I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.
dr_ross_geller You're really not coming back?
chandler_bing Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
monica_geller It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!
chandler_bing So, who does?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I like my job.
joey_tribbiani I 'love' my job.
rachel_green Yeah, I can't 'wait' to go back to work.
dr_ross_geller I can't get 'enough' dinosaurs!
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I won't be here.
monica_geller It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.
chandler_bing Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.
monica_geller You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??
chandler_bing Did I not mention that?
monica_geller No!
chandler_bing AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!
chandler_bing All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's 'no' call for writing "Screw you, Mr. Bing!" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.
wendy Hey!
others#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode10 Hey.
chandler_bing Hey. Where've you been?
wendy I was, uh, checking out that insurance company's Christmas party on three, oh, it was really beautiful, they have all these decorations and this huge tree and I just, uh... to hell with them, we have to work. -- So I stole ther ham.
chandler_bing You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.
claudia My kid's in a play right now.
chandler_bing Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.
ken "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet".
chandler_bing Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!
wendy 'Now' it feels like Christmas.
chandler_bing I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.
ken You can come to my house!
chandler_bing Haha, no thanks!
wendy That was a nice pep-talk.
chandler_bing Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.
wendy So, if you were home right now, what would you be doing?
chandler_bing Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...
phoebe_buffay So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me.
rachel_green Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.
chandler_bing I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.
rachel_green We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
chandler_bing What? That's terrible!
phoebe_buffay No-no, we do it every year!
chandler_bing Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.
phoebe_buffay No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.
rachel_green Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?
chandler_bing No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!
phoebe_buffay Oh no, we have to!
chandler_bing No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.
phoebe_buffay Well then, you should look with us.
chandler_bing Why?
rachel_green Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?
chandler_bing No, I have a great idea for a present for her.
phoebe_buffay Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah.
rachel_green Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?
chandler_bing If I help, we can find 'em faster!
rachel_green That's right!
phoebe_buffay Ooh ooh, we have a live one!
rachel_green Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
rachel_green Oh.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, who's it for?
rachel_green "Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you."
joey_tribbiani Rach, these are for you.
rachel_green Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
joey_tribbiani No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.
chandler_bing OK, Pheebs, your turn.
phoebe_buffay Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?
joey_tribbiani Uh-huh.
phoebe_buffay You guuuyys.
joey_tribbiani And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.
dr_ross_geller You got me a cola drink?
chandler_bing And, a lemon lime.
dr_ross_geller Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.
chandler_bing And last but not least.
joey_tribbiani They're ribbed for 'your' pleasure.
dr_ross_geller Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?
ben_geller Cool!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
monica_geller Come on Ben.
dr_ross_geller Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...
chandler_bing Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!
ben_geller Santa!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller What are you doing here, Santa?
chandler_bing Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?
dr_ross_geller I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.
dr_ross_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!
dr_ross_geller Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.
chandler_bing Why?
dr_ross_geller Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.
chandler_bing But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.
chandler_bing Fine, I'll give the suit back.
monica_geller Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?
chandler_bing Santa? Really?
monica_geller Yeah, is that okay?
chandler_bing Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?
monica_geller No.
chandler_bing Then it's okaaay!
chandler_bing You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.
chandler_bing Did I not tell 'anyone' about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.
chandler_bing Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?
wendy Naah... I couldn't leave you alone.
chandler_bing Ah. Thanks.
wendy Besides, I can't leave until their Christmas party downstairs clears out; there are some 'pissed off' insurance people looking for that ham.
chandler_bing Ah. Chandler Bing.
monica_geller Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
others#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode10 Merry Christmas!
phoebe_buffay Ble-blah-blar Blargh!
chandler_bing Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!
monica_geller So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?
chandler_bing Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.
monica_geller Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.
chandler_bing It is. Did I... not tell you about her?
monica_geller Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?
chandler_bing I sent them home.
monica_geller Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?
chandler_bing Uhh, uh...
dr_ross_geller Answer faster, answer faster!
chandler_bing I don't know!
dr_ross_geller Answer better, answer better!
chandler_bing I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.
monica_geller What does she do there?
chandler_bing Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.
monica_geller She did WHAT?
chandler_bing BE-LOW me!
joey_tribbiani Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?
monica_geller 'What'??
chandler_bing Well, she... she didn't win...
monica_geller Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.
chandler_bing Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of 'all' the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...
rachel_green Oh Chandler, stop talking!
chandler_bing Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.
monica_geller Okay.
chandler_bing I'm serious!
monica_geller Okay!
chandler_bing Merry Christmas.
monica_geller Merry Christmas.
chandler_bing Merry Christmas, you guys!
others#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode10 Yeah, Merry... Christmas.
phoebe_buffay Blah blargah, blar-blab.
chandler_bing The wife says "Hi!".
wendy Ah. Fun conversation?
chandler_bing Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.
wendy Huh? Really? -- Hm, that'd be so terrible?
chandler_bing This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.
chandler_bing Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!
wendy ..Missy?
chandler_bing I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me!.. Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?
wendy You are to me...
chandler_bing No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!
wendy So? I'm married.
chandler_bing I'm 'happily' married.
wendy Oh. - What's 'that' like?
chandler_bing Right. So, I'm sorry...
wendy Seriously? Happily married. So that phone call before, that was.. happy?
chandler_bing Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money!.. You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now,..she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.
wendy Okay, let me ask you something: if what you and your wife have is so great, then why are you spending Christmas with me?
chandler_bing I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?
monica_geller Well, not anymore.
chandler_bing But we don't do that.
monica_geller I know, I just thought it would be fun.
chandler_bing How drunk are you?
monica_geller Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.
chandler_bing That's the perfect amount!
monica_geller Okay!
monica_geller Y'know what's weird?
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller This doesn't feel weird!
chandler_bing I know.
monica_geller You're a really good kisser.
chandler_bing Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?
monica_geller Hm-hmm!
chandler_bing Okay!
monica_geller Wow! You are really fast!
chandler_bing It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.
monica_geller We're gonna see each other naked.
chandler_bing Yep!
monica_geller Do you wanna do it at the same time?
chandler_bing Count of three?
monica_geller One!
chandler_bing Two!
monica_geller Two!
both#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode10 Three!
chandler_bing Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.
monica_geller Eh, we weren't that close anyway!
chandler_bing Eh!
chandler_bing So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?
monica_geller Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.
chandler_bing Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am 'so' bad at this.
monica_geller I think you're better than you think you are.
chandler_bing Really? Okay, so...
monica_geller Know when to stop.
chandler_bing Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?
monica_geller Yeah. Don't do the dance.
chandler_bing Right!
monica_geller I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.
chandler_bing Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.
monica_geller You're so efficient. I love you!
chandler_bing Let's go!
monica_geller No-no-no, wait! We need something old!
chandler_bing Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.
monica_geller That'll work!
chandler_bing I don't think so.
monica_geller Okay, now we just need something borrowed!
chandler_bing Here just...take this.
monica_geller That's stealing!
chandler_bing No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.
monica_geller Ohh.
chandler_bing Okay, one thing at a time.
monica_geller Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.
chandler_bing Ehh.
monica_geller Eh, you work for that.
chandler_bing Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.
monica_geller You do?!
chandler_bing Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.
monica_geller Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?
chandler_bing Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.
monica_geller You thought about that?
chandler_bing Yeah.
monica_geller How many kids were we gonna have?
chandler_bing Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.
monica_geller What else did you think about?
chandler_bing Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.
monica_geller Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
chandler_bing Sure you do.
monica_geller No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.
chandler_bing You sure?
monica_geller Uh-hmm.
chandler_bing I love you so much.
monica_geller I love you.
rachel_green Oohh, I love it!
dr_ross_geller Really? You're not gonna return it?
rachel_green Well, not this second!
phoebe_buffay Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!
rachel_green Oh wow, it's so beautiful...
dr_ross_geller Wow, it really is!
monica_geller "Wendy" is a fat girl name.
phoebe_buffay Aren't we done with that?
monica_geller Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Oh my god...
joey_tribbiani Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!
monica_geller What are you doing here?
chandler_bing I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?
chandler_bing Monica.
joey_tribbiani Got ya.
chandler_bing I never want to leave you again!
monica_geller But I thought if you left, you get fired.
chandler_bing Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller What, you, you really quit your job?
chandler_bing Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he 'really' wants to do?
rachel_green What do you really want to do?
chandler_bing I have 'not' thought this through!
monica_geller Oh my god!
chandler_bing I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.
monica_geller No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!
chandler_bing Thanks!
phoebe_buffay Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.
chandler_bing Ahh...
phoebe_buffay Now give me my real gift.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
chandler_bing Here, pass these, will ya..
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey...
dr_ross_geller "A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet." -- How did you know?
rachel_green Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.
chandler_bing I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.
joey_tribbiani Mine's is to Lilian Myers.
chandler_bing I don't have a 'job'!
chandler_bing Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. 'You' are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!
monica_geller You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?
