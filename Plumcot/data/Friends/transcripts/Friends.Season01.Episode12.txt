chandler_bing No-no-no-no, we're done.
monica_geller Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
joey_tribbiani Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
dr_ross_geller Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
phoebe_buffay Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
chandler_bing And, we're done with the yogurt.
phoebe_buffay Sorry.
monica_geller Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy!
dr_ross_geller Hello!
joey_tribbiani How come you don't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian?
rachel_green Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
paolo Ah, poke a nose, mmm
jasmine Mma, Mma, Mmaah
monica_geller So, did I hear Poconos?
rachel_green Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
phoebe_buffay Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
monica_geller Yeah, that's a big step.
rachel_green I know...
chandler_bing Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
dr_ross_geller Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
rachel_green I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
dr_ross_geller ..nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration!
joey_tribbiani I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
chandler_bing Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
joey_tribbiani Need a new table.
chandler_bing You think?
carol_willick Hey hey, come on in!
dr_ross_geller Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
carol_willick Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.
dr_ross_geller I'm pretty sure that it is...
carol_willick So, I got the results of the amnio today.
dr_ross_geller Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
carol_willick Totally and completely healthy!
dr_ross_geller Oh, that's great, that is great!
dr_ross_geller Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
carol_willick Uh, that's our friend Tanya.
dr_ross_geller Of course it's your friend Tanya.
carol_willick Don't you want to know about the sex?
dr_ross_geller The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw...
carol_willick The sex of the baby, Ross.
dr_ross_geller Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
carol_willick Do you want to know?
dr_ross_geller No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or isn't...
susan_bunch Oh, hello Ross!
dr_ross_geller Susan...
susan_bunch So, so, did you hear?
dr_ross_geller Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
susan_bunch Oh, that's so... It really is...do we know...?
carol_willick Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
susan_bunch Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?
carol_willick Mm-hmmm
dr_ross_geller Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
carol_willick@susan_bunch It's a...
dr_ross_geller No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
carol_willick Well, thanks for the books.
dr_ross_geller No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan...
susan_bunch All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona?
carol_willick Hello?
dr_ross_geller Uh, never mind, I don't want to know.
chandler_bing Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
joey_tribbiani That's the rule.
chandler_bing What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
joey_tribbiani How'd you get to that?
chandler_bing Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
joey_tribbiani You knew about that?
chandler_bing Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
joey_tribbiani Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
chandler_bing What do you mean, like, buy it together?
joey_tribbiani Yeah
chandler_bing You think we're ready for something like that?
joey_tribbiani Why not?
chandler_bing Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
joey_tribbiani Why, are you moving out?
chandler_bing I'm not moving out.
joey_tribbiani You'd tell me if you were moving out right
chandler_bing Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
joey_tribbiani Aw, I know all about Kip!
chandler_bing It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
joey_tribbiani Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
chandler_bing Aw, don't do that
phoebes_assistant#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode12 We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
phoebe_buffay Ok, thanks.
phoebes_assistant#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode12 Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum
paolo Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
paolo Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?
phoebe_buffay Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
paolo Uh, I am, uh, being naked?
phoebe_buffay Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
rachel_green I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
monica_geller And Monica knows...
dr_ross_geller Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
monica_geller Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
joey_tribbiani So what's it gonna be?
dr_ross_geller Wait-oh-hey-huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
monica_geller I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
joey_tribbiani Or an uncle...
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey Phoebe!
dr_ross_geller Hi Pheebs!
rachel_green Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Fine!
monica_geller Phoebe, what's the matter?
phoebe_buffay Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
customer Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?
rachel_green Oh, right, that's me!
joey_tribbiani Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
chandler_bing Fine.
monica_geller Phoebe, what is it?
phoebe_buffay All right, you know Paolo?
dr_ross_geller I'm familiar with his work, yes...
phoebe_buffay Well, he made a move on me.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
chandler_bing More coffee over here, please!
monica_geller Well, what happened?
phoebe_buffay Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Ooooohh!
dr_ross_geller My God.
monica_geller Are you sure?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore.
monica_geller Was it...?
phoebe_buffay Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
guys#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode12 Oooooo....
rachel_green "Ooo," what?
phoebe_buffay Uma Thurman.
monica_geller Oh!
dr_ross_geller The actress!
dr_ross_geller Thanks Rach.
chandler_bing So what are you gonna do?
dr_ross_geller You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys?
chandler_bing Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
joey_tribbiani Feminist issue. That's where I went!
phoebe_buffay She is gonna hate me.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well...
joey_tribbiani Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one?
chandler_bing That's patio furniture!
joey_tribbiani So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!
chandler_bing What about the birds?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."
chandler_bing You pick one.
joey_tribbiani All right, how about the ladybugs?
chandler_bing Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
joey_tribbiani Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
chandler_bing Not like that, I won't! Kip would have liked the birds!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
rachel_green Hi Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Are you moving out?
rachel_green No, these aren't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's.
phoebe_buffay Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
rachel_green Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
phoebe_buffay Oh! Ok, um, ok, um,
rachel_green Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
phoebe_buffay Ok, um, we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.
rachel_green Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
rachel_green All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
phoebe_buffay Which proves that I never lie.
rachel_green I guess you don't.
phoebe_buffay Paolo made a pass at me.
chandler_bing So, what do you think?
dr_ross_geller I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
chandler_bing I know!
monica_geller So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
joey_tribbiani Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
monica_geller Heads up Ross! Score! You suck!
phoebe_buffay Are you okay?
rachel_green I need some milk.
phoebe_buffay Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better?
rachel_green No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
phoebe_buffay I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
rachel_green Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
phoebe_buffay No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
rachel_green I don't know...right, he's the pig!
phoebe_buffay Such a pig!
rachel_green Oh, God, he's such a pig,
phoebe_buffay Oh he's like a...
rachel_green He's like a big disgusting...
phoebe_buffay ..like a...
rachel_green ..pig...pig man!
phoebe_buffay Yes, good! Ok...
rachel_green Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
phoebe_buffay Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
rachel_green Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
phoebe_buffay The end.
rachel_green Oh, God...
phoebe_buffay Should I not have told you?
rachel_green No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
phoebe_buffay I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
monica_geller We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one...second! Score! Game! Come on.
dr_ross_geller Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
joey_tribbiani No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
dr_ross_geller Come on, two on one.
chandler_bing What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
dr_ross_geller What, now?
joey_tribbiani Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
chandler_bing My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross!
paolo No, that's cold, that's cold, that's...
dr_ross_geller How's it going?
monica_geller Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!
phoebe_buffay Ooh!
paolo Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok bye-bye.
monica_geller Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
paolo Grazie.
dr_ross_geller Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say...
phoebe_buffay Oh, just look at her...
dr_ross_geller Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
monica_geller Oh, you're right.
dr_ross_geller ..and I really think it should be me.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller You all right?
rachel_green Ooh, I've been better...
dr_ross_geller Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
rachel_green Oh, Ross...
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy.
dr_ross_geller Huh.
rachel_green Oh Ross, you're so great!
dr_ross_geller Ohhhh
monica_geller Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
rachel_green Oh...
phoebe_buffay You ok?
rachel_green ..medium...hmm...any cookies left?
phoebe_buffay Yep!
dr_ross_geller See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
rachel_green No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
dr_ross_geller Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
rachel_green No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
rachel_green Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
dr_ross_geller Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy?
girls#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode12 Yes, you're having a boy!
dr_ross_geller I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
chandler_bing Wha-
joey_tribbiani Wha-
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani What is it?
dr_ross_geller I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani We already knew that!
dr_ross_geller I'm having a son. Um...
monica_geller Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Shut-out!!
monica_geller Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
joey_tribbiani Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
chandler_bing Yeah, get out!
monica_geller You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, and I'm gone.
chandler_bing One more game?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah!
