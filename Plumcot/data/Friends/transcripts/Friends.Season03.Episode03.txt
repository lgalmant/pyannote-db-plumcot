joey_tribbiani WHOAA!!
chandler_bing See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.
monica_geller Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning.
dr_ross_geller Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
monica_geller Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
rachel_green I didn't know there were docks.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller Aww, is it broken?
joey_tribbiani No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.
rachel_green Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
joey_tribbiani Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
chandler_bing Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just 'fell' out of the socket.
joey_tribbiani What is this? Fruit?
rachel_green Monica's making jam.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, jam! I love jam! Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?
chandler_bing Because the kids need new shoes.
monica_geller I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam. Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot.
joey_tribbiani This will just be my batch.
phoebe_buffay Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters....
phoebe_buffay What?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 One more chance Ursula, please?
phoebe_buffay Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Wh..
phoebe_buffay Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!
phoebe_buffay Oh, you're not a dingus.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones.
phoebe_buffay Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Well thanks.
phoebe_buffay Wait, you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Not really.
phoebe_buffay Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here
phoebe_buffay Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Yeah, okay.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode03 Sorry.
rachel_green Mon?
dr_ross_geller Mon?
rachel_green 'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
dr_ross_geller Wait a minute, look.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller Look, look, look.
rachel_green What, what, what?
dr_ross_geller It's an empty apartment.
rachel_green Oooh.
dr_ross_geller We're all alone in an empty apartment.
rachel_green Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything.
dr_ross_geller There it is.
rachel_green Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about. Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey.
chandler_bing Do I look fat?
dr_ross_geller@rachel_green Noo.
chandler_bing Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow.
rachel_green Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it.
chandler_bing Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her....
dr_ross_geller Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?
rachel_green Nooo!
dr_ross_geller And it works both ways.
chandler_bing Okay, so you both just know this stuff?
rachel_green Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on.
dr_ross_geller Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?
chandler_bing That's easy, baggage claim.
dr_ross_geller Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her.
chandler_bing Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something.
rachel_green Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers. Okay, I'm late for work.
dr_ross_geller Oh.
rachel_green All right are you guys gonna come down?
dr_ross_geller Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you.
rachel_green Good luck Chandler.
chandler_bing Thank you Rachel.
dr_ross_geller Bye sweetie.
rachel_green Bye hon.
dr_ross_geller Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do.
chandler_bing Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers.
dr_ross_geller Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here. Okay, you're in bed...
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna use the cushion.
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you.
chandler_bing Okay, the old hug and roll.
dr_ross_geller Yep.
chandler_bing Okay, one question.
dr_ross_geller Shoot.
chandler_bing You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
joey_tribbiani Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
rachel_green You're so pretty.
phoebe_buffay Hi!
all@ Hey, Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today.
joey_tribbiani You talked to him. Are you crazy?
phoebe_buffay Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order.
chandler_bing Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom.
phoebe_buffay Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.
phoebe_buffay No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her.
joey_tribbiani Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean
phoebe_buffay Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather.
monica_geller Hey guys.
all@ Hey Mon.
monica_geller Joey, this is for you. It's blackberry curin.
joey_tribbiani Aww. Ohh!
chandler_bing Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam.
joey_tribbiani Put your hands together.
monica_geller Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch.
joey_tribbiani No more jam?!
rachel_green Well, what happened to your jam plan?
monica_geller I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies.
chandler_bing Well, your gonna need much bigger jars.
dr_ross_geller What are you talking about?
monica_geller I'm talking about me having a baby.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Are you serious?
monica_geller Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan.
dr_ross_geller Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!
monica_geller It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid.
chandler_bing That, that's what's stupid.
monica_geller I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff.
rachel_green Down at the docks again?
janice Night-night Bing-a-ling.
chandler_bing Night-night.....Janice. 'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom! Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!'
malcolm Here's my binoculars.
phoebe_buffay Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going.
malcolm These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun.
phoebe_buffay Oh, yeah. What's this?
malcolm Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?
phoebe_buffay Um, not even a little bit.
malcolm It's about you.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay then.
malcolm I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool.
phoebe_buffay Good. So what were you thinking?
malcolm I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
phoebe_buffay Really?
malcolm No.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
malcolm See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you.
phoebe_buffay Oh, okay.
chandler_bing No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard.
monica_geller Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis.
chandler_bing You mean there's more than one of us.
dr_ross_geller Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna.....
monica_geller You're gonna what?
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna tell Mom.
rachel_green Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy.
dr_ross_geller Crazy.
monica_geller What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
dr_ross_geller Oh, it's not the ideal way...
monica_geller Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?
joey_tribbiani Check it out!! Jam crackers!
monica_geller Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy. Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'
joey_tribbiani Yeah, the Knicks rule!
monica_geller Joey, this is you!
joey_tribbiani Let me see. Oh, right.
rachel_green When did you go to a sperm bank?
joey_tribbiani Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU. Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?
chandler_bing And that's how you bought it?
joey_tribbiani Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left.
monica_geller Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here.
joey_tribbiani Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little.
phoebe_buffay Hellooo!
all@ Hey.
dr_ross_geller How's the maniac?
phoebe_buffay Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'.
rachel_green Phoebe, what are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me.
rachel_green Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that.
phoebe_buffay Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything.
dr_ross_geller You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
phoebe_buffay What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?
chandler_bing Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.
phoebe_buffay What are you saying I should do?
monica_geller I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.
phoebe_buffay Thank you, Monica.
joey_tribbiani Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes.
monica_geller Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine.
rachel_green Oh my God, what happened?
janice Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!
rachel_green Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
janice Oh, I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing.
rachel_green Ross's what?
janice You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God.
malcolm Phoebe?
phoebe_buffay Yes? Yes! Oh.
malcolm What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh.
malcolm Were you following me?
phoebe_buffay Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.
malcolm So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me.
phoebe_buffay Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?
malcolm I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic.
phoebe_buffay No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch.
