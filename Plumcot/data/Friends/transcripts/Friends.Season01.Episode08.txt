chandler_bing Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
shelly Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.
chandler_bing Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
shelly Do you want a date Saturday?
chandler_bing Yes please.
shelly Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-
chandler_bing He's a he?
shelly Well yeah!..Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...
chandler_bing ..Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
rachel_green Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
chandler_bing You did?
rachel_green Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
chandler_bing Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
monica_geller I did.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I think so, yeah.
joey_tribbiani Not me.
dr_ross_geller Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
chandler_bing You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
dr_ross_geller No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
chandler_bing Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
phoebe_buffay I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
chandler_bing Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
all@ Yeah! Right!
chandler_bing WHAT IS IT?!
monica_geller Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
all@ Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
chandler_bing Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
monica_geller Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
rachel_green Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio.
dr_ross_geller So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
rachel_green Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome.
monica_geller Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
dr_ross_geller So, uh, how's she doing?
aunt_lillian The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
monica_geller How-how are you, Mom?
judy_geller Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here...What's with your hair?
monica_geller What?
judy_geller What's different?
monica_geller Nothing.
judy_geller Oh, maybe that's it.
monica_geller She is unbelievable, our mother is...
dr_ross_geller Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
monica_geller Oh God!
monica_geller The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
dr_ross_geller Oh!..Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
jack_geller Not just restaurants, from our house.
nanas_nurse Mrs. Geller?
dr_ross_geller She looks so small.
monica_geller I know.
dr_ross_geller Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
monica_geller G'bye, Nana.
dr_ross_geller Bye, Nana.
monica_geller Ross!
judy_geller What is going on?!
dr_ross_geller Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
judy_geller What?
dr_ross_geller She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
aunt_lillian What's going on?
jack_geller She may have died.
aunt_lillian She may have died?
jack_geller We're looking into it.
dr_ross_geller I, uh, I'll go see.
nanas_nurse This almost never happens!
dr_ross_geller Now she's passed.
chandler_bing I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
rachel_green Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
rachel_green So, um, did she...
dr_ross_geller Twice.
joey_tribbiani Twice?
phoebe_buffay Oh, that sucks!
joey_tribbiani You guys okay?
dr_ross_geller I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
phoebe_buffay Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
dr_ross_geller Nono, she's gone.
monica_geller We checked. A lot.
phoebe_buffay Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?..I miss her.
rachel_green Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this?
phoebe_buffay Thanks!
rachel_green Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
joey_tribbiani Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!.So Chandler looks gay, huh?
phoebe_buffay Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie.
dr_ross_geller I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
judy_geller Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!
judy_geller Sweetie, you think you can get in there?
dr_ross_geller I don't see why not.
dr_ross_geller Here's my retainer!
jack_geller I was just thinking. When my time comes-
monica_geller Dad!
jack_geller Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea.
monica_geller You what?
jack_geller I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun.
monica_geller Define fun.
jack_geller C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...
monica_geller ..And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
jack_geller Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'.
monica_geller That's probably what they'll say.
jack_geller I'd like that.
chandler_bing Hey, gorgeous.
shelly Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-
chandler_bing No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
shelly Oh! Okay! Phew!
chandler_bing So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
shelly I dunno, uh... you just have a-a...
chandler_bing ..Quality, right, great.
shelly Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple.
chandler_bing Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
shelly What? He's cute!
chandler_bing Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
shelly Is Brian...?
chandler_bing No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
shelly Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league.
chandler_bing Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me...I'm really not.
dr_ross_geller This one?
aunt_lillian No.
dr_ross_geller I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
aunt_lillian You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.
judy_geller You're right. We'll go with the burgundy.
dr_ross_geller Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out.
aunt_lillian Wait! We need shoes!
dr_ross_geller Okay. Um, how about these?
judy_geller That's really a day shoe.
dr_ross_geller And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
aunt_lillian Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
dr_ross_geller Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
aunt_lillian No, it really should be burgundy.
judy_geller Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
dr_ross_geller No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
dr_ross_geller Oh my God..
judy_geller Is everything all right, dear?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
dr_ross_geller How we doing, you guys ready?
monica_geller Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
dr_ross_geller Some days it's all I can think about.
phoebe_buffay Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
rachel_green Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
phoebe_buffay What'd I say?
rachel_green Hm-m.
monica_geller Are these the shoes?
rachel_green Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
dr_ross_geller What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
joey_tribbiani Morning. We ready to go?
chandler_bing Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
monica_geller It was a really beautiful service.
judy_geller It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
joey_tribbiani Check it out, Giants-Cowboys.
chandler_bing You're watching a football game at a funeral?
joey_tribbiani No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
chandler_bing You are a frightening, frightening man.
rachel_green Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
dr_ross_geller Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
phoebe_buffay God, what a great day...What? Weather-wise!
dr_ross_geller I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff-
all@ God! Ross!
dr_ross_geller I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
phoebe_buffay Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
dr_ross_geller What, what is it?
phoebe_buffay You missed a belt loop.
dr_ross_geller Oh! No-n-
phoebe_buffay Okay, it's in spasm.
judy_geller Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident.
chandler_bing Oh, no-
andrea Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter.
chandler_bing Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
phoebe_buffay Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
dr_ross_geller I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
monica_geller Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
dr_ross_geller Not the first two, but the second two- woooo!..I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs...
phoebe_buffay Ooh! That's so nice...
dr_ross_geller ..Chandler!
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
andrea You were right.
dr_ross_geller Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most.
rachel_green Oh, well you know who I love the most?
dr_ross_geller No.
rachel_green You!
dr_ross_geller Oh.. you don't get it!
jack_geller Whaddya got there?
joey_tribbiani Just a, uh... hearing disability.
jack_geller What's the score?
joey_tribbiani Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
jack_geller Beautiful!
rachel_green Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
judy_geller Your grandmother would have hated this.
monica_geller Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
judy_geller No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.
monica_geller That sounds like Nana.
judy_geller Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
monica_geller ..I can imagine.
judy_geller I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.
monica_geller That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
judy_geller Tell her what?
monica_geller How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
judy_geller I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
monica_geller Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
judy_geller ..No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.
monica_geller Huh.
judy_geller More wine, dear?
monica_geller Oh, I think so.
judy_geller Those earrings look really lovely on you.
monica_geller Thank you. They're yours.
judy_geller Actually they were Nana's.
jack_geller Now I'm depressed!.. Even more than I was.
rachel_green Hey, who's this little naked guy?
dr_ross_geller That little naked guy would be me.
rachel_green Aww, look at the little thing.
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
chandler_bing Who are those people?
dr_ross_geller Got me.
monica_geller Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
rachel_green Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
monica_geller Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
dr_ross_geller Looks like a fun gang.
joey_tribbiani Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
dr_ross_geller Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
chandler_bing Hey, Lowell.
lowell Hey, Chandler.
chandler_bing So how's it going there in Financial Services?
lowell It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
chandler_bing Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
lowell I know. That's what I told her.
chandler_bing Really.
lowell Yeah.
chandler_bing So- you can tell?
lowell Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.
chandler_bing So you don't think I have a, a quality?
lowell Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.
chandler_bing He is?
lowell Yup, and waaay out of your league.
chandler_bing Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian.
