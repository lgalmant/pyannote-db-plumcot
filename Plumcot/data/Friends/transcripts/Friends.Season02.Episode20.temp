rachel That's not the end.
phoebe Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
monica What about the part where he has rabies?
phoebe He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
richard Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.

monica Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
joey Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
monica Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
chandler Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
joey Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
monica Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
joey No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
chandler Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
monica Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
joey Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
richard Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
chandler Ok, that's Eric.
richard Glad to be of help. Matches.
monica I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
joey I don't know.
monica C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
chandler I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
monica So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
joey How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
chandler Ok, this could be tough.
joey Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
chandler Ooh, you almost had it.

susan You can watch our tape if you want.
ross I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?
carol Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen.
ross Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-

chandler Your boyfriend is so cool.
monica Really?
chandler Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
rachel Wow, he must like you the best.

chandler You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car
joey No problem. Hey Chandler

joey Ok. He kept my dollar.
monica So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
carol Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
susan Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
ross Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
carol Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
ross Buy mommy.
carol_and_susan We love you. Buy.
ross Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
monica Ross.
ross Yeah.
monica Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
joey How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
ross Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
monica You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
joey Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
ross Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
chandler Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
monica So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
joey Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
ross Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
chandler Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
monica You're meeting Richard?
joey Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
chandler Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
monica Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
chandler You hear that? We're the guys.
joey We're the guys.
monica With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
ross Thank you.
ross Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
rachel No luck huh?
ross Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
rachel Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
ross What're you doing?
rachel Uh, I'm holding Ben.
ross Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
rachel Ok.
ross Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
rachel This is how I would hold a football.
ross Ok, here, here. There we go.
rachel Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
ross It's alright, it's no big deal.
rachel Really?
ross Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
rachel What?
ross What?
rachel You think about stuff like that?
ross Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
rachel Two, two babies?
ross Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
rachel Then what's gonna happen?
ross Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
rachel Uh-huh.
ross Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
rachel Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
ross Huh?
rachel I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
phoebe Hey.
richard Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
phoebe Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
monica So you watched the movies huh?
phoebe Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
richard Charlotte who?
phoebe With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
monica Alright, you wanna feel better?
phoebe Yeah.
monica Ok, here, watch this.
monica So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
phoebe Please, I almost fell for that with, uh,
richard Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
phoebe Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
chandler Hey, big guy, game time.
richard Hey, be right there.
monica There's a game?
chandler Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
richard It's the basketball playoffs.
monica Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
richard Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
monica Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
richard Uh, it's the college playoffs.
monica Oh, then go Vassar.
richard Uh, they're not in it.
monica Ok, then just go.
richard Ok.
monica Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
phoebe Sure.
monica It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
phoebe Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
rachel Aghh.
phoebe Me too.
monica I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
rachel Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
monica Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
ross Ok, what the hell happened back there?
rachel I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
ross Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
rachel Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
ross C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
rachel Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
ross No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
rachel What was the book?
ross The big book of childrens' names.
rachel Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
ross Yeah.
rachel But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
ross Ok fine.
rachel Thank you.
ross We're not done.
rachel I didn't know that.
ross Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
rachel Fine, I will.
ross Good, 'cause I love you.
rachel Oh yeah.
ross Yeah.
rachel Well I love you too.
ross Well that's the first time we've said that.
rachel Yes it is.
ross Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
rachel Well you better.
phoebe Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
monica Did you like it?
phoebe Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
monica Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
phoebe I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
chandler Kick save and... denied.
richard But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
joey Man you are incredible.
richard Well, we had a table in college.
chandler Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
richard Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
monica Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
richard Ok, just one more point.
monica Score! Now can we go?
chandler See, that's why we don't let her play.
richard Is everything all right?
monica Um-hmm.
richard Uh-oh.
chandler Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
joey Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
richard Well.
joey No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
richard Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
joey Oh yeah.
chandler No.
joey Nooooo.
chandler Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
richard Uh-huh, yeah.
chandler No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
richard That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
monica Nighty-nite.
chandler You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
joey Not a dad.
chandler I can't believe you got us into trouble.
monica So are you ok?
richard Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
monica Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
richard What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
monica Yeah, well they suck too.
ross Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
rachel Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
ross Hello.
carol It's us.
ross Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
rachel Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.

ernie Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey.
phoebe Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
ernie Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost.
phoebe Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
