chandler This coming from the man who couldn't split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.
woman Hi!
joey Hi!
woman How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?
joey Oh that's on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.
woman Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?
joey Well, he's not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with him - He says it's okay. Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!
ross Hey Joey, how come our stuff isn't free?
joey It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! I'm getting more dates than ever!
rachel Wait a minute, you're only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?
phoebe Yeah Joey that is so gross!
joey How about a scone on the house baby?
phoebe I'm pretty.
ross Hey does anyone have any gum?
phoebe Oh I do! Oh, y'know what? No. Wait a second. I know it's in here somewhere.
ross Y'know what? I'm good! I'm good!
monica Hey!
ross Hey!
chandler Hey, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work?
monica Ugh, they sent me home. They said I can't work if I'm sick.
all Ohh!
chandler I'm so sorry you're sick.
monica I'm not sick!! I don't get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!
rachel Honey, no one thinks you're a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue.
monica I have not been sick in over three years!
chandler I'm gonna grab you some tissue.
monica I don't need a tissue! I'm fine-d!
ross When you put a 'D' at the end of 'Fine' you're not fine.
monica I'm fine-d. I'm fine-d! Y'know, it's a really hard word to say.
chandler Yes?
woman Hi, is Rachel here? I'm her sister.
rachel Oh my God, Jill!
jill Oh my God, Rachel!
chandler Oh my God, introduce us!
rachel This is Chandler.
jill Hi!
rachel And you know Monica and Ross!
ross Hi Jill.
rachel And that's Phoebe , and that's Joey.
joey Hey, how you doin'?
rachel Don't!! Honey, what are you doing here?!
phoebe Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or that's bitter?
jill Daddy cut me off.
phoebe Never mind, I got it.
jill And y'know what I said to him? "I'm gonna hire a lawyer and I'm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then I'm gonna cut you off!"
rachel Wow! What did he say?
jill That he wouldn't pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter he's actually proud off.
rachel Oh! Did you hear that?! My dad's proud of me! My dad's proud of me.
monica Rach?
rachel Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?
jill Okay, I bought a boat.
monica You bought a boat?
jill Yeah but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.
chandler Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister!
rachel Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! I'm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what you're gonna do. You're gonna get a job, you're gonna get an apartment, and then I'll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?
phoebe Of course, yeah!
jill Oh, that's so great! Okay, I'm really gonna do this! I don't know how to thank you guys.
phoebe Ooh, I like cards.
joey Are you all finished here?
customer Yes.
joey Great!
gunther Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.
joey What?!
gunther For all the free food you gave away.
joey Well if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?
gunther We don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.
joey Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?
gunther No!
joey Sorry!
jill I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy.
ross Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.
jill Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. And these are my, "Don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.
ross I don't think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.
jill Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!
phoebe Seriously, I don't Rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.
jill So who made her queen of the world?
phoebe I would love that job!
rachel Hey! What's goin' on?
jill Hey!
rachel Jill! Did you shop?!
jill No! They did!
phoebe_and_ross Yeah, we went shopping!
rachel You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jill's nose when you know she's trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!
phoebe Sorry Jill.
ross Sorry-sorry Jill.
rachel What'd you get?
phoebe Oh well, all right, I got thank you, I got uh, this y'know "I want a job sweater."
rachel Oh.
phoebe And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.
rachel Apartment pants?
phoebe Yeah, you never heard of them?
rachel No, of course, of course I've heard of them! Ross, what did you get?
ross Huh? Oh, I got this - - this!
rachel A pajmena?
ross Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!
rachel Really?
ross Ross, wants a pajmena?
ross It's a rug.
rachel Jill?
jill I'm sorry Rachel, I'm sorry
rachel Oh, come on! You think that's gonna work on me?! I invented that!
jill Right! But, I am sorry.
rachel All right, it's okay. One little setback is okay, just don't let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But I'm just gonna take the-the pajmena. And the uh, and the uh pants. Y'know what, I'm just gonna take it all away, 'cause that way you'll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, I'm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner.
jill She took all my stuff.
ross Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one.
jill That's the best one! Oh my God, thank you so much!
ross Well. Hey
jill Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!
ross Oh yeah, how about you and the, "I'm sorry!"
jill Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!
phoebe What about, what about when I said y'know about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?
jill Were you this cute in high school?
ross Oh stop.
jill No you stop!
ross No, you stop!
jill You stop!
phoebe Okay-okay, why don't I sit here and you'll both stop it!
monica Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Let's do something crazy!
chandler I know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.
monica Okay, I'll rest. But y'know if I'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.
chandler That would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.
monica Are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?
chandler Yeah, I don't you should say that even when you're healthy.
monica Come on.
chandler Don't take this personally okay? It's just that I just can't have sex with a sick person.
monica I'm with you Chandler! I mean I can't have sex with a sick person either, that's disgusting! But I'm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.
chandler That's the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.
rachel Hey!
phoebe Hey.
rachel What's up?!
phoebe Umm, I think there's something you should maybe know.
rachel Well, it'd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.
phoebe No. No. It's just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, I'm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.
rachel What?!
phoebe Yeah I mean it's probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.
rachel With Ross and Jill?
phoebe Yeah!
rachel With Ross and my sister?
phoebe Yeah.
rachel With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?
phoebe Yeah.
rachel Oh there is no way.
phoebe Okay then.
rachel Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I don't really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isn't that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and they're gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I can't stop it! I can't - I don't own Ross! Y'know? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I can't believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.
phoebe But great news about the apartment pants, huh?
joey That'll be $3.85.
woman What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!
joey It's just I can't because my manager said I... "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annie
woman Amy!
joey "... Amy! Happy birthday to you!"
a_male_customer Hey, that's weird, today's my birthday too!
joey Yeah, not it here it isn't.
jill Sorry I'm late, what's up?
rachel Oh hi! Y'know, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.
jill Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didn't go in. How strong am I?
rachel That is great. Hey, y'know who doesn't have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.
jill Yeah.
rachel Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think you're gonna go out?
jill Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?
rachel I just, Phoebe, said y'know thought she saw something between you guys.
jill No! I mean he's nice.
rachel Yeah.
jill He's the kind of guy you're friends with, y'know? But he's not the kind of guy you date. He's the kind of guy you'd date because you did. Me, not so much.
rachel Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?
jill Oh no-no-no, he's just I don't know, he's just a little bookish.
rachel Are-are you saying he's a geek?
jill You think so too?
rachel No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!
jill Fine, then let's just say he's not my type.
rachel What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things aren't on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!
jill Well okay, if it means that much to you, then I'll ask him out.
rachel Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, that's not what I meant.
jill No! Y'know what Rachel? You're right, y'know he has been really nice to me.
rachel Yeah but, he's not your type.
jill Yeah but maybe that's a good thing. Y'know I'm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!
rachel Yeah but, you don't, you don't, you don't want to try to much too fast. Y'know? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast don't you?
jill What?
rachel She-she died Jill.
monica Chandler!
chandler Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? Oh-ohhhh!
monica Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.
chandler Oh Jeez honey, I thought, I thought you were asleep.
monica How could I be asleep knowing that you were in the next room.
chandler I was asleep. Oh no! No-no honey! Y'know what's sexy? Layers. Layers are sexy. And blankets are sexy. And oh! Hot water bottles are sexy.
monica Come on, get into bed! I want to prove to you that I'm not sick! I wanna make you feel, as good as I feel.
chandler Would you please get some rest!
monica I'm fine.
joey "Happy birthday to you!"
gunther You're paying for that.
joey What? No-no it's her birthday!
gunther You've sung Happy Birthday to 20 different women today!
joey But it really
gunther You are no longer authorized to distribute birthday muffins.
joey Damnit!

rachel Hi!
ross Did you tell your sister to ask me out?
rachel Well yeah
ross Oh wow! I mean, wow! I mean, I-I-I think she's cute but I-I would never have thought of going out with her, never!
rachel Really?!
ross Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"
rachel Oh so-so not really never.
ross I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all we've been through, I just - y'know I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.
joey Oh-ho, and mine!
monica Chandler, I think I'm sick.
chandler Really? Struck down in the pribe of libe!
monica Okay, fine I admit it! I feel terrible! Would you please rub this on my chest?
chandler No-no-no-no-no-no-no, you are not getting me this way.
monica Come on! I really need your help!
chandler No-no-no-no-no!
monica Fine, I'll rub it on myself.
chandler Okay.
chandler So you're just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?
monica Yeah?
chandler It's nice.
monica Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?
chandler Yes!

chandler It's all very, very good. So you wanna go uh, mix it up?
monica Not now, I'm sick!
chandler Oh come on you big faker!
