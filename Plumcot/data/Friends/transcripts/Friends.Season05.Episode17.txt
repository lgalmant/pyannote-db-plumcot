joey_tribbiani That's right Ross, I can see you in your new apartment! And you can see me! Same as yesterday, same as the day before.
monica_geller Is he doing his shark attack bit yet?
joey_tribbiani Nope. Op, wait! There he goes.
joey_tribbiani Very funny Ross! Very life-like and funny. Okay. Oh no-no-no, I wasn't waving at you lady. Whoa, maybe I was! Hey, Monica, this totally hot girl in Ross's building is flirting with me.

garys_radio#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 We've lost visual contact with the suspect.
gary Okay, now I've really have to go!
phoebe_buffay But it's just so unfair that our date has to get cut short just 'cause some guy shot at a store clerk.
gary I know, but it's my job, sweethart!
phoebe_buffay Okay, then maybe I can come too!
garys_radio#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 Suspect has just emerged naked from the sewer.
phoebe_buffay All right, you go.

phoebe_buffay 'Kay, bye!
phoebe_buffay Oh God!
monica_geller What?
phoebe_buffay Oh I just miss him so much!
monica_geller Wow! For just a week you guys are really close, huh?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, it's weird. I can't help it though he's so sweet, he's like this little puppy dog, y'know? But like a really tough one that shots bad guys. Ohh, I just love beginning parts of relationships, y'know?! You just like can't keep your hands off each other.
monica_geller I know it is the best.
phoebe_buffay So-so how long did that last for you and Chandler?
monica_geller What? It's still going on.
phoebe_buffay Come on, seriously! When did it end?
monica_geller I-I am serious, I mean, we're, we're all over each other all the time.
phoebe_buffay Okay, you know where you are better than I do. I was just curious.
monica_geller What don't you just calm down Phoebe! All right?! Why don't you just get all your facts before you run around telling everybody that you're the only hot couple!!
phoebe_buffay God, I woke the beast. Sorry. I was wrong obviously, I just-I misspoke. It's okay.
monica_geller Oh no, it is okay, I mean as long as you know that Chandler and I are also very hot and fiery, just as hot as you! I mean our flame, whew, is on fire!
chandler_bing Hey Monica, here's your broom back.
monica_geller You are so cute.
chandler_bing Oh hey, how'd the interview go?
rachel_green Ugh, horrible! I did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing!
joey_tribbiani Did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife and then fall right out of your chair?
rachel_green No!
chandler_bing So what happened?
rachel_green Ugh, it was horrible! And-and the interview part went so well, y'know? I even made him laugh. He said something about a boat and I was like, "Well, yeah! If you've got enough life jackets!" Trust me, it was actually, it was very funny. Anyway, so we were saying good-bye and ugh!
joey_tribbiani What happened?
rachel_green All right, we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me... Y'know maybe he was going to open the door, but I totally miss read him and I uhhh
joey_tribbiani You kissed him?!
rachel_green Well, I didn't know what else to do!
chandler_bing Well you coulda tried, not kissing him.
rachel_green Thanks Chandler.
monica_geller Hey Rach, a guy from Ralph Lauren called, you got a second interview!
rachel_green I can't believe it! I got a second interview!
monica_geller Yes!
joey_tribbiani I bet that kiss isn't looking like such a big mistake now, is it?
rachel_green What-what, wait a minute, you don't think that's why he wants me back?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! No?
monica_geller A kiss? What are you talking about?
rachel_green I accidentally kissed him in the interview, and now he wants me back y'know of course, 'cause "Let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody!"
chandler_bing Come on, Rach.
rachel_green Oh my God! What if he thinks I'm the kind of girl that-that would just sleep with him?
monica_geller He probably wants you back because you're right for the job.
rachel_green Maybe. I-I don't know-Oh God, how could I be so stupid?!
joey_tribbiani Oh Rachel look, don't say that, I think you just need a hug from Joey. Come on. Come on. She's back! Hot girl's back!

phoebe_buffay Oh we can't, we already have plans.
monica_geller What are you doing?
phoebe_buffay Well, same thing we did all day, hang out at Gary's apartment. He is so amazing, we never left the bedroom. But have fun at the movie.
monica_geller Oh, we're not seeing a movie!
phoebe_buffay You're not? Then why did you ask us if we wanted to go?
monica_geller Oh umm, that's because I just wanted to y'know walk in on me and Chandler while we were, y'know, doing it all night. Will you excuse me for just a second?
phoebe_buffay Yeah!
monica_geller Okay. Chandler? Can I see you for a second?
chandler_bing Uh, yeah.
monica_geller Okay. We have got to beat them! {Here we go yet again.}
chandler_bing Why?
monica_geller 'Cause, Gary and Phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are!
chandler_bing Ohh, so?
monica_geller So! So we've got to go upstairs and have a lot of sex to prove them wrong!
chandler_bing Monica, you have got to stop this competitive thing! Okay? It's crazy. {Finally! The voice of reason.} I mean, just impress Gary and Phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I'm saying no to this, why? Get your coat.
dr_ross_geller Hey!
the_man Excuse me. You should check this out, tell the other tenants. Apparently he's running around looking for some kind of a hot girl.
dr_ross_geller Who isn't?
dr_ross_geller I don't, I don't think we've meet. I-I'm Ross.
the_window_woman I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
dr_ross_geller Nevermind!
the_window_woman No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in.
dr_ross_geller I had just moved in. Thank you! Listen umm
the_window_woman Jen.
dr_ross_geller Jen, I know this may sound a little... But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or
jen#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 Sure! That would be nice.
dr_ross_geller Umm?
jen#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 Oh! My number is on there. Give me a call.
dr_ross_geller I will give you a call.
jen#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 I'll see you later.
dr_ross_geller Okay!
jen#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 I forgot my paper.
chandler_bing That was amazing!
monica_geller Phoebe and Gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.
chandler_bing That was amazing.
monica_geller We are the hottest! Huh? No one is hotter than we are! You're the best.
chandler_bing No, you're the best.
monica_geller No, you're the best.
chandler_bing No, you're the best.
monica_geller I am the best.
joey_tribbiani Hey guys! What 'cha been doin'?
monica_geller Hey Joey! Isn't that the girl that waved at you the other day?
joey_tribbiani I don't know. But I can see through your sheet. Yeah, yeah, that's her. But y'know what? Doesn't matter, I'm never gonna get to meet her anyway.
monica_geller Why?
joey_tribbiani Because it's impossible to find her apartment! She lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe, or something.
monica_geller What are you talking about? She obviously lives on the second floor, seventh apartment from the left!
joey_tribbiani No. No. No. She lives on the third floor, eighth apartment from the left.
monica_geller No, those first two windows, that's the lobby. And y'know the other one over there, that's the stairway. You've been counting wrong.
joey_tribbiani I did not know that! Thank you Monica. I can't believe I almost lost another girl because of counting.
dr_ross_geller So uhh, you ready?
jen#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode17 Sure, I'll just get my coat. Could you get that?
dr_ross_geller Sure. Joey
joey_tribbiani Dahhhhh!! No! Noooo!!
rachel_green Ah, first, I-I would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.
mr_zelner That's quite all right, but I feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.
rachel_green Okay. Umm, well, first I would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh, for yelling at you.
mr_zelner Fair enough.
rachel_green Now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah, who did, who did not umm, yell at you and storm out, and I think that's a big mistake and here's why. I made a huge fool of myself and I came back, that shows courage. When I thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, I said no. That shows integrity. And, I was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage. Okay umm, now I know I already said courage, but y'know you gotta have courage. And umm, and finally when I thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace, I said no and I was not litigious. {By the way, litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against. So she didn't want to sue him. Don't worry, I had to look it up too.} So there you go, you got, you got courage, you got integrity, you got courage again, and not litigious. Look Mr
mr_zelner Zelner.
rachel_green Zelner! Right! I knew that! I really, really want this job and I think, I think I would be really good at it.
mr_zelner Y'know what? I may regret this but uh, I'm going to give you a shot.
rachel_green Oh! You are?
mr_zelner Um-hmm.
rachel_green Really? Oh thank you! Oh... Oh, would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug?
mr_zelner Yes!
rachel_green Okay, well then how about a handshake? Oh God I'm sorry! Oh God, I'm sorry! I did not mean to touch that-I mean you there. There. Uhh, okay, so thank-thank you, I'm going to leave now thank you very much uh-huh, thank you so-Hey! I'll see you Monday!
phoebe_buffay You tired Chandler?
monica_geller You better believe he's tired, after the day we had! If you know what I mean. You know what I mean?
chandler_bing Honey, the tortilla chips know what you mean.
gary So uh Chandler, you like that badge I got you?
chandler_bing Oh yeah, it's so cool. Now I gotta go, Officer Bing has gotta, 10-100. That's pee-pee.
monica_geller Phoebe, you have a, a twig in your hair.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, umm, we kinda took a little detour on the way over here.
gary Yeah, we took a little stroll in the park and no one was around, so
monica_geller You didn't!
phoebe_buffay We did! We violated Section 12 Paragraph 7 of the criminal code!
monica_geller The park huh? A public place.
gary Uh-huh.
monica_geller I hear ya. Excuse me for just a second!
monica_geller Hi Chandler.
chandler_bing Monica! This is the Men's room! Isn't it?
monica_geller Yes it is. You see I've always found the men's bathroom very sexual. Haven't you?
chandler_bing No. And if I did, I don't think we'd be going out. Monica, this is getting ridiculous!
monica_geller Come on, we can't let them win!
chandler_bing Ugh, we have already proved that we are hot! Okay? So why-why are you getting so obsessed about this thing?!
monica_geller Because Phoebe and Gary are in that-can't-keep-their-hands-off-each-other-doing-it-in-the-park phase!
chandler_bing So?
monica_geller I feel really sad that we're not...really there anymore.
chandler_bing Oh wow! Is that what this all have been about?
monica_geller Wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time?
chandler_bing Yeah that was great. That was really great! But to tell you the truth, I'm more excited about where we are right now.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Yeah! I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before. Y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time, I think that's pretty incredible. And the fact that this is happening all with you, yeah I think that's pretty exciting.
monica_geller That is so sweet. I know that I was acting a little crazy but umm, I feel the same way.
chandler_bing Yeah?
monica_geller Yeah.
chandler_bing Y'know what I just realized? You just freaked out about our relationship.
monica_geller Did not.
chandler_bing Yes you did! Admit it! You freaked out!
monica_geller Okay, I freaked out a little.
chandler_bing Little?! You freaked out big time! Okay? And I fixed it! We have switched places! I am the relationship and king and you are the crazy, irrational screw up! And now we're back.
rachel_green I cannot believe Ross is buying this!
monica_geller Thank God! I can't watch him anymore!
chandler_bing You guys ready fore the movies?
rachel_green Yeah! Oh by the way, thank you for loaning us Pamela and Yasmine.
dr_ross_geller Man! They cannot get enough!
