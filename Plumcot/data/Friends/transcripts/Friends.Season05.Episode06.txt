joey_tribbiani Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!! None of that, not while you're living under my roof!
monica_geller What?!
joey_tribbiani Look, just because I know about you two, doesn't mean I like looking at it.
chandler_bing Aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm sorry if I'm not a middle-aged black woman! And I'm also sorry if sometimes I go to the wrong audition! Okay, look, if I have to pretend I don't know about you two, then you two are gonna have to pretend there's nothing to know about.
chandler_bing@monica_geller Okay.
monica_geller Sorry.
chandler_bing Sorry.
joey_tribbiani I can hear that!
monica_geller Rachel's at work.
joey_tribbiani I can still hear you!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hello!
monica_geller Hey, what's that?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother. Can you believe it?! A year ago I didn't even have a family, and now I have heirlooms for crying out loud.
phoebe_buffay Eeeee--ohh!! God!
joey_tribbiani Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!
chandler_bing Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour. That didn't happen, I made that up!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
gunther Oh, Ross? Ross! You can't put up flyers in here.
dr_ross_geller How come? Everybody else does.
gunther You can't.
monica_geller What is that?
dr_ross_geller Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.
monica_geller This is all of your things.
dr_ross_geller Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.
monica_geller So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.
dr_ross_geller Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.
gunther I'll take it all.
joey_tribbiani Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?
dr_ross_geller Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.
chandler_bing Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?
dr_ross_geller After what I did? Can you blame her?
phoebe_buffay Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.
joey_tribbiani What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?
monica_geller Now calm down Joey.
joey_tribbiani No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
chandler_bing Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence
monica_geller Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?
joey_tribbiani No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.
rachel_green Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?
monica_geller Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.
rachel_green I want the little round waffles.
monica_geller All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?
rachel_green Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!
rachel_green Arghhhh!!!!!!
monica_geller Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!
phoebe_buffay I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.
joey_tribbiani I'll take it!
phoebe_buffay That might work!
joey_tribbiani Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah! Enh? All right, what do you think?
chandler_bing You're on in 5 Ms. Minnelli.
dr_ross_geller No-no-no, it's just a bit sudden. No, it's great. Okay? I'm totally on board. I love you too, all righty. Bye.
joey_tribbiani What's the matter Ross?
dr_ross_geller Nothing. Oh, actually, great news! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment. Woo-hoo!
phoebe_buffay Why?
dr_ross_geller Well, her thought is, and I agree, fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment? Her cousin has this great place to sublet, it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other.
joey_tribbiani That's way uptown! That's like three trains away! Which is great! I love to ride that rail!
chandler_bing So you're really okay with this?
dr_ross_geller Yes! Yes! I mean it's-it's kinda far from work, but uh, y'know, I'll get so much done on the commute. I-I've been given the gift of time!
chandler_bing Now that's so funny, because last Christmas I got the gift of space. We should get them together and make a continuum.
joey_tribbiani Now he's movin'? Man, what is Emily doing to him? Ow!! He's not even here!!!
rachel_green You guys! You guys!
monica_geller We were, we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man!
rachel_green It was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast man! He was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
monica_geller And he came at us with an axe, so Rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
rachel_green Yeah, I-I-I just pulled the tab and I just fogged his yeti ass!
joey_tribbiani Uhh, like dark hair, bushy beard?
rachel_green Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you fogged Danny.
rachel_green Please! We did not fog Danny! Who's Danny?
joey_tribbiani Dan just moved in downstairs. Yeah, he just got back from like this four-month trek in the Andes. Nice fella.
monica_geller Oh he's nice. He's nice! Y'know, you always stick up for the people we fog!
danny Yeah?
rachel_green Hi! You might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.
monica_geller We're-we're really sorry we fogged you.
danny Okay.
rachel_green Hi! Just so you know, we-we didn't mean to fog you, we thought you were like a yeti or something.
danny Okay.
danny Yesss?
rachel_green Hi! Sorry to bother you, but I don't think we can accept your acceptance of our apology, it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.
monica_geller Yeah.
danny O-kay!
monica_geller Wow! That guy is so rude!
rachel_green Really! What is with that guy? I mean you'd forgive me if I fogged you.
monica_geller Well you did a little bit.
rachel_green Oh my God, honey, I'm so sorry!
monica_geller I totally forgive you!
rachel_green Really?
monica_geller Yes!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
phoebe_buffay So listen, you know my friend Chris who owns the crematorium?
monica_geller Crematorium Chris? Sure!
phoebe_buffay He says, that he would cremate my fur coat for free if I umm, y'know, bring in the next person I know who dies.
rachel_green Oh my God! Oh my God, look at these pelts!
monica_geller Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.
rachel_green What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!
phoebe_buffay This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.
dr_ross_geller I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.
chandler_bing Okay, what is in here? Rocks?
dr_ross_geller No-no, this is my collection of fossil samples.
chandler_bing So, rocks.
dr_ross_geller I'm really gonna miss this apartment. Y'know, Ben-Ben took his first steps right over there.
joey_tribbiani Ohh. Hey, remember when I ran into this thing and it kinda knocked me out a little?
dr_ross_geller I loved this place! To tell you the truth, I wish I didn't have to move.
joey_tribbiani Uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
dr_ross_geller Well, I mean if uh, if Emily gave me a choice
joey_tribbiani You do have a choice!! Ross, why are you listening to her?! Are you, are you crazy?!
dr_ross_geller Why?
joey_tribbiani It's not right what Emily wants you to do! She is totally--Owww!! Stop pinching me! Look, now you guys said I only had to keep my mouth shut as long as Ross was happy, right? Well he just told me that he's not entirely happy.
dr_ross_geller What's going on?
joey_tribbiani We all hate Emily!
phoebe_buffay Nooo!!
monica_geller No, Ross, we do not hate Emily. We-we just, we just think that you're having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy.
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.
joey_tribbiani Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!
dr_ross_geller Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!
phoebe_buffay I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.
monica_geller God, I feel so guilty about Ross.
phoebe_buffay Oh, I know.
joey_tribbiani I kinda feel like it's my fault.
chandler_bing Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
joey_tribbiani Well, I'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
chandler_bing Well, I think it's very brave what you said.
phoebe_buffay All right, I can't sit here anymore. I have to walk places.
chandler_bing Pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? How about the whole animal rights thing?
phoebe_buffay Well, I've been reading up and for your information, minks are not very nice. Okay, I admit it! I love this coat! Okay, I-it's the best thing I've ever had wrapped around me, including Phil Huntley! Remember Phil Huntley? He was fine!
rachel_green Hi!
danny So you like the short hair better.
rachel_green What? Yeti-I mean Danny?
danny I had to cut my hair to get rid of the uh, fogger smell.
rachel_green Oh. Listen, I'm so sorry. I would, I would've never fogged you if y'know if you hadn't looked so.... Y'know.
danny Absolutely. Some people are just into appearances.
rachel_green What?
danny That's cool. Cool.
rachel_green What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!
danny Come on, you got the shopping bags and the Sack's catalog.
rachel_green So from that you think you've got me all figured out? Well, you don't! Y'know I-I could have toys for underprivileged kids in here!
danny Do you?
rachel_green Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.
danny Okay.
rachel_green And stop saying that! I hate that!
danny Okay!
rachel_green Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?
danny The pizza-place across the street any good?
rachel_green What?!
danny I'm hungry. Wanna get some pizza? You can keep yelling if there's more.
rachel_green Okay. Okay.
danny Stop saying that. I hate that.
chandler_bing Uh, Ross?
phoebe_buffay Are you still mad at us?
dr_ross_geller Yep.
phoebe_buffay Oh good! Because we have an "I'm sorry" song.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I'm really not in the mood.
joey_tribbiani Look, Ross, I feel really bad. I mean, you're going through all this stuff and I just acted like a jerk.
chandler_bing Yeah, we are so sorry.
phoebe_buffay You're kinda stepping on the song.
joey_tribbiani Look, we were way out of line, we totally support you.
monica_geller Whatever you decide, whatever you do.
phoebe_buffay Okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song!
dr_ross_geller Look, this is hard enough! I really need you guys right now.
phoebe_buffay Yes! Exactly! And that's why
monica_geller Why don't you come over tonight? And I'll make you favorite dinner.
dr_ross_geller Okay. Thanks you guys. Pheebs are you wearing fur?
phoebe_buffay Okay, let's get some perspective people; it's not like I'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat!
joey_tribbiani Hey, y'know Ross, I think I kinda understand why I kinda lost it today.
dr_ross_geller You do, huh?
joey_tribbiani Yeah you see umm, well, I'm an actor. Right? So I gotta keep my emotions right at the surface y'know? See what I'm saying? I gotta lot of balls in the air. Y'know what I mean? It's tough! Guys like me, y'know, you wander around, you're alone
dr_ross_geller What are you talking about?
joey_tribbiani I'm not sure.
rachel_green Hi!
monica_geller Hey, look at you! Where have you been?
rachel_green Oh, I went to have pizza. With Danny.
monica_geller How did that happen?
rachel_green That yeti is one smooth talker.
monica_geller I hope you're not full, 'cause dinner's almost ready.
rachel_green Yeah, y'know I-I think I'm just gonna hang out in my room.
all@ No! Why?
rachel_green Come on you guys! Listen, if Emily knew I was here having dinner you with you she would flip out and you know it. It's okay, I really... I don't mind.
dr_ross_geller Wait! Wait! Wait! Y'know what? Just stay. Please? It uh... It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed.
rachel_green Ross, I
joey_tribbiani RACHEL PLEASE!!! JUST HAVE DINNER WITH US!!!
rachel_green Okay. Okay. Joey, it's okay. Settle down.
joey_tribbiani All right, I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You see Rach I'm an actor
dr_ross_geller Hey! Hey, look! Ugly Naked Guy's back!
rachel_green I haven't seen him in so long!
phoebe_buffay Oh God, I really missed that fat bastard!
monica_geller Wow, this is so weird. I just realized this might be the last time we'll all be hanging out together.
joey_tribbiani It's almost as if he knew.
monica_geller I'll get it. Hello. Hi Emily! Yeah, uh you-you tracked him down. Hold on one second.
dr_ross_geller Hey! Yeah-yeah, we're just having dinner. Uh, yeah, sure uh hold on. She wants to say hi. Hold on.
phoebe_buffay Hi Emily!
chandler_bing Hi!
emily_waltham Hello everyone. So who am I saying hello too?
joey_tribbiani Well uh, I don't know about who's here, but I can tell you for damn sure who's not here and that's Rachel!!
emily_waltham Well, I should hope not. Ross knows better than that by now.
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? Uh, Rachel is here!
emily_waltham She's there?!
chandler_bing Oh yeah, there-there she is!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yeah, she's here.
emily_waltham Ross, take me off speakerphone.
dr_ross_geller Hi.
emily_waltham How can you do this too me?! I thought I'd made my feelings about Rachel perfectly clear!
dr_ross_geller Look Emily, I'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?
emily_waltham You obviously can't keep away from her.
dr_ross_geller Emily that's ridiculous. Look, I'm-I'm moving for you, I'm cutting friends out of my life for you. Please, just get on the plane and come to New York. Okay, you'll see you're the only person I want to be with.
emily_waltham I'll feel better when I'm there, and I can know where you are all the time.
dr_ross_geller Well, you can't know where I am all the time. Look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.
emily_waltham You're right.
dr_ross_geller So, can you trust me?
emily_waltham No.
joey_tribbiani I think it's going okay. Looks like he's smiling.
monica_geller How can you tell? You can only see the back of his head!
joey_tribbiani You can totally tell! Here look, watch me. Smile! Frown. Smile! Frown. Smile!
dr_ross_geller Well, I guess that's it.
all@ Why, what happened?
joey_tribbiani What happened? What happened?
dr_ross_geller My marriage is over.
all@ What?!
monica_geller Oh, sweetie. Oh, look at you. You're shivering.
phoebe_buffay Here.
rachel_green Ross, honey, is there anything we can do?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther.
phoebe_buffay Okay, stop tormenting me! This mink! Okay, they're mean! And they hate squirrels! And y'know, okay, most of these probably wanted to be coats! All right, fine, now I get it. Here. You take it. Are you happy now? I'm cold!
