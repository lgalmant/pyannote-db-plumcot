dr_ross_geller So honey this uh, this threesome thing umm, I mean how-how are you gonna start to find
carol_willick Ooh, actually I've been making a list of all the women I know who might be into doing this!
dr_ross_geller Oh. Wow! Huh. Boy! Well, someone's been doing their homework.
carol_willick Yeah. Ooh, and I know Gail Rosten is in there twice, but she is so
dr_ross_geller Oh, I know. Y'know, just-just talking about it is getting me kinda
carol_willick Oh, me too.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Well, I-I think Ben's asleep.
carol_willick Oh umm, y'know I think it would be better if we just save it.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Right. Save it. I can do that.
dr_ross_geller Hey, Pheebs!
phoebe_buffay Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey, how's it going?
phoebe_buffay Well, I've got to get out of this bed, I'm going crazy here. Crazy!
monica_geller Here you go sweetie.
phoebe_buffay What the hell is this, herbal tea? I hate herbal tea!
monica_geller But, I put some honey in it.
dr_ross_geller She doesn't know she was fired yet, does she?
chandler_bing No, the doctors say it may kill her.
phoebe_buffay What are you two girls whispering about over there?!
chandler_bing But I think we should tell her.
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, maybe this whole heart attack thing is a sign, that-that you should start think about getting a different job.
phoebe_buffay Okay, what is this? A stupid contest? Because we got a winner here!
chandler_bing Listen Phoebe, he's right. People are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31.
phoebe_buffay I know! But if I didn't work there, what else would I do?
monica_geller Well, you used to like playing the guitar.
phoebe_buffay Yeah that was lucrative! Smart like your brother!
chandler_bing Uh, what about y'know the massage thing? That never gave you a heart attack.
phoebe_buffay Hmm, pulling in a salary in the high six figures or rubbing gross naked people for chump change-ooh, what do I do?! What will I do?!
rachel_green Ohh, I mean it's just so realistic!
joey_tribbiani I know. Yeah, his name is Pat.
rachel_green Pat the dog. Oh! Oh! I get it!!
joey_tribbiani Do you uh, do you-ready for a refill?
rachel_green Oh, I probably shouldn't-so I will! Oh! Wow! It's like it's raining!
joey_tribbiani Pretty cool, huh? But if you're thinking you can put a fish in there and it wouldn't get sucked up into the mechanism, well you'd be wrong.
rachel_green Umm, can I use your bathroom?
joey_tribbiani It's uh, right through there.
rachel_green Okay. God y'know, if someone told me a week ago that I would be peeing in Joey Tribbiani's apartment
joey_tribbiani Yeah, life's pretty great isn't it?
rachel_green Yeah, it sure is!
monica_geller I hope you're hungry, we're starting with oysters. And y'know what they say about oysters, don't you?
dr_roger They have parasites?
monica_geller No! Umm well, some people say that Oysters are an aphrodisiac.
dr_roger What people?
monica_geller People! People say it! Come here!
dr_roger So oysters, huh?
monica_geller And then we're gonna have a little Middle Eastern cous-cous. Something we can eat, with our hands.
dr_roger Y'know, it's funny, but when we were studying communicable diseases
monica_geller No-no-no, no! It's sensual!
dr_roger Ohh! Didn't know! Okay!
monica_geller Okay! Ohhh no!
dr_roger I'm sorry sweetie, it's the hospital. The food looks great, maybe save me some?
monica_geller I can't promise anything.
dr_ross_geller We're really gonna do this, huh?
carol_willick Looks like it.
dr_ross_geller Y'know, if, if this is too weird for you, we can still back out at
carol_willick I got it!
dr_ross_geller Okay.
carol_willick Susan! Hi!
susan_bunch Hey!
carol_willick Thank you so much for coming.
susan_bunch Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world.
dr_ross_geller I'm-I'm Ross by the way.
susan_bunch Hello Ross. I love what you've done with this space.
carol_willick Thank you so much.
dr_ross_geller How hot is this?!
chandler_bing I'm sorry you're here with me instead of Roger.
monica_geller Yeah, me too.
chandler_bing Well, I could make it seem like he's here. "Here's some little known facts about cous-cous. They didn't add the second cous until 1979."
monica_geller Stop it!! That's not funny!!
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller I'm sorry, okay? It just-tonight was supposed to be y'know, it was supposed to be a big deal.
chandler_bing What was tonight?
monica_geller You don't want to know what tonight was.
chandler_bing Okay. What was tonight?
monica_geller Well, tonight was-was going to be my first time.
chandler_bing With Roger? Not just with Roger?! Oh my God!
monica_geller All right relax Mr. I've Had Sex Four Times!
chandler_bing Four different women! I've had sex way more times!
monica_geller How many?
chandler_bing Nine.
monica_geller I was just waiting for the perfect guy.
chandler_bing Well good, good for you. You really think that Roger is the perfect guy?
monica_geller No. He's not a horrible guy.
chandler_bing Hey that's what I tell girls about me.
monica_geller Chandler, I'm gonna die a virgin!
chandler_bing No you are not! You are sweet and wonderful and this is gonna happen for you.
monica_geller Oh really? When? Do you wanna do it with me?
chandler_bing Okay.
monica_geller I was kidding.
chandler_bing So was I.
rachel_green Joey, you're such an amazing actor! How do you know where Dr. Drake Remoray leaves off and Joey Tribbiani begins?
joey_tribbiani Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.
rachel_green Wow! Tell me something Joey--Whoa! I just fell right off the couch there.
joey_tribbiani Yeah you did.
rachel_green Okay.
joey_tribbiani Here you go. Let me ask you a question.
rachel_green Yeah?
joey_tribbiani When was the last time someone told you just how beautiful you are?
rachel_green Wow! I can't, I can't feel my hands.
joey_tribbiani Come, come here.
chandler_bing We can't do this.
monica_geller No! Oyster?
chandler_bing Yeah! If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, y'know? Because you've been waiting a very long time and I wouldn't want to disappoint you.
monica_geller Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if you're horrible, how would I know?
chandler_bing I do like that.
monica_geller It's harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!
chandler_bing Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?
monica_geller Absolutely! It would just be one friend helping out another friend.
chandler_bing Stop it! We're doing this! Let's do it!
monica_geller Noo!! Okay!!
chandler_bing Okay!
monica_geller Umm, do you have any uhh, moves?
chandler_bing I have some moves.
monica_geller I have no moves. Okay, whatcha doin' there?! Oh y'know what? I'm sorry, this is just too weird.
chandler_bing Yeah, let's just forget it.
monica_geller What if I turn out the lights?
chandler_bing Okay!
chandler_bing Oh yeah.
monica_geller Chandler?
chandler_bing Yeah?
monica_geller That's the couch.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
monica_geller I know! I'll tell you something, we are gonna do that again!
chandler_bing Oh, okay!
joey_tribbiani Morning!
rachel_green Oh right.
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
rachel_green Oh God. Oh I can't believe Joey Tribbiani heard me throw up!
joey_tribbiani Well he actually saw you a little bit too.
rachel_green Noo! Oh God we did-we didn't, we didn't uhh
joey_tribbiani No! No! No, not after seeing that.
rachel_green God I'm just a horrible person.
joey_tribbiani Wh-why?
rachel_green Because I'm married. That's right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV star's apartment to have an affair! Uck!
joey_tribbiani That's ridiculous! I'm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.
rachel_green Yeah and I'm a horrible, horrible person.
joey_tribbiani Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave me
rachel_green The ring from the cave, yeah.
joey_tribbiani Wow! Uh okay, well uh
rachel_green Oh my God, they let you keep that stuff?!
joey_tribbiani Sure! As long as they don't find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.
rachel_green No! No-no-no
joey_tribbiani Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, you've had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didn't. And that's what this ring stands for.
rachel_green But I thought that ring stood for Caprice's undying love for her brother.
joey_tribbiani Look, do you want the ring or not?!
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller Look at you! You're up!
joey_tribbiani All right!
phoebe_buffay I thought I'd try to take a walk. Would you pour me some water? I'll be back soon.
joey_tribbiani Whoa-whoa-whoa! You're not gonna use the pay phone to call work, are ya?
phoebe_buffay No. I've learned my lesson.
phoebe_buffay Let's go! Come on! Move it! Come on! Shoes! Briefcase! Thanks Lou, good luck with the gall bladder.
dr_ross_geller Hey Joe did... Did you ever have a threesome?
joey_tribbiani Well uh, look Ross I uh, I think Carol's great and I'm sure you're a very attractive man, but I....
dr_ross_geller No! The reason I'm asking is that... I sorta had one last night.
joey_tribbiani You?
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
joey_tribbiani Wow!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
joey_tribbiani All right! So, was it amazing?
dr_ross_geller It was, it was okay.
joey_tribbiani Just okay-Did you do it right?!
dr_ross_geller Look, it's just did, did you ever go to a party and think, "Would really anyone miss me if I weren't here?"
joey_tribbiani Huh. But still Ross, you're worst day with two women, pretty much better than any other day! Y'know what I mean?
dr_ross_geller Oh-oh, absolutely!
dr_ross_geller It's just, my part seemed to be over pretty quickly and then, and then there was a lot of waiting around.
joey_tribbiani But you got to be with both of them, right?
dr_ross_geller Not-not really. Th-th-there was just Carol.
joey_tribbiani Not the other one?
dr_ross_geller No, she kept kicking me away!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, you don't want that.
dr_ross_geller No!
joey_tribbiani Well hey, at least you got to see a lot of stuff, right?
dr_ross_geller Oh I a lot of stuff!
joey_tribbiani You got a little bored?
dr_ross_geller A little. Yeah. I made a snack.
joey_tribbiani Yeah? What did ya have?
dr_ross_geller Just a sandwich. Turkey, a little mustard
joey_tribbiani Sounds good.
dr_ross_geller It really was!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Let me tell you about this chick I scored with last night! Oh no wait a minute that was you!
monica_geller Hey, check me out, I'm a slut!
chandler_bing So you uh, want to do something tonight?
monica_geller Oh I can't. Dr. Roger is coming over again.
chandler_bing Oh. Oh right! Right! Because you're still seeing him and uh, he's a good guy. I mean, I remember a time when
monica_geller Are you okay?
chandler_bing Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?
monica_geller Great! It's so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you I'm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"
chandler_bing I bet he can.
monica_geller Y'know, I don't have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. Are you sure you're okay?
chandler_bing Oh yeah! Yeah! Don't worry about me, I'll be fine!
rachel_green Ohh! My God! Barry!!

rachel_green Hi Ross!
dr_ross_geller Hey Rachel.
rachel_green Is Joey Tribbiani here?
dr_ross_geller Umm, no.
rachel_green Well, if you see him, will you please tell him that I'm looking for him and that this I am not gonna throw up!
dr_ross_geller That-that's always good news. Are you okay?
rachel_green Me? I'm great! I'm fine! I'm sooo good!! But, you know who's not great?! Men! You're a man right Ross?!
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Sit down!
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green Let me uh, let me ask you something, do wedding vows mean squat to you people?! And why is it that the second we tell you we're going out of town, bamn there you are in bed with the neighbor's dog walker?!
dr_ross_geller We're sorry.
rachel_green No seriously! Seriously! What has happened to the sanctity of marriage?
dr_ross_geller Didn't you spend last night at Joey's?
rachel_green Aw what are you?! A detective?
dr_ross_geller Look I-I don't know what's going on with you and your husband and what is hopefully an adult dog walker, look can I just say not all men are like that.
rachel_green Oh.
dr_ross_geller Hey! There are some men who will do whatever it takes to make their marriage work! Okay? There are some men who will stand by and-and watch as their wives engage in-in what only can be described as a twosome with some-some woman she barely knows from the gym!
rachel_green Who are these men?
dr_ross_geller Men. I guy I know.
rachel_green Well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife is gay.
dr_ross_geller She is not... She's gay. Oh my God. She is so gay! I can't believe this.
rachel_green Good day for married people huh?
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry your husband cheated on you.
rachel_green I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women aren't that great either.
dr_ross_geller Try telling my wife that.
chandler_bing Okay to come in?
monica_geller Yeah, come on, eat, whatever you want. Dr. Roger got beeped again.
chandler_bing Yeah I know, guess who beeped him?
monica_geller What?!
chandler_bing I'm the ruptured spleen.
monica_geller Why would you do that?
chandler_bing Because you shouldn't be with him. You should be with me.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they don't just happen. Y'know? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning y'know I was just lying there and I couldn't wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always y'know with a friend.
monica_geller Chandler!
chandler_bing I know you probably don't want to go out with me, y'know because I make too many jokes and I've never been in a serious relationship and I guess I'm not technically a "doctor..."
monica_geller There was just one woman, wasn't there?
chandler_bing No, there were two.
monica_geller Including me?
chandler_bing Oh yeah.
