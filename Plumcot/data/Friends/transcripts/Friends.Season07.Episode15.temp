monica I'm glad you're here, we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony.
rachel Ohh
ross What's the matter? You okay?
rachel Yeah, it's just y'know
chandler Monica said wedding.
monica Uh, so anyway, we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony.
rachel Oh! I would love to read a poem.
chandler Do you think you could get through a poem?
rachel It'll be a short one.
monica Okay, so Ross will be doing the reading.
rachel Ohhh
ross Okay. Yeah, I guess, I guess I could do that too.
chandler Too?
ross Yeah, I kind of uh, have something else planned for you guys.
monica Do you mind telling us what it is?
ross Sorry, I'm kinda keeping this one on the Q.T.
chandler Well, whatever it is, I hope it involves winking.
joey Hey!
all Hey!
joey So I just talked to one of the DOOL writers today, and
monica What is DOOL?
joey Days Of Our Lives. Anyway, you're not gonna believe it! My character is coming out of his coma!!
all Oh!!
chandler That's great!
joey And-and-and not only that, I'm gettin' a new brain!!
chandler So great things are happening at work and in your personal life!
rachel Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?
joey Oh well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show, and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body.
ross What? A brain transplant?!
joey Yes, it's a highly controversial procedure.
ross It's ridiculous!
joey Well, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.
ross It's winter, they are fewer people on the street.
monica Who are they killing off?
joey Uh Cecilia Monroe, she plays Jessica Lockhart.
rachel_and_monica Noo!!
monica She's my favorite character on DOOL.
joey Nice.
rachel She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces, I mean I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.
monica And the way she slaps all the time!
rachel Oh!
monica Wouldn't you love to do it just once?!
chandler Don't do it.
rachel Cecilia Monroe man, what a great actress.
joey Oh, tell me about it. And she's been on the show forever, it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
ross Yeah-yeah, help me out here, when you come out of the "brain transplant," you are going to be her?
joey Yes, but in Drake Remoray's body. Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist!
phoebe Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?
rachel Well, I'd have to say gay.
phoebe Yeah? Why?
rachel Well mainly because he's kissing that other guy.
phoebe Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.
rachel Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.
phoebe Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.
rachel All right, straight, and not subtle.
phoebe Ohh, he left his cell phone.
rachel Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.
phoebe Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.
rachel What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
phoebe Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.
rachel What? Wait! Why... why do you get the story?
phoebe I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.
rachel Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
phoebe That wasn't a date! That was, that was just friends getting together... having sex.
rachel Okay. Okay, see? I get the phone.
phoebe No way! No way! You just broke with Tag a week ago.
rachel Yeah! And until now, I didn't think I'd love again.
phoebe Nice try.
rachel Oh hey-hey wait! How do we fairly decide who gets the phone?
phoebe I don't know.
rachel Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!
phoebe Ah-ha! Too cocky!
dina I'm going to keep dating him Mother, and there's nothing you can do about it!
jessica_lockhart Oh yes there is!
dina What are you going to do? Kill him? Like you did with Charles?!
jessica_lockhart That was an accident! And so were you.
dina Well, at least I'm not a murderer!
jessica_lockhart Oh, my baby!
the_director Cut!
joey That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?
cecilia Oh, just years of experience.
dina Can I get some ice here?!
joey Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.
cecilia You're not the fan who's dying are you?
joey Say what?
cecilia I'm supposed to meet and hug a fan whose dying, but that's not supposed to be until later!
joey No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!
cecilia Oh that was a real person?!
joey An-an-anyway I-I just wanted to say that since I'm getting your brain when you leave the show, I was wondering if there was any tips you can give me
cecilia I-I-I'm leaving the show?
joey I don't know. Why? Did you hear something?
cecilia Who told you that?
joey Oh uh, one of the writers.
cecilia Which one? Was it bald or was it tall?
joey Umm
cecilia Y'know what? It doesn't matter! Because it is not true!
joey Okay.
cecilia And if it were true, how dare you come to me ask me for tips about a character that I've been playing for 20 years - I'll give you a tip!
joey Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.
rachel No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.
phoebe Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.
rachel I don't think so.
phoebe Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.
rachel All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.
phoebe Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.
rachel Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.
phoebe Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.
rachel Yes okay. Well now see this isn't telling us anything. Joe. Carlos. Peter. Ooh! Peter Luger! T hat's a steak house!
phoebe Okay, a meat eater. Fine, that's one for you.
rachel Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.
phoebe So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?
rachel His new girlfriend!
monica What is that?
chandler I think it's the dying cat parade.
monica It sounds like it's coming from across the street.
chandler Oh my God!
monica What?
chandler Y'know that thing that Ross was gonna do at our wedding?! He was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said, "You're half Scottish right?"
monica Nooo!!
chandler Yes!!
monica No, there is no way! It can not be Ross! Unbelievable! Why is your family Scottish?!
chandler Why is your family Ross?!
monica He cannot play at our wedding! I mean everyone will leave! I mean come on, that is just noise! It's not even a song!
chandler If you listen very carefully, I think its Celebration by Cool and the Gang.
rachel Hi Pheebs!
phoebe Hi!
rachel How are ya?
phoebe Good.
rachel Umm Pheebs, remember when we were in the coffee house we decided that I was going to keep the uh, the cute guy's cell phone?
phoebe Yeah.
rachel And remember how I said I was going to keep it in my purse so that if it rang I could just pick it up?
phoebe Yeah!
rachel And do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?!
phoebe Ooh, now you lost me.
rachel You stole the phone!
phoebe No I didn't!
rachel No? So you're saying that if I called it, it wouldn't ring?
phoebe No.
rachel Umm, okay. But while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag. Oh, it does work!
rachel Phoebe!
phoebe That is a different phone.
rachel Oh is it?! Uhh, hello? Yes hi, is Rachel there? Yes she is, just one moment please. It's for me!
phoebe That is damning evidence.
rachel Oh my God! I bet that's him. My digital fairy tale is about to begin. I wonder how I should be? Should I be uh Hello? Or should I be Hi! It's Rach... Would you stop doing that?!
phoebe Hello? Yes, I'm the one who found your phone.
rachel Phoebe! You can't do th
phoebe Shhh! I'm on a call! Umm well yeah, you can pick it up tonight, say 8
rachel You do know that I will be here when he comes over.
phoebe Oh? And how will you know what time to come over?
rachel You just said it!
phoebe Oh. Okay, well I-I was kinda hoping that I would just... be alone y'know to think about my mom and her suicide.
rachel Oh Phoebe!
phoebe What?! That's the first time today!
rachel Ohh!
joey So you like the nachos uh? Myself I'm partial to
dina I'm 16.
joey See you in 2003.
cecilia You're absolutely right they are writing me out of the show. They don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently going to be very soon and that's it.
joey I'm so sorry. Look, if it was up to me you would never leave the show.
cecilia Yeah, thanks.
joey No I mean it! I can't believe they would do this to you! And to your fans! I mean they are going to be devastated! Heart broken! They love you so much!
cecilia Oh you're right. Thank you! What's your name again?
joey Joey.
cecilia Joey, well thank you. That is so sweet. Oh, excuse me.
the_writer It wasn't my decision!
cecilia I'm having a conversation here! You were saying?
joey Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye - l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
cecilia All right Joey, I will help you. Not because I-I owe it to this stupid show, but because I owe it to Jessica.
joey Oh that's great! Oh thank you so much!
cecilia You're so welcome.
joey Hey! Now, I've been watching some tapes, how's this? "Jessica Lockhart will never step foot in this place again! Ever!!"
cecilia Is that supposed to be me?
joey Yeah.
cecilia Yeah but Jessica doesn't have an English accent.
joey I can do an English accent?! That baby's going on my resume!
chandler Well, I feel like a snack!
monica Do you want some shortbread? Eh that's Scottish like you are.
chandler Oh no thanks. I don't like any thing from my Scottish heritage.
ross What?!
chandler Well it's just my entire family was run out of Scotland by... Vikings. Anyway, lots of bad memories.
ross Oh well, it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.
monica No! No-no they're not. They're still very angry! But y'know Chandler is also half-Swedish. You know what the Swedish people are famous for? Sitting down and being quiet.
ross Well yeah-yeah the Scottish history is so much more
monica You can not play bagpipes at the wedding!!
ross How did you know about that?!
chandler We heard you play all the way from your apartment!
ross Were you the ones called the cops?!
chandler That's not really important right now. What is important is; while we appreciate the gesture, we just don't feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding.
ross Why not?
chandler Because we hate them.
ross Come on that's not fair! I mean you haven't even heard me play!
chandler We have heard you play.
ross No, you've heard my practice. Okay? Just-just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want. And I'm not going to tell you what song I'm gonna play either. But uh, let's just say when it's over I'll bet there will be a we bit o' celebration.
cecilia So, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence. So, when Jessica enters a room for instance, she owns everything and every person in that room. You try.
joey Okay! All right!
cecilia No, he already knows that he owns everything in the room! He's not finding it out for the first time! So, try it again.
joey Okay. Okay.
cecilia Right. He's not angry at the room either. Try it again, he owns it! He owns the room. It is his. He owns, owns, owns, owns the room! He owns it!! All right, it's a little weird, but it's getting better. Oh well, I'm gonna miss this woman so much. I don't know what I'm going to do! I mean, it's been 20 years of my life.
joey Oh well - Hey-hey! Maybe, maybe uh, maybe this is a good thing. Y'know? It'll-it'll give you a chance to shake things up, play different characters. You're so talented.
cecilia I am. I am, but I don't know you know. An actor of a certain age is not that easy.
joey Hey that's not true! Look at uh, look at Angela Lansb - Angelina Jolie!
cecilia I probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in, but y'know I just got so comfy here! And... Ohh, I turned down some amazing work!
joey Like-like what?
cecilia Well, let's just say if I left 15 years ago, the landscape of Mexican cinema would be very different today!
joey Wow!
cecilia But... Well now, now's a different time for me.
joey Oh hey come on, don't-don't-don't do this! Umm, look let-let me tell you something, okay? Now when I watch you do a scene, I'm thinking, "Boy, she-she is a great actress!" Uh but-but, I am also thinking, "She is hot!"
cecilia You think I'm hot?
joey You own the room. We should probably get-get uh
cecilia Oh yeah-yeah, we should get the... So when Jessica kisses a man, she usually puts umm, both her hands on the man's face.
joey Yeah-yeah, I noticed that! Is that 'cause she's so passionate?
cecilia No! It's because that way the camera only sees her! Do you wanna try it?
joey Yeah! Okay.
cecilia That was good, that was really good. But I-I think your hands maybe a little off, they should be maybe right like
rachel Hey! Hey!
phoebe_and_rachel Who is it?
guy Hi! It's Tom, I'm here to pick up the phone.
phoebe Whoa! Why do you get to answer the door?
rachel Well why shouldn't I?!
phoebe Because it's my apartment!
rachel Well, then I get to give him the cell phone.
phoebe Okay. All right. Good luck explaining all the calls to China.
tom Hi!
phoebe Wow! How long were we arguing for?
rachel You're not the man who left the cell phone.
tom No that's my assistant.
rachel Is-is he coming?
tom Umm, no.
phoebe Could you-could you umm, give us one second?
tom Sure!
rachel We'll be right back sir.
tom Sure.
phoebe Wh-what do we do?
rachel I don't know!
phoebe Can you believe this? We were waiting for a hot guy and then an even hotter one shows up!
rachel I know! What?!
phoebe Hmm, they just don't make 'em like that anymore!
rachel No-no they do but, you just have to wait.
phoebe Rachel, listen - I mean, if you let me have him then I will really owe you one.
rachel All right. All right Phoebe I will let you have him, but you owe me; you owe me big!
phoebe Yeah! You're such a great friend!
rachel Ohh
tom So, which one of you lovely ladies am I going to take to dinner huh?
phoebe Oh that'd be me. Sir. After you.
tom Okay. Okay.
phoebe Nice!
cecilia Well, you certainly own that room.
joey Actually I rent the whole place and, I just got what you meant. Thank you.
rachel Hi.
joey Hey!
rachel Oh my God! Oh my God!! Ohh, Jessica Lockhart!! In my apartment!! I am such a huge fan! I am such a huge fan!
cecilia Well, it's nice to know that you
rachel MONICA!!!! MONICA!!!!
joey That uh, that is my roommate Rachel.
cecilia Oh that explains all the women's underwear.
joey Sure. Yep.
monica Oh my God! It's true!! Oh my God you are so amazing! Oh my God, can I just ask you to do me oh, just one favor?
cecilia Certainly.
monica Would you slap me? Would you slap me right here in the face?!
cecilia I'd love to, but my lawyer said I can't do that anymore.
rachel God. You seem really, really nice.
joey Okay, bye-bye.
rachel I mean n-not-not fake at all like most famous people.
joey All right, here we go.
rachel Okay.
monica Oh wait, just one more thing! One more minute! Umm, you're a stupid bitch.
cecilia I really can't slap you.
rachel You are so beautiful.
monica Nice to meet you! My God you're great!
joey Thanks for stopping by. See ya! I-I am so sorry. I
cecilia Oh no-no-no-no, being adored. I'm used to it, don't worry about it.
joey Oh my God!
cecilia What?
joey They sent me today's script! They never send the script!
cecilia They don't?
joey Well no, I'm just in a coma. This must mean I have lines! Oh
cecilia How does it happen?
joey Ew, you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.
cecilia Ah what?! Jessica hates horses!
joey Yeah well, I'm guessing after this she's not going to be crazy about electricity either.
ross now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt.
rachel I can imagine you in a short plaid skirt and knee socks.
ross Do you wanna start telling secrets?
rachel No!
ross Now umm, remember I'm still learning.
ross One, two, three, four!
ross You know the song! Sing along!
ross So?
monica_and_chandler No!
dina Loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant Fredrick. And the electric fence, inspired.
fredrick Thank you sweetheart.
dina I can't believe she's really gone. Look around you, all of this is ours.
joey I don't think so.
dina Who are you?!
jessica_lockhart What's the matter Dina? Don't you recognize your own mother?!
the_director Cut! That was great everybody! Thank you!
cecilia That was so wonderful! Ohh, I think that you're a better Jessica than I ever was!
joey Oh noo
cecilia Well of course not, but you were very good.
joey Thanks!
cecilia And guess what? Good news! I got another job!
joey Great! Hey! All right! Well-well what is it?!
cecilia A film in Guadalajara!
joey The airport?
cecilia No that's La Guardia. This is Mexico.
joey Ohh. Wow! Well how-how, how will you be gone?
cecilia Eight months.
joey That's a really long time.
cecilia Yeah, but you can come and visit me. I bet that you could uh, own a few places down there.
joey Well I tell ya, I should probably buy a place in the city first. And I just got what you meant again - That is - I tell ya, that is a tricky one!
cecilia That is a tricky one. Well, Joey I really wanna thank you. You've, well you made a very difficult time for me a little less painful.
joey Good luck.
cecilia You too.
ross You know the song! Sing along!
phoebe Eeee!!! Eee!! Eee!!
matthew_perry Eee!!
lisa_kudrow Do it again!
