rachel_green Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left.
monica_geller Oh, I ordered mine first.
chandler_bing Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster...
monica_geller Give it to me.
chandler_bing No.
monica_geller Give it to me.
chandler_bing Ok, you can have it.
monica_geller There you go, enjoy your coffee.
chandler_bing That was there when I got here.
phoebe_buffay Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York.
monica_geller Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow.
phoebe_buffay Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy.
rachel_green You went out with a guy in the Navy?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change.
joey_tribbiani Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?
phoebe_buffay No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay.
rachel_green So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?
monica_geller That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
dr_ross_geller Hiii.
joey_tribbiani Oh no, what happened?
dr_ross_geller Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox.
all@ Oh no.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it.
rachel_green Well I've had it.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I've had it.
monica_geller Had it.
chandler_bing Had it.
phoebe_buffay Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look!
monica_geller Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp.
dr_richard_burke Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown.
dr_richard_burke Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?
monica_geller Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
dr_richard_burke What're you doing?
monica_geller Just waiting for you sweetie.
dr_richard_burke Are you remaking the bed?
monica_geller I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine.
dr_richard_burke Then, you're redoing it because...
monica_geller If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.
dr_richard_burke You're pretty much running that risk either way.
monica_geller Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner.
dr_richard_burke Oh, well that's not so crazy.
monica_geller I'm just easing you in.
dr_richard_burke Oh, alright.
monica_geller Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you.
dr_richard_burke Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.
monica_geller Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.
chandler_bing Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor.
joey_tribbiani But don't you need experience for a job like that?
chandler_bing It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.
scott#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode23 Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections.
chandler_bing Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor.
scott#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode23 No kidding.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.
scott#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode23 Where do you work?
joey_tribbiani Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more.
chandler_bing I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
scott#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode23 Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha...
joey_tribbiani Ha-ha. Are all you processors dorks?
rachel_green Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you.
monica_geller You look fabulous honey, you really do.
phoebe_buffay Yeah? Are you sure, really.
rachel_green You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights.
phoebe_buffay I, I, I'm hideous.
monica_geller It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
phoebe_buffay Come in.
ryan Hey baby, I'm back...
phoebe_buffay Hey Ryan, what's up?
ryan What's goin' on?
phoebe_buffay Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox.
ryan Chicken or small?
phoebe_buffay Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
ryan Why aren't you at home in bed?
phoebe_buffay 'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are.
ryan I'm sorry, I never had 'em.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, ohh.
ryan If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now.
ryan Can I please see your face?
phoebe_buffay Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
ryan Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care.
phoebe_buffay And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary.
ryan Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely.
phoebe_buffay I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.
ryan Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.
phoebe_buffay Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey, how's the first day goin'?
joey_tribbiani Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
chandler_bing Well there you go.
joey_tribbiani Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie.
chandler_bing Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?
chandler_bing Weird world. Your kids?
joey_tribbiani I figure my character has kids.
chandler_bing Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
joey_tribbiani Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does.
chandler_bing Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did.
chandler_bing Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
ryan You know what makes the itching even worse?
phoebe_buffay That you don't stop talking about it.
ryan Fine.
phoebe_buffay Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice...
ryan What're you doing? Are you scratching?
phoebe_buffay No. This is what I do for luck, ok.
ryan You're scratching. Give me the dice.
phoebe_buffay No.
ryan Give me the dice.
phoebe_buffay No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes.
ryan We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar.
phoebe_buffay Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body.
ryan No.
phoebe_buffay Give it.
ryan No.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good.
ryan Oh God help me.
phoebe_buffay Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder.
rachel_green Oh, stop that, stop that right now.
dr_ross_geller You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man.
joey_tribbiani You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it.
jeannie Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.
joey_tribbiani Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie.
jeannie Bye bye Joey.
joey_tribbiani What a phony.
chandler_bing Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas.
joey_tribbiani Sir.
mr_douglas Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?
chandler_bing Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
mr_douglas I have a family, I'm gonna be here.
joey_tribbiani Yeah Bing, what's that about?
chandler_bing It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday.
mr_douglas Rough numbers?
joey_tribbiani This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
mr_douglas Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
chandler_bing Uh, if you say so sir.
joey_tribbiani Joseph's good, isn't he?
chandler_bing Well, I'm going to kill you.
joey_tribbiani Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.
chandler_bing Why?
joey_tribbiani Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say.
dr_richard_burke Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?
monica_geller This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
dr_richard_burke You're strict.
monica_geller It's for their own good.
dr_richard_burke You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.
monica_geller Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.
dr_richard_burke If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.
monica_geller Very good.
dr_richard_burke Thank you.
monica_geller You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
dr_richard_burke You're gonna do what to my clocks.
monica_geller I'm gonna set them to my time.
dr_richard_burke Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time.
monica_geller No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?
dr_richard_burke Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
monica_geller No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now.
dr_richard_burke No come on. Come on tell me.
monica_geller No. See you don't understand.
dr_richard_burke Come on.
monica_geller No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
dr_richard_burke No that's not true. That is not true.
monica_geller Oh yeah.
dr_richard_burke Yeah.
monica_geller Alright, well tell me one of yours.
dr_richard_burke Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.
monica_geller What if they get mixed up?
dr_richard_burke Boy I would just uh, I would freak out.
monica_geller You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.
dr_richard_burke See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well.
joey_tribbiani Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
chandler_bing Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
joey_tribbiani 'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
chandler_bing Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?
joey_tribbiani Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know.
chandler_bing Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go.
joey_tribbiani What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph.
chandler_bing I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up.
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department.
chandler_bing Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife.
joey_tribbiani Karen.
chandler_bing Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did.
joey_tribbiani Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
chandler_bing Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer.
joey_tribbiani Really?
chandler_bing No freakshow, she's fictional.
joey_tribbiani Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else.
chandler_bing Thank you.
joey_tribbiani It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot.
phoebe_buffay Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
rachel_green No sorry hon, Monica's orders.
ryan Well that wasn't easy.
dr_ross_geller Ok, dinner's on.
rachel_green And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
dr_ross_geller Alright you kids, bye now.
phoebe_buffay@ryan Bye.
dr_ross_geller Oh look, a low budget puppet show.
phoebe_buffay It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
ryan Wine?
phoebe_buffay Please.
ryan Oh, I spilled some.
phoebe_buffay I got it.
ryan I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.
phoebe_buffay What?
ryan Sorry. You look beautiful.
phoebe_buffay Oh.
phoebe_buffay You know what, that's it, that's it.
dr_richard_burke Monica, wake up. Monica.
monica_geller What's up?
dr_richard_burke I thought of a thing.
monica_geller Yeah?
dr_richard_burke Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.
monica_geller No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
dr_richard_burke Or so I would have you believe.
monica_geller No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed.
dr_richard_burke Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet.
monica_geller Alright, go on.
dr_richard_burke Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.
monica_geller Oh my God, you're a freak.
dr_richard_burke Yeah. How 'bout that.
rachel_green So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?
ryan I really can't say.
dr_ross_geller So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board?
ryan I can't say.
rachel_green Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys.
ryan I'm sorry, but I can't say.
dr_ross_geller Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines.
ryan I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight.

dr_ross_geller You like that do ya?
rachel_green Oh yeah.
dr_ross_geller I'll make some calls.
rachel_green Ok.
ryan Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
phoebe_buffay I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that.
ryan Taxi.
phoebe_buffay Bye you.
rachel_green Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor.

rachel_green I'll say.
dr_ross_geller I'm shipping out tomorrow.
rachel_green Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light.
dr_ross_geller Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs.
