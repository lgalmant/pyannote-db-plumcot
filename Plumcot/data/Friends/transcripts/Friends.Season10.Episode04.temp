monica Hey guys!
ross_rachel_and_chandler Hey!
chandler Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.
monica That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!
rachel Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!
ross Yeah!
rachel We're having a party.
monica Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?
ross No.
rachel No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!
chandler Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!
ross C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.
monica Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.
chandler There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...
rachel Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?
ross Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.
rachel And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!
monica All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.
chandler Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...
monica Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!
rachel You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.
phoebe Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!
ross Hey guys!
rachel_and_phoebe Hi!
ross Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.
rachel Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.
phoebe Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!
ross Yeah!
phoebe Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!
ross That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?
rachel Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.
ross Ah, and where is Joey?
rachel I said it's still nap time.
ross Hey, there is uncle Joey!
joey Hey!
ross Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!
joey 18, uh? Ross: Joey, NO!
joey What, what!? it's for her hot friends!
ross When they see this you'll be 52!
joey And starting to think about settling down!
rachel Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?
joey I'd love to! Yeah! Joey: We were supposed to bring presents?
phoebe Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.
joey Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?
phoebe Joey, it's a birthday party.
joey Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! Yeah... that's a funny cup!
monica Hey!
chandler Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?
rachel Oh, she's still napping
chandler Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.
rachel Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.
monica All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!
rachel No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.
monica Are you freaking kidding me, Green?
jack_and_judy HI!
ross Hey!
monica So glad you came!
jack I can't believe Emma is already one!
judy I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room! Ross: There's something you didn't know about your dad!
joey Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.
jack Thank you!
joey Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!
jack Which one are you?
monica I can't believe Emma is still asleep!
chandler I know, what are we gonna do?
monica I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!
chandler I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!
joey Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents! Phoebe: So you're gonna... hit on her?
joey No, no, no! My talents as an actor!
phoebe Oh!
joey You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!
phoebe Or you could stick a fork in an apple!
joey Hey, I think Emma might like it!
rachel Oh! Emma might like what?
joey Um, my present!
rachel What did you get her?
joey Actually we prepared performances.
phoebe Separate performances.
joey But equally real!
rachel Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?
phoebe Sure, yeah!
joey O K.
rachel All right, let's get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.
ross Oh, great!
phoebe Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?
joey Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!
rachel So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?
joey I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emma's books.
rachel Oh, ok, which one?
joey Uh, why, it's a... one of her favorites, uh, "Riding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depression" eesh! "Love you forever". Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be". And while he rocked her, he sang "I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be".
rachel Wow! That was amazing!
ross Thank you so much for that gift!
chandler I was not ready for this today!
ross Amazing... amazing.
rachel Oh, Phoebe, I'm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.
phoebe That's right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For there's no greater gift, than the gift of music. Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!
rachel Is that it?
phoebe No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading "Sex and the single mother. Finding your G-spot.
everybody No, no, no, no, no!
judy Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.
jack Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.
judy Yes, you'll be all grown up by then. We'll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.
jack That's true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!
judy After all, my parents died very young.
jack And my cholesterol's off the charts!
judy Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!
ross Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!
rachel Ross, um, don't forget to get a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.
ross Sure.
rachel Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corino's.
monica Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.
rachel Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!
monica Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?
rachel Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.
ross Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?
rachel Ross, what are you talking about? oh! Oh my God! They put my baby's face on a penis!
phoebe oh! Now it's a party!
rachel Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!
joey Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?
judy Jack, look at this.
jack I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!
ross I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.
rachel No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughter's birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!
ross Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. That is a weird sentence!
rachel Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... Joey, don't touch it!!
joey I'm so confused!
rachel Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!
chandler To be fair this one does have nuts.
ross Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.
monica Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!
ross Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? Ok!
chandler Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?
monica We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!
chandler We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday.
monica Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.
phoebe And you know, I have a massage client soon.
ross You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?
monica Alright, 5 more minutes.
ross Hello? Oh no! What happened? Ok ok, where are you? Ok, I'll be right there.
chandler Was that Emma? Is she up?
ross No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.
phoebe Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.
monica No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us We've been complaining the longest!
ross No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?
chandler I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!
ross Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves!
joey Got it! Hey hey hey! Where do you think you're going?
chandler To the bathroom!
joey Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li... Wait a minute, there is a window in there!
phoebe Oh no! He's not getting away that easy!
chandler What are you doing? Get the hell out of here!
joey Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.
phoebe No, it did not.
joey No.
judy Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.
jack Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.
judy Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.
joey Ok!
judy Bye... Bye dear.
joey Nighty-night!
judy Nighty-night!
joey Bye, bye.
phoebe Joey? How could you just let them leave?
joey Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.
monica No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.
joey Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in.
chandler You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?
joey Oh! I forgot you used to live here!
joey Hello?
estelle Joey! It's Estelle!
joey Hey!
estelle So, how did your audition go today?
joey What audition?
estelle The one I told you about last week?
joey What? You never said anything about an audition!
estelle Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.
joey A monologue? I don't have.. I got it. Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!
phoebe Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!
monica Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!
phoebe Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!
monica No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.
joey Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.
monica Ok, ten.
joey Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?
phoebe No, lets just draw straws.
joey Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..
chandler I'm begging you stop.
joey Right.
monica Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!
phoebe Yeah!! Let's do that!
chandler That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!
monica Everybody get your toys!
phoebe Ok! I want the dolphin!
chandler Thats a bear.
phoebe I'm too excited!
monica Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!
joey Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys!
chandler Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!
phoebe Go! Go!
joey Come on robot!
monica What are you barking at?
monica Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?
chandler I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?
joey Way to go robot!
phoebe Good job Alan!
joey Hey, good race you guys.
phoebe Yeah, see you later!
monica No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...
chandler They left.
rachel No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. Bye...
ross RACHEL!
rachel OOH! God! Sorry!
ross I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.
rachel Emma's awake.
ross Yeah?
rachel I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.
ross Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else.
rachel Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.
ross Rach, she's not going to remember this.
rachel I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! They have to learn!
ross Hey!
rachel What?
ross It's not bad.
rachel Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?
ross Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.
rachel Well, I'm very impressed.
ross Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
monica Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.
chandler I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?
monica Game?
chandler Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.
chandler Ooh! That's my girl!
monica That's how old you are.
chandler Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?
monica Ooh, I want one...
chandler Me too...
chandler There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?
monica ..and head to Canada!
chandler I was kidding.
monica I wasn't. Let's get going!
phoebe Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?
chandler No, not yet.
phoebe Oh good, I didn't miss the party.
monica What about your massage client?
phoebe I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.
joey Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!
joey I've been here the whole time!
ross Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.
rachel I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!
chandler Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.
rachel What?
chandler Emma, how old are you? How old are you today?
emma Wo-ish.
rachel Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!
ross Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...
rachel NO, no science camp!
ross Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.
rachel Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!
monica Thanks!
ross Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.
chandler Let's do it, come on!
ross What's wrong? Are you okay?
rachel Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.
phoebe Hey, you made it into a bunny.
joey What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
rachel Okay.
ross Okay, you ready?
rachel Yeah.
ross A-a-and... record.
rachel Okay. Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...
phoebe Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
