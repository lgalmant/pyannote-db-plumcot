monica Do you realize this is probably the last time we'll all be here in the coffee house as six single people?
phoebe Why?! What's happening to the coffee house?! Oh!
chandler Yep! From now on its gonna be the four of you guys and me and the misses. The little woman. The wife. The old ball and chain.

joey No, I-I just heard lunch. But yeah, I can go. Sure!
ross Y'know what? Actually I'm kinda glad they're leaving 'cause uh, I need to talk to you about something.
chandler What's up?
ross Well this uh, this may be a little awkward.
chandler Listen, if you want to borrow money, its kind of a bad time. I'm buying dinner for 128 people tomorrow night.
ross No, its...Its not that. Umm, now what I'm going to say to you, I'm not saying as your friend. Okay? I'm-I'm saying as it as Monica's older brother.
chandler But you're still my friend?
ross Not for the next few minutes.
chandler During this time...are you, are you still my best man?
ross Nope.
chandler Do I still call you Ross?
ross Okay! You guys are getting married tomorrow and-and I couldn't be more thrilled for both of you, but as Monica's older brother I-I have to tell you this. If you ever hurt my little sister, if you ever cause her any unhappiness of any kind, I will hunt you down, and kick your ass! What? I'm-I'm-I'm serious! Come-Hey! Dude! Stop it! Okay? I'm-I'm not kidding here!
chandler Hey, I hear what your saying, okay? And, thanks for the warning.
ross No problem.
chandler So are we...friends again?
ross Yeah.
chandler Okay. You won't believe what Monica's older brother just said to me!
rachel What 'cha doing Mon?
monica I'm making a list of all the things that are most likely to go wrong at the wedding. Now, that way I can be prepared.
phoebe What are they?
monica Well, so far I have uh, my bride's maids dresses won't get picked up, my veil gets lost, or I don't have my something blue.
rachel Hey! Those are all the things I'm responsible for!
monica I had to go with the odds Rach.

richard No, we still have food in the basement! I saw potatoes and some dry pasta!
the_director Hang on a minute! Joey, you keep touching your face. Is something wrong?
joey No. Nope, I uh...I th-I thought it might be kind of a cool character thing. Y'know? He's uh, he's a face toucher.
the_director I don't think so. Let's take it back to Richard's last line. Action!
richard We may not have any weapons, but we still have food. In the basement I saw potatoes and some dry pasta, and a few tins of tuna!
monica Honey, we gotta go!
chandler Okay. Here's a question you never have to ask. My dad just called and wanted to know if he could borrow one of your pearl necklaces.
monica I don't have anything like that, but let me go see if Rachel does.
chandler Yes, include more people in this.
monica Hey, do you realize that at this time tomorrow we'll be getting married?

mr_bing Yes! Although, I think we may be seeing a little too much of some people. Aren't you a little old to be wearing a dress like that?
mrs_bing Don't you have a little too much penis to be wearing a dress like that?
chandler Oh my God!
mr_geller ...of course you can kick his ass son.
mrs_geller You could kick anyone's ass you want too.
ross Thanks you guys.
monica Oh, Rach! Rach! Umm hey, could you do me a favor and would talk to Chandler's dad and try to keep him away from Chandler's mom?
rachel Yeah! But I don't know what he looks like!

mr_geller Doctor Ross Geller.
ross Dad...dad, please! As I was saying umm, I'm Dr. Ross Geller. Uhh, and I'm the best man.

So if you'd all please join me in raising a glass to the, the couple we're here to celebrate. To the Bings.

monica All right, I'm gonna go steam my wedding dress okay? Who wants the responsibility of making sure nothing happens to it?
rachel I'll do it.
monica Who wants it? Anybody?
rachel I said I'll do it!
monica Nobody wants to do it? All right, I'll do it myself.
rachel Monica! I'm not gonna screw it up!
monica Y'know what? You're right, I'm sorry. Actually you were a big help tonight. Yeah, and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab and making sure she got to the hotel safely.
rachel Well of course that is what I'm here for!
monica Okay. Sorry.
rachel Ugh! What grandmother?
joey Hey! Where have you been?
ross Oh, taking my parents back to the hotel.
joey Oh.
ross What? Are you going back to work?
joey Yeah.
ross Nice shades.
joey Thanks. Yeah, I figure if I wear these in my scenes at least I won't get spit in the eyes, y'know?
ross And if I remember correctly, Ray Ban was the official sponsor of World War I!
joey Great! All right. I'll see you later.
ross Hey, where's Chandler?
joey Uh, I think he's in Rachel's room. See ya.
ross Chandler? Chandler?
ross Hey!
rachel Hi!
ross Is uh, is Monica here?
rachel She's steaming her dress, why? What's up?
ross I think Chandler's gone.
rachel What?!
ross He left that.
rachel Tell Monica I'm sorry.
phoebe What's up? Tell Monica I'm sorry. Tell her yourself!
phoebe Oh my God! Chandler just left though!
rachel Yeah but, maybe it's not what we think. Maybe it's tell Monica I'm sorry I...drank the last of the milk.
phoebe Or maybe he-he was writing to tell her that-that he's changed his name, y'know? Tell Monica I'm sorry.
ross I think it means he freaked out and left!
phoebe Don't be so negative! Good God! Isn't it possible that Sorry is sitting in there right now?!
rachel Okay. Phoebe, I-I think Ross is right. What are we gonna do?
ross Look-Okay, I'm just gonna-I'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back! Okay? You-you make sure Monica does not find out, okay?
rachel Okay.
phoebe Okay but if you don't find him and bring him back, I am gonna hunt you down and kick your ass!
ross I will, I will find him.
richard Hey Joey, could you uh, go through these lines with me?
joey Oh man! They-they just redid my make-up!
richard Just the last two pages.
joey All right.
richard I found the picture!
joey Picture? What picture?
richard Could you uh, could you lower your script? I need to see your face so I can uh, play off your reaction.
joey Okay uh, look I know you're a great actor, okay? And you play all those Shakespeare guys and stuff
richard Oh, thanks.
joey But you're spittin' all over me man!
richard Well of course I am!
joey You know you've been spitting on me?!
richard That's what real actors do! Annunciation is the mark of a good actor! And when you enunciate, you spit!
joey Wow! Didn't know that.
richard Great!
joey Thanks! Okay-okay check it out! Picture? What picture? Eh?
ross Gunther have you uh, have you seen Chandler?

gunther I wasn't invited.
ross Well then we'll-we'll see you the day after tomorrow. Mom?! Dad?! What-what...what you guys doing here?!
mr_geller Well you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what all the fuss is about.
mrs_geller I certainly see what the girls like coming here.
ross Why?!
mrs_geller The sexy blonde behind the counter.
ross Gunther?!
mr_geller Your mother just added him to her list.
ross What? Your-your list?
mrs_geller Yeah, the list that-of people we're allowed to sleep
ross Yes! No-no! I know, I know what the list is! Mom! Look if you see Chandler, could you just let him know I'm looking for him?
mr_geller And if you see Rita Moreno, let her know I'm looking for her.
the_director Action!
richard I found the picture!
joey What picture?!
richard The picture of my wife! In your pack!
joey You went through my personal property?
richard Why do have a picture of Paulette in your pack?!
joey Because Vincent, we were lovers. For two years!
the_director Cut! Wonderful!
joey Great scene yeah?
richard Oh you're awesome! And, in that last speech? You soaked me.
joey Thanks a lot.
the_assistant_director Here's your call sheet for tomorrow.
joey Oh, I'm-I'm not working tomorrow.
the_assistant_director You are now.
joey No! No! I can't! You gotta get me out of it! I've got plans! Important plans!
rachel Ross said there's still no word from Chandler.
phoebe Oh man.
rachel Oh but he did say that they found the grandmother wandering down fifth avenue.
phoebe Okay. Well there's one down.
monica I'm getting married today!!! I think I just cracked a rib. But I don't care because today's my wedding day! My day is finally here!!
phoebe Y'know she might not even notice he's gone.
monica I'm gonna start getting ready!
rachel God! Don't-We can't let her start getting ready! This is too awful! Oh God, but wait she'll be in the gown and then he won't show up and then she's gonna have to take off the gown
phoebe Shhh! Stop it! Stop it Rachel! You can't do this here!
rachel I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just...It's just so sad!
phoebe Yeah, but you've got to pull yourself together! Monica can't see you like this! Then she'll know something's wrong!
rachel I know. I know. Oh God. There's no tissue! Can you grab me some toilet paper?
phoebe Yeah. Oh, that's gone too. This is Monica's bathroom right?!
rachel Oh!
phoebe No-no! I-I...I found one.
rachel Okay.
rachel Oh thank you! Oh God! Can I have another one?
phoebe Sure. Do you need some floss?
rachel Oh God I just can not imagine what is gonna happen if Chandler doesn't show up!
phoebe Oh here's a whole bunch.
rachel Oh, I mean she's gonna be at the wedding waiting for him and people will be whispering, "Oh that poor girl." Y'know? Then she'll have to come back here and live all alone.
phoebe Oh my God!
rachel What?
phoebe There was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive. Monica's pregnant. So I guess she won't be totally alone.
rachel Oh my God!
phoebe I know! Monica's gonna have a baby! Hey, can this count as her something new?
rachel Oh my God!
phoebe Hey, do you think this is why Chandler took off?
rachel No, she had to have just taken that test because I took out the trash last night.
phoebe Oh God, this is turning into the worst wedding day ever! The bride is pregnant. The groom is missing. And I'm still holding this.
rachel Okay Phoebe, we can not tell anyone about this.
phoebe Right.
rachel Okay?
phoebe Yeah, okay. Hey, wait. Do you know what kind of birth control she was using?
rachel No. Why?
phoebe Just for the future, this is hardly a commercial for it.
rachel Anything?
ross No! I talked to Joey on the set, he hasn't heard from him. I-I-I talked to Chandler's parents again!
phoebe You told them he was missing?
ross No! I made it seem like I was just calling to chat. Pretty sure, they both think I'm interested in them.
rachel All right, we've got to tell her he's gone.
ross No! Hey! Hey! We can't!
rachel Ross, she's gonna start getting ready soon!
ross Well, can't you at least stall her a little? I'll-I'll go back to some of the places I went last night.
rachel All right, well how much time do you need?
ross Well how much time before she absolutely has to start getting ready?
rachel One hour.
ross Give me two.
rachel Then why do you ask?!
ross Okay, wish me luck.
phoebe Okay. I'm going with you.
ross Why?!
phoebe Ross, you're tired. You've been looking all night. And clearly you suck at this.
rachel All right, I'll see you guys later.
phoebe Okay. Wait, do you know how you're going to stall her?
rachel I'll figure something out.
phoebe All right. Good luck.
rachel Thanks.
monica Hey! Okay, so I thought we'd start with my make up and then do my hair.
rachel Okay uh, but before you do that. I-I, I need you to talk to me.
monica About what?
rachel Umm... I'm never gonna getting married!
monica Yeah you will! The right guy is just around the corner! Okay, are we done with that?
rachel No Monica! I'm serious! Oh, maybe I should just forget about it. Become a lesbian or something.
monica Any woman would be lucky to have ya.
rachel Well maybe it would make me feel better if I slept with Joey.
monica Rachel! You okay?
joey Excuse me, Aaron? Hi! Umm, I have a little problem with the schedules. Originally, I wasn't supposed to work today, and I have this wedding that I really have to be at. It's my best friend's, and I'm officiating so I really can't work past four.
the_director Joey, you gotta stay until the end. We can't stop filming just for you. It's not like it's your wedding.
joey I'm having surgery!
the_director What?!
joey Yeah, I-I just made up the stuff about the wedding because I didn't want you to worry about me. But, I'm having surgery today.
the_director What kind of surgery?!
joey Transplant.
the_director But you're supposed to work on Monday.
joey Hair transplant.
the_director But you're not bald.
joey It's not on my head.
the_director Look Joey, there's nothing I can do. Besides, you're probably gonna be out by four anyway. We've just got one short scene. It's just you and Richard, and God knows he's a pro. You'll be fine. Morning Richard.
joey Hey! You're here! Great! Great! Great! Let's get going buddy, we've got a scene to shoot!
richard I'm wearing two belts.
joey Are you drunk?
richard No!
joey Yes you are!
richard All right.
ross We are never gonna find him! He's one guy in a huge city!
phoebe Oh my God! Is that him?
ross That is an old, Chinese woman!
phoebe He could be in disguise, y'know.
ross Aw, y'know...Y'know, maybe we're-we're just approaching this all wrong. If you're Chandler and-and you wanna hide, where is the last place on Earth people would think you'd go?
ross So this is your office?
chandler How did you guys find me? I knew I should've hid at the gym!
phoebe What the hell are you doing?!
chandler Panicking! And using the Internet to try to prove that I'm related to Monica. How is she?
ross She's fine. She doesn't know you're gone. And she doesn't have to know, okay? Now come on, we're going home.
chandler No! No! No! I can't do that!
phoebe Why not?!
chandler Because if I go home, we're gonna become the Bings! I can't be the Bings!
ross What's wrong with being the Bings?
chandler The Bings have horrible marriages! They yell. They fight. And they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games!
ross Chandler, have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room?
chandler No.
ross Then you are neither of your parents!
chandler It's not just their marriage! I mean, look at yours. Look at everybody's! The only person that can make marriage work is Paul Newman! And I've met me; I am not Paul Newman. I don't race cars! I don't make popcorn! None of my proceeds go to charity.
phoebe But look Chandler, right now, no one has a lower opinion of you than I do. But I totally believe you can do this.
chandler I want to. I love her so much, but I'm afr...It's too huge.
ross Y'know, okay. You're right. It is huge. So why don't we take it just a little bit at a time? Okay? Umm, forget getting married for a sec; just forget about it. Can you just come home and take a shower?
chandler Well yeah, but then
ross Yeah-No-but-but-but-but! We're just gonna go home and take a shower. Now, that's not scary right?
chandler Depends on what you mean by we.
rachel The nights are the hardest. But then the day comes! And that's every bit as hard as the night. And then the night comes again
monica The days and nights are hard! I get it! Okay? Look umm, Rachel I'm sorry! I have to start getting ready! I'm getting married today!
rachel I know. At dusk. That's such a hard time for me.
monica I'm gonna go put my make up on, we have to be at the hotel in an hour!
rachel Okay. But wait!
monica What?!
rachel Let's go to lunch.
monica I can't go to lunch!!
rachel Right.
rachel Oh good God! I've fallen down!
monica What's going on?
rachel Okay. All right. Honey listen. When I tell you what I'm about to tell you, I need you to remember that we are all here for you and that we love you.
monica Okay, you're-you're really freaking me out.
rachel We can't find Chandler...-'s vest. We can't find Chandler's vest.
monica How can that be?! Oh wait! Wait! Are you, are you serious?!
phoebe Found the vest! I mean we're gonna have to keep an eye on it, y'know make sure we don't lose it again
rachel Oh!
monica Oh wow! Okay. Don't scare me like that okay? I mean for a minute there I was like, "Oh my God! The worst has happened!"
joey I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
richard That can be arranged.
the_director Let's reset.
joey What?! He got me! Owwwwww!!!
the_director Let's take it from there.
richard Are you a little off today? It's going terribly slowly.
joey Look, my best friends are getting married in like an hour. Okay? And I'm the minister. Please! Please! Can you pull it together?
richard Of course! I'm-I'm sorry. I-I'd hate you to miss anything like that on account of me. I can do this!
joey Thank you. Thank you.
the_director Still rolling, annnnd action!
joey I would sooner die in this hellhole then see her back with you!
richard Now, that can be arranged! Slippery little bugger!
phoebe So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?
mrs_geller Here comes the bride.
phoebe Oh my God Monica!
monica I wanna wear this everyday.
rachel You look so beautiful.
monica I'm so happy for me.
rachel Hello?
joey Hey! Did Chandler show up yet?
rachel Yeah, we got him back. Everything's fine.
joey Damnit!
rachel What? Why? Where are you?
joey I'm still on the set!
rachel Joey! The wedding is in less than an hour!
joey I know! I'm sorry! The guy's drunk, they won't let me go until we get this.
rachel Oh my God! I'm gonna have to find another minister.
joey No! No, I'm the minister! All right, look-look, put 'em both on the phone, I'll marry them right now.
rachel Ugh! Joey, I have to go.
joey Hey! Don't you hang up on me! I'll marry you and me right now! I have the power!
ross There you go. You put on a tuxedo! Now that wasn't so scary, was it?
chandler No.
ross I'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.
chandler Yeah okay. Well, what's the next little bit?
ross Getting married. Okay. Okay. You can, you can do that too! Just like you've done everything else!
chandler Yeah. You're right. Hey I-I can do that.
ross Yeah.
chandler Okay, excuse me for a minute.
ross Wh-Hey-Whoa-whoa, where, where you going?!
chandler Ross, I am not gonna run away again! I just want to get a little fresh air.
ross Okay.
chandler Okay.
chandler Oh fresh air!
phoebe Wait! Maybe, maybe you're overreacting! You do that y'know.
rachel Well Phoebe, we gotta do something! Well, y'know. I mean there's no way Joey's gonna make it in time. So I'm gonna through the hotel and see if there's any other weddings going on.
phoebe Okay. Oh but don't tell them Monica's pregnant because, they frown on that.
rachel Okay.
phoebe Okay.
rachel Anastassakis/Papasifakis wedding, excellent! {It's a good thing Jennifer Aniston is Greek, because she had to pronounce those names. Luckily for me, they were written on a sign.} Congratulations. Mazel Tov! Hi! Oh, great hat. Listen umm, I need you to perform another wedding. Can you do that?
the_rabbi I don't know. Are they Greek Orthodox?
rachel Yeah! Yeah. They're...they're-they're my friends, uh, Monica Stephanopolus and uh, and Chandler Acidofolus.
ross Hi! Hi! Hi. Has umm, anyone seen Chandler?
mr_geller I thought he was with you.
ross He-he was with me umm, we're playing a little game, y'know? Hide and seek.
mr_geller You can't ask us son, that's cheating.
ross You're right, thanks for keeping me honest dad.
mrs_geller Well, he better not come by here. He can't see the bride in the wedding dress.
mrs_bing As I recall when we got married, I saw the groom in the wedding dress.
mr_bing But that was after the wedding, it's not bad luck then.
mrs_bing Honey, it isn't good luck.
ross Oh my God! Monica!
monica I know! Hey, how's Chandler doin'?
ross Great. He's doing great. Don't you worry about Chandler.
monica Are you okay?
ross Uh-huh.
monica Well, you're-you're sweating.
ross These-these are beads of joy.
monica Oh that's sweet. Don't touch me.
ross Uh Phoebe, can I see you for a second?
phoebe Yeah!
phoebe What's going on?
ross Chandler's gone again!
phoebe Oh my God! Why would you play hide and seek with someone you know is a flight risk?!
joey Aaron! You gotta let me go. The guy's hammered!
the_director I'm sorry Joey, as long as he's here and he's conscious we're still shooting.
richard You wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?
joey So I uh, I just talked to the director. That's it, we're done for the day.
richard Well have we finished the scene?
joey Yeah! You...you were wonderful.
richard As were you.
joey So I got your car, it's right outside.
richard Why? Are we done for the day?
joey That's what you told me.
richard Oh, thank you. You're welcome.
joey No-no-no! We gotta go! Come on! Here we go.
richard Is that my ass?
ross There he is!!
chandler What?
phoebe Hey! Oh!

ross Then where the hell have you been?!
chandler I know about Monica.
phoebe You know?!

chandler Well I was! Then I went down to the gift shop because I was out of cigarettes
phoebe_and_ross Cigarettes?!!
chandler Big picture please! So I was in the gift shop, and that's when I uh, saw this. Yeah, y'know what? I thought anything that can fit into this, can't be scary.
phoebe Well you obviously didn't see Chucky 3.
chandler But come on, look at how cute and small this is! So I got it to give Monica so she'd know I was okay.
ross Dude.
mr_geller Way to go son! I knew you'd find him!
mr_bing Our little boy is getting married.
mrs_bing Oh look at you! So handsome!
chandler You look beautiful mom. You look beautiful too dad. I love you both. I'm so glad you here.
the_rabbi Are you Chandler?
chandler Are you Joey?
ross Huh. This is nice.
phoebe What?
ross I've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.
mrs_geller Oh I wish you're grandmother had lived to see this.
monica She's right there.
mrs_geller Not that old crow, my mother. Congratulations darling.
mr_geller I love you sweetheart.
chandler You look beautiful. Is this new?
monica Not now.
chandler Okay.
monica Who is this?
the_rabbi I am Father Kalebasous.
chandler He's Greek Orthodox.
rachel As are you
the_rabbi Let us begin. Dearly beloved
joey That's my line! I can take it from here, thanks. Dearly beloved, I'm sorry I'm a little late. You may be confused by this now, but you won't be Memorial Day weekend 2002. Well, let's get started before the groom takes off again. Huh? We are gathered here today, to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony. I've known Monica and Chandler for a long time, and I can not imagine two people more perfect for each other. And now, as I've left my notes in my dressing room. We shall proceed to the vows. Monica?
monica He took off?
rachel Go on! Go on.
monica Chandler, for so long I...I wondered if I would ever find my prince, my soul mate. Then three years ago, at another wedding I turned to a friend for comfort. And in stead, I found everything that I'd ever been looking for my whole life. And now...here we are...with our future before us...and I only want to spend it with you, my prince, my soul mate, my friend. Unless you don't want to. You go!
joey Chandler?
chandler No, that's okay. Monica I thought this was going to be the most difficult thing I ever gonna had to do. But when I saw you walking down that aisle I realized how simple it was. I love you. Any surprises that come our way it's okay, because I will always love you. You are the person I was meant to spend the rest of my life with. You wanna know if I'm sure?
joey You may not kiss the bride. So, I guess by the powers vested in my by the state of New York and the Internet guys, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Oh wait! Do you take each other?
chandler I do.
monica I do.
joey Yeah you do!
ross Rings?
joey Aw crap! Okay-uh...uh let's-let's do the rings.
joey We good? Yeah? Good? Once again, I pronounce you husband and wife. Now kiss her again.
chandler I love you. And I know about the baby.
monica What baby?
chandler Our baby.
monica We have a baby?
chandler Phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash.
monica I didn't take a pregnancy test.
chandler Then...who did?
phoebe Oh and they're gonna have a baby.
rachel Uh-huh.
