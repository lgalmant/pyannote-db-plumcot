dr_ross_geller Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?
phoebe_buffay What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
rachel_green That's not the end.
phoebe_buffay Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
monica_geller What about the part where he has rabies?
phoebe_buffay He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said.
dr_richard_burke Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen.
phoebe_buffay What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.
monica_geller Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.
joey_tribbiani Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over.
monica_geller Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.
chandler_bing Well, how do you find clothes that fit?
joey_tribbiani Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question.
monica_geller Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look.
joey_tribbiani No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket.
chandler_bing Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking. 'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'
monica_geller Ok. Hey, why don't you ask Richard?
joey_tribbiani Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?
dr_richard_burke Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.
chandler_bing Ok, that's Eric.
dr_richard_burke Glad to be of help. Matches.
monica_geller I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?
joey_tribbiani I don't know.
monica_geller C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
chandler_bing I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings.
monica_geller So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.
joey_tribbiani How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
chandler_bing Ok, this could be tough.
joey_tribbiani Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.
chandler_bing Ooh, you almost had it.
dr_ross_geller No no, you're fine, you're fine.

susan_bunch You can watch our tape if you want.
dr_ross_geller I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?

monica_geller So'd you guys have fun?
chandler_bing Your boyfriend is so cool.
monica_geller Really?
chandler_bing Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15.
rachel_green Wow, he must like you the best.

joey_tribbiani Ok. He kept my dollar.
monica_geller So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?
carol_willick Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg.
susan_bunch Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there.
dr_ross_geller Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg.
carol_willick Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
dr_ross_geller Buy mommy.
carol_willick@susan_bunch We love you. Buy.
dr_ross_geller Have a good time. Ok, Ben.
monica_geller Ross.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
monica_geller Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here?
joey_tribbiani How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
dr_ross_geller Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.
monica_geller You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard.
joey_tribbiani Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him.
dr_ross_geller Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
chandler_bing Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know.
monica_geller So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?
joey_tribbiani Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine.
chandler_bing Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs.
monica_geller You're meeting Richard?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game.
chandler_bing Yeah, didn't he tell ya?
monica_geller Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys.
chandler_bing You hear that? We're the guys.
joey_tribbiani We're the guys.
monica_geller With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
dr_ross_geller Thank you.
dr_ross_geller Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try.
rachel_green No luck huh?
dr_ross_geller Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off.
rachel_green Oh, yeah sure, Ok.
dr_ross_geller What're you doing?
rachel_green Uh, I'm holding Ben.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, well, he's a baby not a bomb.
rachel_green Ok.
dr_ross_geller Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
rachel_green This is how I would hold a football.
dr_ross_geller Ok, here, here. There we go.
rachel_green Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one.
dr_ross_geller It's alright, it's no big deal.
rachel_green Really?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby.
rachel_green What?
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green You think about stuff like that?
dr_ross_geller Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies.
rachel_green Two, two babies?
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive.
rachel_green Then what's gonna happen?
dr_ross_geller Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale.
rachel_green Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great.
rachel_green Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what.
dr_ross_geller Huh?
rachel_green I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door?
phoebe_buffay Hey.
dr_richard_burke Hey Phoebs, what's happening?
phoebe_buffay Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.
monica_geller So you watched the movies huh?
phoebe_buffay Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies.
dr_richard_burke Charlotte who?
phoebe_buffay With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud.
monica_geller Alright, you wanna feel better?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.
monica_geller Ok, here, watch this.
monica_geller So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in.
phoebe_buffay Please, I almost fell for that with, uh,
dr_richard_burke Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?
phoebe_buffay Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity.
chandler_bing Hey, big guy, game time.
dr_richard_burke Hey, be right there.
monica_geller There's a game?
chandler_bing Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel.
dr_richard_burke It's the basketball playoffs.
monica_geller Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other.
dr_richard_burke Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just died shoveling snow?'
monica_geller Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks.
dr_richard_burke Uh, it's the college playoffs.
monica_geller Oh, then go Vassar.
dr_richard_burke Uh, they're not in it.
monica_geller Ok, then just go.
dr_richard_burke Ok.
monica_geller Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them.
phoebe_buffay Sure.
monica_geller It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?
phoebe_buffay Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
rachel_green Aghh.
phoebe_buffay Me too.
monica_geller I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
rachel_green Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century.
monica_geller Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles.
dr_ross_geller Ok, what the hell happened back there?
rachel_green I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes.
dr_ross_geller Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.
rachel_green Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks.
dr_ross_geller C'mon, what, you never think about our future?
rachel_green Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be.
dr_ross_geller No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good.
rachel_green What was the book?
dr_ross_geller The big book of childrens' names.
rachel_green Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that.
dr_ross_geller Ok fine.
rachel_green Thank you.
dr_ross_geller We're not done.
rachel_green I didn't know that.
dr_ross_geller Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that.
rachel_green Fine, I will.
dr_ross_geller Good, 'cause I love you.
rachel_green Oh yeah.
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
rachel_green Well I love you too.
dr_ross_geller Well that's the first time we've said that.
rachel_green Yes it is.
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm gonna kiss you.
rachel_green Well you better.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
monica_geller Did you like it?
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed.
monica_geller Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?
phoebe_buffay I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, "It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."
chandler_bing Kick save and... denied.
dr_richard_burke But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier?
joey_tribbiani Man you are incredible.
dr_richard_burke Well, we had a table in college.
chandler_bing Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's.
dr_richard_burke Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
monica_geller Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table.
dr_richard_burke Ok, just one more point.
monica_geller Score! Now can we go?
chandler_bing See, that's why we don't let her play.
dr_richard_burke Is everything all right?
monica_geller Um-hmm.
dr_richard_burke Uh-oh.
chandler_bing Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with.
dr_richard_burke Well.
joey_tribbiani No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here.
dr_richard_burke Uh, you guys see me as a dad?
joey_tribbiani Oh yeah.
chandler_bing No.
joey_tribbiani Nooooo.
chandler_bing Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal.
dr_richard_burke Uh-huh, yeah.
chandler_bing No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work.
dr_richard_burke That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around.
monica_geller Nighty-nite.
chandler_bing You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
joey_tribbiani Not a dad.
chandler_bing I can't believe you got us into trouble.
monica_geller So are you ok?
dr_richard_burke Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys.
monica_geller Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.
dr_richard_burke What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em.
monica_geller Yeah, well they suck too.
dr_ross_geller Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail.
rachel_green Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.
dr_ross_geller Hello.
carol_willick It's us.
dr_ross_geller Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together.
rachel_green Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi.

But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go.
