monica Okay, great!  Bye. So guess who's coming to Thanksgiving dinner?
chandler Sydney Portier? Hehheh.
monica I miss Rachel. No, my parents.
chandler Oh! That's great, they haven't seen the place since I moved in!
monica Yeah, and y'know, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! , I was thinking we would eat around four.
chandler Why can't I tell them that we live together?
monica Because they don't know we're dating. Do you think we should eat in the kitchen?
chandler Why haven't you told them?!
monica Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didn't.
chandler Why haven't you told them?! Wouldn't they be happy?!
monica So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! I'll see you then.
chandler Why wouldn't they be happy?
monica Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.
chandler What? What? Why?!
monica Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.
chandler Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?
monica Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.
chandler Y'know, it'll be okay. It'll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then we'll tell 'em.
monica You really think that'll work?
chandler Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didn't I?
monica I don't think you'll ever get my parents that drunk!
chandler Hey! Oh, good, Ross! You're parents like me, right?
ross Yes, of course they like you!
chandler Well Monica just told me that they don't.
ross Yeah, they don't like you.
chandler Do you know why?
ross I dunno, maybe it's because you're really sarcastic. Or maybe it's cause you uh-
chandler Well if people don't know they shouldn't just guess!
chandler This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.
joey Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttin' up, eh?
chandler Maybe I could give thanks by taking my Playstation over to my new apartment.
joey Well maybe I love ya'.
chandler .
janine_to_chandler Hey.
chandler Hey.
janine Hey guys!
ross No I don't want to play video games, Joey!
janine Are you guys going to Chandler's for Thanksgiving?
joey Yeah! Yeah, why? What's up?
janine Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.
ross For real?
janine No, but you should go to Chandler's. Because none of us knows how to cook, we'll probably just end up drinking all day.
joey Ye-ye, we go to yours!
ross Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because it's my sister. But, uh, uh y'know actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.
janine Okay.
joey How you got three women to marry you, I'll never know.
phoebe Hey!
all Hey!
rachel Hey! Hey, Pheebs, check it out. Yeah, for my desert, I have chosen to make a traditional English truffle!
phoebe Wow, that sounds great! And what are you making Monica, in case Rachel's dessert is... so good that I eat all of it. There's none left for anybody else!
monica Nothing.
rachel Nothing?
monica No, sweetie, I-I trust you.
rachel So, if-if I mess this up, there's nothing else for dessert?
monica You're not gonna mess it up.
rachel Wow, Monica, I love that, you really have faith in me. Thank you. Technical question, how do you know when uh, the butter's done?
monica Well, it's done about two minutes before it looks like that.
joey_and_ross Hey!
all Hey!
joey Oh, ooh the food smells great, Mon!
ross And the place looks so nice!
joey Yeah, hey hey, Happy Thanksgiving everybody!
ross Happy Thanksgiving!
the_girls Happy Thanksgiving!
joey Well, this has been great!
ross See ya!
monica Whoa whoa whoa! Where're you goin'?
ross Oh, oh, we did say we'd stop by this little thing Joey's roommate is having.
monica Oh, Janine, the really hot dancer girl?
ross Some would say she's attractive, yes.
phoebe And who else is going to be there?
joey Uh, some of her friends, yeah.
rachel Her dancer friends?
joey Yes, all right? All of her hot dancer friends are gonna be there and they're gonna be, be drinkin' and dancin, and we really wanna go!
ross Dude, we were good!
monica You're not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and you're gonna eat here!
phoebe Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.
ross Oh, but-but it is, uh, it's just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.
joey Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!
mrs_geller Hello everybody!
mr_geller Hi!
all Hi!
monica Dad , Mom . Look! Look who it is it's Chandler!
mrs_geller Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.
chandler Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!
chandler Whoa, snowing out there?
mr_geller No.
mr_geller Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.
mr_geller Ok, I have dandruff. There's no need to laugh and point.
monica Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.
mr_geller My joke wasn't funny.
phoebe Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.
rachel Really?!
phoebe Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And it's making me look at him totally differently. Y'know, I mean he used to be just, y'know “Jack Geller Monica and Ross's dad” and now he's he's “Jack Geller, dream hunk."
rachel I dunno. Y'know to me he'll always be “Jack Geller, walks in while you're changing.”
monica Y'know dad, Chandler is one of Ross's very best friends!
chandler Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, y'know I've always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.
mr_geller I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?
chandler He's the headliner of a gay burlesque show.
joey Rach, you're killin' us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!
rachel Look at it, isn't it beautiful?
ross Yeah, yeah, what is it?
rachel It's a truffle. It's got all of these layers. First there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!
ross W-What was the one right before bananas?
rachel The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, y'know, I thought “well, there's mincemeat pie,” I mean that's an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, y'know. Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?
joey Y-sure!
rachel And while I'm gone don't you boys sneak a taste.
joey_and_ross Okay.
ross Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!
joey I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?
ross Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!
joey Chandler!
ross Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperd's Pie!
joey Oh man! Now she's gonna start all over! We're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!
ross No, no, we will. We just won't tell her she messed up.
joey Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?
ross Yeah, it'll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!
joey Vomiting stories are funny...
rachel Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!
joey Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?
rachel No!
joey Still not hot enough!
phoebe Rachel?
rachel Yeah?
phoebe Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldn't give to be that can of condensed milk.
monica Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.
mrs_geller Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.
chandler Oh, yes. Well it's very beautiful. It's cream-colored and tight I don't mean tight, I mean it's not too tight, not that I was looking at-
mr_geller What's the matter with him?
mrs_geller I think he's stoned again.
chandler What?
monica What?
ross Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.
ross Okay, I think I might know why my parents don't like you.
chandler You do? Why?
ross Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.
chandler What?! Why did you do that?
ross I don't know, aheh, your's was the first name that-that popped into my head, I'm I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it would matter.
chandler How could it not matter?!
ross How was I supposed to know we'd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?
chandler What about all that “friends forever” stuff?
ross I don't know, I-I was all high.
monica Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you were trying to get Ross stoned!
chandler Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!
monica Ross, I can't believe you'd do that!
chandler The reason we haven't told them we're together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?
ross Okay, okay, I'll tell 'em it wasn't Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?
monica You! It's not like it's a big deal! You-you don't still do it or anything!
ross Alright, alright, now-now who should I say tricked me into doing it?
monica Dad, please don't pick your teeth out here! Alright, and if you're gonna put your feet up, why don't you sit on the-
phoebe Monica, leave him alone!
joey Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janine's friends are dancers?! And that they're going to be drinking alot!?
rachel No, I did, but tell me again, because it's so romantic.
joey Well you're whippin' so slow! Can't you do it any faster?
rachel Joey! Come on! I don't wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like “Oh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?”
rachel So why don't you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?
joey Oh I am!
monica Ross, if you don't tell them, then I will!
ross Okay, fine!
joey Ross! Can I talk to you for a second?
ross Oh, uh, can it wait a second Joey? I have to tell my parents something. No it can't? Okay.
joey Okay, look, I think we have to tell Rachel she messed up her dessert.
ross What?! What is with everybody? It's Thanksgiving, not...Truth-Day!
joey Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, they're all gonna' make fun of her, do you want that?
ross Okay, okay, we'll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie!
joey Dude, they're not objects.
joey Just kiddin,' I'll talk to them, you distract Rach.
ross Hey Rach, can I talk to you outside for a second?
rachel Okay...
rachel What's up, Ross?
ross So um...Thanksgiving. The holiday season is upon us, hm?
rachel Yeah!
ross And um...You look nice today.
rachel Oh no. No Ross, don't do this.
ross What?
rachel I just- I don't think us getting back together is a good idea.
ross Eh?
rachel I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Y'know? And it's probably really hard for you to be alone right now.
ross You're alone.
rachel No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean you're alone, alone. And I just-it's just not the time for us. I'm sorry.
ross Ah well, can't blame a guy for trying!
joey Oh and Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach or uh, or saying “mmm” and uh, oh oh! And smiling , okay?
chandler Yeah, I'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.
joey Rachel, there you are! Come on, let's serve that dessert already!
rachel Joey, you're gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You don't get any dessert.
joey Really?
rachel No, I'm just kidding I would never do that to you! Okay, everybody, it's trifle time!
phoebe So, now, Rach, this is a traditional English trifle, isn't it?
rachel It sure is.
phoebe Wow. So then did you make it with beef or Eggplant?
rachel Beef.
phoebe I can't have any. You know I don't eat meat. Ohhh no.
rachel Alright, Monica, I want you to have the first taste.
monica Really?
rachel Oh oh oh, wait! You only got whipped cream in there! Ya gotta take a bite with all the layers!
monica Okay.
rachel Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.
rachel Well?
monica Mmmm! It's good!
rachel Really? How good?
monica It's so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one who's eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.
all Mmm.
chandler Yeah, this is so good, that I'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.
mrs_geller I've gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica's room.
mr_geller I'll help you dial.
monica I'm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.
rachel Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.
ross Wha? No no! Ah! All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.
ross It tastes like feet!
joey I like it.
ross Are you kidding?
joey What's not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.
rachel ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?
chandler Yes, but if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.
phoebe Rachel, come here. Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.
rachel Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?
phoebe I dunno, let's see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.
rachel Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!
phoebe Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.
mr_geller Boy, I'm glad I wore the big belt today.
phoebe Five minutes ago, a line like that would've floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.
monica Ross? Let's go.
ross Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.
monica Alright, you know what? That's it. You've had your chance.
ross Wha-what?
monica Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!
mr_and_mrs_geller What?!
ross You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?
mr_and_mrs_geller Yes.
ross Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. I'm sorry.
mrs_geller It was you?
monica And Dad, y'know that mailman that you got fired? He didn't steal your Playboys! Ross did!
ross Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didn't break the porch swing, Monica did!
monica Ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year!
ross Monica and Chandler are living together!
monica Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!
phoebe I love Jacques Cousteau!
rachel I wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle!
joey I wanna gooooooo!
mrs_geller That's alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I'm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.
mr_geller And we kinda figured about the porch swing.
mrs_geller Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?
mr_geller What happened son?
ross I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!
mrs_geller Chandler! You've been Ross's best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. And now you've taken on Monica as well. Well, I don't know what to say. You're a wonderful human being.
chandler Thank you!
mr_geller No! Thank you! Monica, and Ross! I don't know what I'm gonna do about the two of you!
chandler I'll talk to them!
rachel You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldn't feel bad!
monica Well actually, I-I didn't eat mine. It's still in the bathroom.
joey No it isn't, I ate that.
mrs_geller Well we left ours in Monica's bedroom.
joey Nope, got it and I got yours too.
