monica_geller Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
chandler_bing I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
phoebe_buffay Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
monica_geller Phoebe!

dr_ross_geller I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
rachel_green No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm
dr_ross_geller Surely you can think of something good.
rachel_green Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.

rachel_green Uh-huh.
dr_ross_geller Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
rachel_green Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
dr_ross_geller A what?
rachel_green Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
dr_ross_geller One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
rachel_green Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
dr_ross_geller No.
dr_ross_geller Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
joey_tribbiani 'Sup? 'Sup dude?
chandler_bing Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
joey_tribbiani So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
chandler_bing Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
joey_tribbiani Come on man, really how old?!
chandler_bing Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
joey_tribbiani Wow thanks!
chandler_bing Joe?
joey_tribbiani Yeah!
chandler_bing Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
joey_tribbiani When? Today? Some, not a lot.
chandler_bing Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
joey_tribbiani Don't worry about that man, that happens.
chandler_bing It's happened to you?
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Once.
chandler_bing Well, what'd you do?
joey_tribbiani I did it anyway.
monica_geller Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
monica_geller No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
phoebe_buffay Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
monica_geller Fair enough, now go get ready!
phoebe_buffay Okay.
monica_geller I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
dr_ross_geller Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw
monica_geller Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
rachel_green What?
monica_geller See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
rachel_green Oh honey, but it is just about
dr_ross_geller It is! It is!
monica_geller No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
dr_ross_geller Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
rachel_green Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
dr_ross_geller Yeah!
monica_geller That's true.
rachel_green Honey I swear it we just kissed.
dr_ross_geller It was just a kiss.
phoebe_buffay You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
monica_geller Thunder being stolen!!
rachel_green Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
dr_ross_geller Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
chandler_bing I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
phoebe_buffay What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing What?!
joey_tribbiani You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
rachel_green No!
dr_ross_geller Oh no!
rachel_green No-no, it's really not huge.
dr_ross_geller And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
monica_geller Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
phoebe_buffay Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
joey_tribbiani Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
monica_geller Yes that would be lovely.
joey_tribbiani You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
chandler_bing Yes, you can pass for 19.
joey_tribbiani Really?
chandler_bing Yes!
joey_tribbiani Seriously?
chandler_bing Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
joey_tribbiani I'm 30!
rachel_green Joey, you are not! You're 31.
joey_tribbiani Aww crap!
phoebe_buffay Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
monica_geller Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
phoebe_buffay Why?!
rachel_green Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look
monica_geller No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
joey_tribbiani Psss, that is whack!
phoebe_buffay Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
phoebe_buffay Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
joey_tribbiani Wouldn't she?
phoebe_buffay Would she?
joey_tribbiani Would she? You ate my candy bar!
dr_ross_geller Guess who?
rachel_green Hey.
dr_ross_geller Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
rachel_green What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
dr_ross_geller Still thinking about it huh?
rachel_green Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
dr_ross_geller Oh, who cares?
rachel_green I care!
dr_ross_geller And so do I.
rachel_green Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
dr_ross_geller Okay. Sure.
rachel_green Am I going to let you watch me undress?
dr_ross_geller No!
monica_geller I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
chandler_bing Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
monica_geller Paris?
chandler_bing We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la
monica_geller Keep talking.
chandler_bing Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
monica_geller I love you!
monica_geller Bonjour, monsieur.
chandler_bing Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
chandler_bing It's Paris, who knows we're here!
monica_geller Hi Pheebs, what's up?
phoebe_buffay Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
monica_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
chandler_bing Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I see.
joey_tribbiani They break your heart, don't they?
phoebe_buffay Y'know, I don't really their permission.
joey_tribbiani Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
phoebe_buffay Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
joey_tribbiani What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
phoebe_buffay They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
joey_tribbiani And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
phoebe_buffay Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
chandler_bing Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
monica_geller Yes.
rachel_green Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
chandler_bing What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
rachel_green No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
monica_geller Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller Hey, here's a thought.
rachel_green Monica, what are you talking about?
monica_geller My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
chandler_bing Ahh, third base.
monica_geller It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
rachel_green Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
monica_geller We had a characturist!
rachel_green Oh!!
rachel_green Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
monica_geller And yet, here we are doing it again.
rachel_green Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
monica_geller Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
dr_ross_geller Got me.
rachel_green All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
monica_geller I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
rachel_green I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
monica_geller Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
dr_ross_geller Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
chandler_bing Why to save your dignity my man.
rachel_green Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
monica_geller I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
rachel_green Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
monica_geller I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
chandler_bing Well, somebody should.
dr_ross_geller Look uh, if we're gonna do this
rachel_green We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
dr_ross_geller Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
rachel_green Who is it?
monica_geller It's Monica, open up!
rachel_green Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
dr_ross_geller Oww!
rachel_green Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
monica_geller I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
chandler_bing How is that ever going to happen?!
rachel_green All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
monica_geller I know why!
rachel_green No you don't know why!
monica_geller Okay! Why?!
rachel_green Because! Because I was sad.
monica_geller What do you mean?
rachel_green Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
chandler_bing I don't care, she slept with me.
rachel_green Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
monica_geller I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
dr_ross_geller Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
chandler_bing Thanks.
dr_ross_geller And uh, Rachel.
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
chandler_bing Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
phoebe_buffay Oh thank you.
chandler_bing Okay.
phoebe_buffay Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
