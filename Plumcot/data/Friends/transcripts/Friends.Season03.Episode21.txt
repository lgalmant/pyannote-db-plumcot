anchorwoman#unknown#Friends.Season03.Episode21 While most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional Easter gifts. Some people insist on giving live chicks as presents. Unfortunately, the sad fact remains that most of these little guys won't live to see the fourth of July. Because of as a result of improper care, they will be dead.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, hi. You guys got any of those baby chicks? 'Cause I was watching this ah, commercial on TV and man, those guys are cute!
pete_becker Hi!

monica_geller Regular or decaf?
pete_becker Ah, which ever is closest.
monica_geller Okay.
pete_becker So ask me what I did today.
monica_geller So what did you do today Pete?
pete_becker I bought a restaurant and I would like you to be the head chef.
monica_geller What?! Oh.
monica_geller Can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?
rachel_green What a jerk! You want me to kick his ass?
monica_geller I mean this has been like my dream since I got my first Easy Bake Oven and opened Easy Monica's Bakery. I mean I would kill for this job. I mean I can totally do this job, and God knows I paid my dues. But Pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.
rachel_green And you're still not attracted to him at all?
monica_geller Hmm, no. I mean how can I accept a restaurant from him? I-I-I-I can't. I couldn't even accept a necklace from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.
rachel_green Yeah, but Mon that's totally different. He was you're health teacher.
monica_geller Oh, please.
monica_geller What? Honey.
rachel_green Oh, I am, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.
monica_geller Oh God, I'm so sorry.
rachel_green I know.
rachel_green Ow!!
monica_geller Oh God!
dr_ross_geller Hey, you guys! Guess what?
rachel_green Got a job on a river boat?
dr_ross_geller Y'know what I didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it. Well, guess what? You're not my girlfriend anymore so...
rachel_green Oh I see, so this suit is making a point.
dr_ross_geller Right.
rachel_green Now that you're on you're own, you're free to look as stupid as you like.
dr_ross_geller You like it right?
monica_geller Oh absolutely. I like it even more on you than I did on Colonel Sanders. Ross! Ross! I'm kidding!
rachel_green Yeah, come here!
monica_geller What-what was it you were gonna tell us?
rachel_green Yeah. Oh! Was how you invented the cotton gin?!
dr_ross_geller Okay, good bye!
chandler_bing So um, after you put the suggestion in the box, how long did it take for the roller skating thing to happen.
phoebe_buffay Umm, oh, about three months.
chandler_bing Okay, so I guess that's about ah, two weeks before the topless thing kicks in.
joey_tribbiani Hey!!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani I got you something! Open it! Open it!
chandler_bing Okay. It's a chicken.
joey_tribbiani It's cute, huh?
phoebe_buffay Whoa-whoa-whoa, you guys, do you know anything about chicks?
chandler_bing Fowl? No. Women? Nooo.
phoebe_buffay Okay, well they are a huge responsibility, especially at this age. They require constant care. They-they need just the right food, and lot's and lot's of love.
joey_tribbiani Oh, well no problem there.
chandler_bing Easy Lenny.
pete_becker So? I mean have you thought about it?
monica_geller Okay. Here's the thing.
pete_becker Oh no, not the thing. I hate the thing. What's the thing?
monica_geller I can't do it. I'm sorry, I wish I could, but umm, see you have these feelings for me....
pete_becker Wait, wait, wait, wait, that's-that's what you're worried about? If that's the problem, we've got no problem.
monica_geller Huh?
pete_becker No! Look, I was gonna tell you this over dinner, but I met somebody else. On my trip.
monica_geller Oh?
pete_becker Her name's Ann, she's a journalist. Ahh, we met on the plane. She asked me if she could finish off my peanuts, I thought she said something else, we had a big laugh. Yeah, I just, I mean I got, I got tired of waiting.
monica_geller Oh, that's great! I mean I'm-I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you. And now I can work for you!
pete_becker I guess you can.
monica_geller Oh my God! Oh, this is incredible! Ohh! All right, y'know what? I'm just gonna roll right into that office and-and quit!
pete_becker All right.
monica_geller Okay. Can you give me a little push?
pete_becker Yeah, sure. Good luck!
monica_geller I'm quitting!! Woo-hoo! I'm okay!! I'm all right!!
phoebe_buffay Wow! That's exciting, you went to Japan, made up a woman.
pete_becker What?
phoebe_buffay I'm just saying, this woman, I mean she's fictitious. No?
pete_becker Why would you say that?
phoebe_buffay 'Cause you're still into Monica. So you told her there was somebody else so she would agree to work with you, so 'cause you figure oh if you spent a lot of time together, maybe something might happen, and...
pete_becker You're good. You're good!
phoebe_buffay Yeah, no, I'm fairly intuitive and psychic. It's a substantial gift.
pete_becker Listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her though?
phoebe_buffay Absolutely, oh I promise. Tell her what?
pete_becker Thanks a lot.
phoebe_buffay No I'm serious. I mean I'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.
chandler_bing Okay, but this is the last time. With a chick-chick here, and a chick-chick there. Here a chick, there a chick, everywhere a chick-chick--chickeeeen.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani How's she doing?
chandler_bing She?
joey_tribbiani Well yeah, don't-don't you think it's a she?
chandler_bing I don't know. I can't tell, what ever it was went back in too quickly.
joey_tribbiani Well, anyway, I got to go change, I'm ah, meeting some of the cast for drinks.
chandler_bing Excuse me?
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing I stayed home from work today while you were at rehearsal so somebody could be here with our chick!
joey_tribbiani Hey! Who was up from 2 o'clock this morning until 5 o'clock this morning trying to get her back to sleep?
chandler_bing You don't think I get up when you get up?
joey_tribbiani Ohhh, here it comes.
chandler_bing Yes, here it comes! I'm stuck here all day, and then you come in and spend two seconds with us and then expect to go off gallivanting with your friends? Well I don't think so mister!
joey_tribbiani Hey!! I need to relax! Okay? I was working all day!
chandler_bing And you don't think taking care of our chick is work?
joey_tribbiani That's not what I said. Okay, I just meant...
chandler_bing I know what you meant!! You notice that ever since we got this chick, we've been fighting a lot more than we used too?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.
chandler_bing I'll take her back tomorrow.
joey_tribbiani Do you think we'll get our three bucks back?
dr_ross_geller Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
dr_ross_geller Ohhh, hey! All right, listen, I-I have that TV thing in like two hours, and I need your help, okay? What do you think? This blue suit, or this brown one?

dr_ross_geller No. No, y'know you don't, you don't wear enough of this. What?
rachel_green Since when, since when do you think I don't wear enough of this?
dr_ross_geller Well I, close your eyes, I just think you're gonna like this a little better, 'cause, close-close...

joey_tribbiani Hey!
chandler_bing Hey!
joey_tribbiani Ohhh. Ahh! What are you doing?! I thought you were gonna take her back to the store today.
chandler_bing I did! But the store wouldn't take her back! So then I took her to the shelter, and you know what I found out?
chandler_bing If they can't find a home for her, they kill her! And I'm not gonna let that happen to little Yasmine!
joey_tribbiani Okay, good, good, good, 'cause, good, 'cause I was kinda having second thoughts too.
chandler_bing Okay. And it's not just chicks y'know? It's all kinds of other animals!

pete_becker Look, the only who stands to get hurt is me. And I'm okay with that.
monica_geller You may be okay about getting hurt, but I am not okay with being the one who hurts you. That's why I can't take this job.
