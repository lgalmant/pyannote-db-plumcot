monica_geller So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.
all@ Ohhh.
monica_geller What?
dr_ross_geller Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
monica_geller You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
dr_ross_geller Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
joey_tribbiani Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are.
monica_geller Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.
monica_geller Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk.
chandler_bing Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.
dr_ross_geller I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.
monica_geller Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.
joey_tribbiani Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.
phoebe_buffay Why not her?
joey_tribbiani Cause she uh, she steals stuff.
chandler_bing Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
monica_geller Joey that is horriable.
joey_tribbiani Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I didn't know.
joey_tribbiani I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.
dr_ross_geller Hi honey, how did it go?
rachel_green Agh, it was the graduation from hell.
chandler_bing Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.
rachel_green Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica.
monica_geller So what happened?
rachel_green My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours.
phoebe_buffay Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents.
monica_geller Well, how bout just her mom?
chandler_bing Why her mom?
monica_geller Cause I already invited her.
phoebe_buffay Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?
joey_tribbiani Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals.
phoebe_buffay Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?
monica_geller Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan.
chandler_bing Excuse me?
monica_geller It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
joey_tribbiani Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo.
monica_geller Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
dr_leonard_green What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
monica_geller No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.
dr_leonard_green Ohhh, you're having a parteee.
monica_geller No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.
dr_leonard_green I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?
chandler_bing This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?
sandra_green Hi Monica.
monica_geller Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
chandler_bing So, basically just a Chinese guy.
joey_tribbiani Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.
dr_leonard_green Alright, that sounds like a two person job.
sandra_green Well, my goodness, what was that?
monica_geller Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.
sandra_green You thought I was Rachel?
chandler_bing Yes because uh, you look so young.
phoebe_buffay And because you're both, you know, white women.
sandra_green Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?
chandler_bing NO! No, I'll take that for ya.
sandra_green Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was...
phoebe_buffay Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon.
monica_geller Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
chandler_bing Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?
joey_tribbiani Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room.
monica_geller So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place.
chandler_bing Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?
monica_geller Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
joey_tribbiani Right this is staging.
chandler_bing Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area.
joey_tribbiani This is clearly in the wrong apartment.
chandler_bing Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin.
monica_geller Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross.
chandler_bing Ok, they're coming, shhh.
rachel_green Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner.
dr_ross_geller Thanks for being born.
rachel_green Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you.

monica_geller Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall.
dr_ross_geller What?

all@ Surprise.
dr_leonard_green Happy birthday sweetpea.
rachel_green Daddy.
rachel_green Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?
chandler_bing Well, we could count again.
rachel_green I can't believe this is happening.
dr_ross_geller You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares.
rachel_green I do.
dr_ross_geller That's who.
chandler_bing Look, are you gonna be ok?
rachel_green Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes.
chandler_bing Well, actually just one birthday flan.
rachel_green What?
chandler_bing It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee.
chandler_bing Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party.
joey_tribbiani Quick volleyball question.
chandler_bing Volleyball.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?
chandler_bing Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you.
girls_voice#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 Dennis.
chandler_bing Ok, that's me.
rachel_green Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while.
dr_ross_geller Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?
rachel_green Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok.
monica_geller Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out.
dr_ross_geller Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?
dr_leonard_green It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today.
dr_ross_geller I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
monica_geller Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going?
gunther I um, was sorta thinking about maybe...
monica_geller No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker.

dr_ross_geller No. no.
dr_leonard_green Whad'ya mean no?
dr_ross_geller No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir.
dr_leonard_green Get my glasses too.
dr_ross_geller All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time.
monica_geller Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?
monica_geller What? I don't see anything.
phoebe_buffay Great, I'm seeing water rings again.
mrs_geller#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 Ross, whose glasses are those?
dr_ross_geller Mine.
sandra_green You wear bi-focals?
dr_ross_geller Um-hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals.
sandra_green Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
rachel_green Well those are very popular frames.
dr_ross_geller Neil Sedaka wears them.
guy#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 I hear you can get people out of here.
sandra_green Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked.
rachel_green Yeah, like a chimney.
dr_ross_geller Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.
dr_leonard_green Are you wearing my glasses?
dr_ross_geller Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
dr_leonard_green Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
dr_ross_geller Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip.
phoebe_buffay Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute.
girl_1#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 What about my friend Victor?
phoebe_buffay No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious.
girl_1#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 Alright, let me just get my coat.
phoebe_buffay There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
girl_1#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 Is it true they have beer?
phoebe_buffay Everything you've heard is true.
monica_geller Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament.
monica_geller You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here?
gunther Um
phoebe_buffay Ok, welcome to the fu-oh.
monica_geller Phoebe.
phoebe_buffay Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go.
monica_geller Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance...
rachel_green You want me to see a therapist?
sandra_green Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.
rachel_green Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing.
dr_leonard_green Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
rachel_green Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff.
sandra_green You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
dr_leonard_green You work and you work and you work on a boat...
sandra_green He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
dr_leonard_green ..and you sand it and you varnish it...
sandra_green ..but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.
dr_leonard_green ..and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
sandra_green ..the scotch and the cigarettes...
dr_leonard_green ..and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
sandra_green ..I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
dr_leonard_green ..what the hell does she want with half a boat...
chandler_bing Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor.
rachel_green This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?
chandler_bing Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed.
rachel_green Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July.
chandler_bing Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
rachel_green It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
chandler_bing I, I know.
monica_geller Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun.
sandra_green Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem.
monica_geller Ok will do. So glad you came.
sandra_green I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
monica_geller Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye.
rachel_green Oh ok.
sandra_green Happy birthday sweetie.
rachel_green Ok.
joey_tribbiani Ahh, you drive safe.
sandra_green Ross, what're you doing.
dr_ross_geller I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing?
chandler_bing Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?
dr_leonard_green To get my coat.
guys#unknown#Friends.Season02.Episode22 No no no.
dr_leonard_green Alright, alright, I can get my own coat.
chandler_bing Sorry, we're on a major flan high.
phoebe_buffay Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe.
dr_leonard_green I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you.
phoebe_buffay Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway.
joey_tribbiani Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care.
sandra_green Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years.
monica_geller Thank you.
monica_geller Ok everybody, it's time for flan.
chandler_bing Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun.
joey_tribbiani Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
monica_geller Ok, that's enough.
phoebe_buffay Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish.
rachel_green Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true.
