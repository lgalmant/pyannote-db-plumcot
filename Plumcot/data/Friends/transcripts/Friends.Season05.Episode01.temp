phoebe Uh, hello, this is Ross Geller's personal physician, Dr. Philange.
mrs_waltham Who?
phoebe Yeah, I've discovered that Ross forgot to take his brain medicine, uh, now without it, uh, in the brain of Ross, uh women's names are interchangeable, through-through no fault of his own.
mrs_waltham Oh my God, Phoebe.
phoebe No, not Phoebe, Dr. Philange. Oh no! You have it too!
phoebe Hello?
chandler Hey.
monica Hey.
chandler Oh wow, I hope you don't take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and, ugh, I'm just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.
monica I know. How could we have let this happen?
chandler Seven times!
monica Ugh! Well, y'know, we were away
chandler In a foreign, romantic country
monica I blame London.
chandler Bad London!
monica So look umm, while we're st-still in London, I mean, we can keep doing it right?
chandler Well, I don't see that we have a choice. But, when we're back home, we don't do it.
monica Only here.
chandler Y'know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs
monica I'll meet you there in two minutes.
chandler Okay!
rachel Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something.
monica Now?
rachel Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can't pretend that didn't happen can I?
monica Oh, I-I don't know.
rachel Monica, what should I do?
monica Just uh, do the right thing.
rachel What?
monica Toe the line. Thread the needle. Think outside the box!
rachel Whoa, wait, listen, I think I'm just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.
monica Wait. Rachel, no, he's married. Married! If you don't realize that, I can't help you.
rachel Okay, you're right. You're right. You can't help me.
mrs_geller Jack, is it all our fault? Were we bad parents?
mr_waltham Yes.
mr_geller Oh yeah, well who serves steak when there's no place to sit, I mean how are you supposed to eat this?
joey Hey, what's up?
monica Where were you? We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar?
chandler Forget it, that's off.
monica Why?!
mr_waltham The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes
monica Joey, what are you doing? You promised Phoebe you wouldn't eat meat until she has the babies!
joey Well, I figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.
monica That's true.
chandler The man's got a point.
rachel Oh, hi!
ross Hi!
rachel Hi. Sorry, things aren't working out so well.
ross Oh no! It could be better, but it's gonna be okay, right?
rachel Oh yeah! Of course, I mean, she's gonna get over this, y'know? I mean, so you said my name! Y'know you just said it 'cause you saw me there, if you'd have seen a circus freak, you would've said, "I take thee circus freak." Y'know, it didn't mean anything, it's just a mistake. It didn't mean anything. Right?
ross No! No! Of course it didn't mean anything! I mean, uh well, I can understand why Emily would think it meant something, y'know, because-because it was you
rachel Right
ross But it absolutely didn't. It didn't!! It didn't!!
joey Ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so
ross Oh! Oh-oh, the band's ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says-I don't care about the stupid band!!
joey You spit on me man!
ross Look, I'm sorry.
joey Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?
rachel Y'know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.
ross Oh, right!
rachel Get the hell out of there, y'know?
ross Emily? Emily? I'm coming in.
rachel Well, look at that, same thing.
chandler Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me.
monica Oh my God, Rachel! Hi!
chandler Oh, hello Rachel.
rachel Ross said my name. Okay? My name. Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me! Okay, don't believe me, I know I'm right-do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?
chandler Yes, we do. But, we have to change first.
monica Yes, I want to change. And why-why don't you go down and get us a table?
chandler Yeah, we'll be down in like five minutes.
monica Fifteen minutes.
rachel Okay.
rachel Hello? Oh, Pheebs! It's Phoebe!
chandler Oh, yay
monica Great
rachel Hi!
phoebe Hi, so what happened?
rachel Well, Ross said my name.
phoebe Yeah, I know, but I don't think that means anything.
rachel Okay, Pheebs, y'know what, let's look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then
chandler Hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?
monica But my clothes are-ohh!
chandler Wow, you look
monica No time for that!
joey Hey, dude, let me in. I got a girl out here!
chandler Well, I've got a girl in here.
joey No you don't, I just saw you go in there with Monica!
chandler Well, we're-we're hanging out in here!
joey Look, which one of us is gonna be having sex in there, me or you?
chandler Well, I suppose I'd have to say you!! But, what if we're watching a movie in here?
monica Which we are, and-and we already paid for it. It's My Giant!
joey My Giant? I love that movie!
monica You really think this is okay?
chandler Well, Ross and Emily aren't gonna use it.
monica Oh, it's so beautiful. Ohh! Y'know, I-I don't know if I feel right about this.
chandler Oh Mon-Mon-Mon-Mon-look, this is the honeymoon suite. The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.
monica Okay!
chandler Okay!
ross Emily?!
chandler Nope, not under here!
monica You didn't find her?
ross No, I've looked everywhere!
chandler Well, you couldn't have looked everywhere or else you would've found her!
monica Yeah, I think you should keep looking!
chandler Yeah, for about 30 minutes.
monica Or 45.
chandler Wow, in 45 minutes you can find her twice.
ross No! For all I know, she's trying to find me but couldn't because I kept moving around. No, from now on, I'm staying in one place. Right here.
monica Well, it's getting late.
chandler Yeah, we're gonna go.
ross Actually, do you guys mind staying here for a while?
monica Ugh, y'know, umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for New York.
chandler Yeah, it's a very large plane.
ross That's cool.
chandler But, we'll stay here with you.
ross Thanks guys! I really appreciate this, y'know, but you don't have to rub my butt.
chandler We have to leave for New York in an hour.
monica I know, I've been looking at those doors, they look pretty sound proof, don't you think?
chandler We can't do that that's insane. I mean 'A' he could wake up and 'B' y'know, let's go for it.
ross Em-Emily? Em-Emily? Emily!
mr_waltham No.
mrs_waltham You can forget about Emily, she's not with us.
mr_waltham We've come for her things.
ross Wait, well wh-wh-wh-where is she?
mr_waltham She's in hiding. She's utterly humiliated. She doesn't want to see you ever again.
mrs_waltham We're very sad that it didn't work out between you and Emily, monkey. But, I think you're absolutely delicious.
mr_waltham Excuse me, I'm standing right here!
mrs_waltham Oh yes, there you are.
rachel Hey-hey, you guys oh hurry up, get some, there's a whole cart outside
mr_waltham Goodbye Geller.
ross Now, hold on! Hold on! Look, look, your daughter and I are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon, now-now you-you tell her that I'm gonna be at that airport and I hope that she'll be there too! Oh yeah, I said Rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything, Okay? She's-she's just a friend and that's all! That's all! Now just tell Emily that I love her and that I can't imagine spending my life with anyone else. Please, promise me that you'll tell her that.
mr_waltham All right, I'll tell her. Come on bugger face!
mrs_waltham Call me.
mr_waltham You spend half your life in the bathroom, why don't you ever go out the bloody window!
monica Y'know, maybe it's best that we never got to do it again.
chandler Yeah, it kinda makes that-that one night special. Y'know, technically we still are over international waters.
monica I'm gonna go to the bathroom, maybe I'll see you there in a bit?
chandler 'Kay!
joey Can I ask you something?
chandler Uhh, no.
joey Felicity and I, we're watching My Giant, and I was thinking, "I'm never gonna be as good an actor as that giant." Do you think I'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?
chandler No.
joey I mean, the giant is like five years younger than me, y'know, you think I'll ever get there?
chandler Yes.
joey Thanks man.
chandler Okay man.
joey But what about how much taller he is than me?
joey I mean, there's no way I can make myself taller now, y'know? And who knows what science will come up with in the future, but Chandler, what if I die an unsuccessful, regular sized man?
joey Hey, Monica, wow you've been in the bathroom for like a half-hour.
monica I know!
joey Had the beef-tips, huh?
phoebe Hey!
chandler Hey!
joey Hi!
phoebe You ate meat! You had sex!
chandler No we didn't!
phoebe I know you didn't, I was talking about Monica.
monica Phoebe, I did not have sex.
phoebe This pregnancy is throwing me all off.
joey All right, I'm gonna go say hi the chick and the duck.
phoebe Oh, me too!
joey Why would you need to say hi to them, you've been feeding them for four days?
phoebe Oh right, maybe I'll just go home.
monica Well, we certainly are alone.
chandler Yes! Good thing we have that, 'Not in New York' rule.
monica Right. Umm, listen since we're-we-re on that subject, umm, I just wanted to tell you that uh, well, I-I was going through a really hard time in London, what with my brother getting married and that guy thinking I was Ross's mother
chandler Right.
monica Well, an-anyway, I just-that night meant a lot to me, I guess I'm just trying to say thanks.
chandler Oh. Y'know, that night meant a lot to me too, and it wasn't because I was in a bad place or anything, it just meant a lot to me 'cause, you're really hot! Is that okay?
monica That's okay.
chandler And I'm cute too.
monica And you're cute too.
chandler Thank you! All right, I gotta go unpack.
monica Okay.
chandler Bye.
chandler I'm still on London time, does that count?
monica That counts!
chandler Oh, good!
ross Rach! Rach!

rachel Well, I-I-I've been on Standby for a flight home for hours.

rachel So umm, what time are you supposed to leave?
gate_agent This is the last call for Flight 1066 to Athens. The last call.
ross Pretty soon I guess.
rachel Yeah. I'm sorry.
ross I just, I don't understand, I mean, how-how can she do this? Y'know, what, am I, am I like a complete idiot for thinking that she'd actually show up?
rachel No, you're not an idiot, Ross. You're a guy very much in love.
ross Same difference.
gate_agent All ticketed passengers for Flight 1066 to Athens should now be on board.
ross I get it! Well, that's that.
rachel No, you know what, I think you should go.
ross What?
rachel Yeah, I do. I think you should go, by yourself, get some distance, clear your head, I think it'd be really good.
ross Oh, I don't, I don't, I don't know
rachel Oh, come on Ross! I think it would be really good for you!
ross I could, yeah, I can do that.
rachel Yeah.
ross I can't, I can't even believe her! No, y'know what, I am, I am gonna go!
rachel Good!
ross I know, why not?
rachel Right!
ross Right?
rachel Right!
ross Y'know-thanks!
rachel Okay, I'll see you back at home, if I ever get a flight out of here.
ross Yeah, well...nah.
rachel What? Wait, what?
ross Why don't you come, I mean, I-I have two tickets, why not?
rachel Well-well, I don't know Ross-really?
ross Yeah, yeah, it'll be great! You can, you can lay on the beach and I can cry over my failed marriage. See-see how I make jokes?
