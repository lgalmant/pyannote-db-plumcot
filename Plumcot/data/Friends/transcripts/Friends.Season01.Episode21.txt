joey_tribbiani How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
monica_geller I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
rachel_green Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
monica_geller I know. It's just such reckless spending.
dr_ross_geller I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
chandler_bing Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
monica_geller That's me.
phoebe_buffay Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
dr_ross_geller Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
rachel_green Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
monica_geller Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
dr_ross_geller What? It's, it's just a phase.
chandler_bing Well, that's what we said about Joey...
dr_ross_geller Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
rachel_green Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
dr_ross_geller What?
rachel_green Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
rachel_green Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
monica_geller This woman's living my life.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
rachel_green You're not an artist.
monica_geller Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
rachel_green Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
monica_geller Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
rachel_green Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
monica_geller Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
rachel_green Nooo...
monica_geller This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
chandler_bing How about Joey... Pepponi?
joey_tribbiani No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
chandler_bing Joey... Switzerland?
joey_tribbiani Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
chandler_bing Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
joey_tribbiani Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
chandler_bing Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
joey_tribbiani Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
chandler_bing Might wanna try Joseph.
joey_tribbiani Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
chandler_bing Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Hey.
monica_geller Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
phoebe_buffay What are you doing?
monica_geller Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
rachel_green What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
monica_geller This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
rachel_green Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!..Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
phoebe_buffay This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!!..Thank you.
monica_geller What d'you think?
phoebe_buffay Lotsa things.
rachel_green Which one do you think she is?
the_teacher May I help you?
monica_geller Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
the_teacher You don't observe a dance class. You dance
rachel_green What does she mean?
phoebe_buffay I think she means 'You dance
monica_geller Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
the_teacher People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
rachel_green She could be you.
the_teacher Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
monica_geller Okay, I'm not getting this!
phoebe_buffay I'm totally getting it!
monica_geller Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
rachel_green What? You just click when they click.
the_teacher Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
phoebe_buffay Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
monica_geller Great. It's gym class all over again.
phoebe_buffay@rachel_green Aww.
the_teacher Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
monica_geller Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode21 It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
the_teacher She's your partner.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode21 Hi. I'm Monica.
monica_geller Oh. Monica!..Hi. I'm Mo-..nana.
woman#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode21 Monana?
monica_geller Yeah. It's Dutch.
fake_monica You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
monica_geller Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
the_teacher And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
dr_ross_geller Hi.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani Hey.
joey_tribbiani Where've you been?
dr_ross_geller At the vet.
chandler_bing She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
dr_ross_geller She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
joey_tribbiani Hey! He beat ya.
dr_ross_geller She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
chandler_bing So what does this mean?
dr_ross_geller I'm gonna have to give him up.
joey_tribbiani I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
chandler_bing I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
dr_ross_geller I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
joey_tribbiani Isn't there any way you can keep him?
dr_ross_geller No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
joey_tribbiani How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
chandler_bing I know that one!..No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
dr_ross_geller Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
chandler_bing Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
phoebe_buffay Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
chandler_bing What?
joey_tribbiani Did you call the cops?
rachel_green Nope. We took her to lunch.
chandler_bing Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
dr_ross_geller What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
monica_geller Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
chandler_bing ..Take off their hats!
phoebe_buffay Popes in a Volkswagen!..I love that joke.
rachel_green No way. No way did you do this.
fake_monica Monana was very brave.
monica_geller It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
fake_monica So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
monica_geller ..They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
rachel_green Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
fake_monica Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
monica_geller 'Scuse me?
fake_monica There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
monica_geller Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
fake_monica Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
monica_geller What?
fake_monica Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
monica_geller Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
fake_monica I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
monica_geller Uh-huh.
fake_monica I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
monica_geller Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
dr_ross_geller Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
phoebe_buffay I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
dr_ross_geller Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
rachel_green Oh, somebody will.
joey_tribbiani You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
chandler_bing You're kidding.
joey_tribbiani Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
chandler_bing Y'know, you'd think I would've.
joey_tribbiani Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
phoebe_buffay ..Flame Boy.
dr_ross_geller Where exactly is your zoo?
dr_baldharar Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
dr_ross_geller Yes.
dr_baldharar Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
dr_ross_geller No-no, he's, he's very docile.
dr_baldharar Even if he were... cornered?
dr_ross_geller Well I, I don't know. Why?
dr_baldharar Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
dr_ross_geller He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
dr_baldharar How about a hammer, or a small blade?
dr_ross_geller Why- why- why would he need a blade?
dr_baldharar Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
chandler_bing@joey_tribbiani He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
joey_tribbiani We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
chandler_bing ..He's in.
dr_ross_geller He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
dr_baldharar You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
monica_geller Yo- hooo!
rachel_green Where the hell've you been?
monica_geller Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
rachel_green Are you drunk?!
monica_geller Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
rachel_green Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
rachel_green Monica? Monica!
monica_geller Water rules!
rachel_green Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
monica_geller Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
rachel_green Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
monica_geller No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
rachel_green Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
monica_geller Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
rachel_green What?
monica_geller They've arrested Monica.
monica_geller Hi.
fake_monica Hey.
monica_geller How are you?
fake_monica I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
monica_geller Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
fake_monica That I was not expecting.
monica_geller I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
fake_monica Oh. Thanks.
monica_geller No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
fake_monica Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
monica_geller I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
fake_monica Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
monica_geller Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
fake_monica There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
monica_geller Not necessarily...
fake_monica Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
monica_geller Um, I'm not actually Amish.
fake_monica Really? Then why are you like that?
the_teacher You by the door. In or out?
monica_geller In.
the_teacher You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
monica_geller Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
pa#unknown#Friends.Season01.Episode21 This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
phoebe_buffay Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.

phoebe_buffay Oh!

joey_tribbiani I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
dr_ross_geller Just, just say what you feel.
joey_tribbiani Marcel, I'm hungry.
dr_ross_geller That was good.
rachel_green Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
dr_ross_geller Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
all@ Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
dr_ross_geller Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
actor Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
