joey I want you.I need you.Let me make love to you.
rachel I don't wanna stand in the way of true love or anything, but I think a cantaloupe might hurt less.
joey Oh, ehm...I'm...I'm rehearsing my lines.They gave me a big romantic story on Days Of Our Lives. It's the first time my character's got one. I'm so nervous, you know, I really want it to be good!
rachel Woow!I haven't seen you this worked up since you did that dog food commercial and you thought you were gonna be with a real talking dog!
joey Yeah, that was a disappointment... Oh, hey!D'you want to come down to the set and tell me if I'm doing ok?
rachel Are you serious?
joey Yeah!Hey, you just have to promise not to get yourself thrown out again.
rachel Hey, that was an honest mistake!
joey Right!"Oh my God, is this the men's room? Oh, I feel so foolish, have you always known you wanted to be an actor?"
rachel Yeah, that was an awesome day!
monica Hey!

chandler Oh, that's ok.I'll just try and reschedule. "Hi, this is Chandler Bing. I made a reservation there and I need to change it Oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? Can I just come some other time? Oh, can't you make an exception?"
monica Tell them I'm a chef in a big New York restaurant!

chandler "Look, this is ridiculous! I'm not paying for that room! Ok?" "Oh, thank you very much!" Yeah, I'm going to Vermont...
ross Oh, don't worry about it! Just use your travel insurance.
chandler I don't have travel insurance.
ross Well, this is what happens when people live on the edge!
monica Why don't you take Ross?
ross Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...
monica No, not if their room has two beds!
ross I guess...It still seems a little... moonlight boat ride!!
rachel Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?
joey I don't know, but one of the extras sure did! Hey, listen Rach. Thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes!
rachel Oh, please!Honey, just the fact that you want me here to support you, I'm...OH MY GOD!Is that Christian Sanders?He's so gorgeous!

monica Thank you! You haven't said anything...
3rd_customer Actually I do have one small complaint.
monica Oh..please!I-I welcome criticism.
3rd_customer The musician right outside the restaurant...it's kind of a mood-killer!
monica What musician?
phoebe And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. OlÃ¨!
monica What are you doing here!
phoebe Well, you said that you had customers lined up in the street, so I am here to entertain!
monica Great!

monica Listen Phoebe...
phoebe Yeah.
monica You know how much I love listening to your music, you know, but...
phoebe But what?
monica This is kind of a classy place.
phoebe Ok, say no more.
time_lapse Phoebe in front of restaurant again]
chandler Hi, Chandler Bing, I have a reservation.
receptionist Welcome to the Chestnut Inn Mr. Bing, so where are you joining from?
chandler New York.
ross The big apple!
chandler I'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.
ross Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.
receptionist I am sorry Mr. Bing, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.
chandler Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?
ross Check again please!
receptionist I'm sorry, it's not here.
ross Not there.
chandler Let me get this straight. I called yesterday trying to cancel my reservation and I was told it was not refundable, then we drove six hours all the way up here and now you tell me that we don't have a reservation?
receptionist I don't know what to say.
ross She doesn't know what to say!
chandler Just give us the cheapest room you have.
receptionist Unfortunatly the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite, the rate is six hundred dollars.
chandler That's insane!
ross Totally insane. Dude, let's drive home, we'll hit all the maple candy stores on the way back and if...if they're closed maybe we'll tap a tree and make some ourselves.
chandler Does that room have a closet I can lock him in? We'll take it.
receptionist Great.
chandler What!? They are totally ripping us off!
ross Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!
chandler Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!
ross C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!
chandler Dude, you're shaking!
ross I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?
rachel Hi!
joey Hey!
rachel Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!
joey Oh, you know, the writing was good, and the director is good, and... and my co-star's good but they're not as good as me!
rachel God, you have to tell me what happens tomorrow!
joey Ow, I'm just going over the script now! You wanna read lines with me?
rachel Me? Oh, no, I am not an actress.
joey Oh, all right, I can ask Monica.
rachel Oh screw her, that part is mine!
joey Right... ok, so just from the top of the page, right here.
rachel Okay. . Hello Drake, I'm surprised to see you here.
joeydrake I can't believe you married him.
rachelactress But what choice did I have. He was keeping my sister in a dungeon!
joeydrake So what about us? Everything we feel for each other.
rachelactress It's over! You have to accept that.
joeydrake How can I? Knowing I'll never hold you in my arms again, or touch your skin, or feel your lips, knowing I'll never make love to you? How can I accept that... I can never kiss you again when it's all I can do not to kiss you right now.
rachel Kiss me.
joey What?
rachel Kiss me.
joey Ah, Rach, it doesn't say that!
rachel No, I'm saying...
joey but, but..
rachel just... don't talk...
rachel Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!
ross Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.
ross What did you get?
chandler USA Today
ross Nice, put it with the others.
chandler And I also got... two more apples.
ross We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!
chandler I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.
ross Oh, that's not cool.
chandlers Dude, none of this is cool.
ross No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example
chandler I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.
ross Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.
chandler Ok, how about this ?
ross No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!
chandler Yes, but the batteries...
chandler Thank you, thank you very much!
ross Let's celebrate with some maple candy!
chandler No!
ross At least tell me where you hid it.
rachel Can I ask you a question?
monica Yeah.
rachel Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?
monica Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.
rachel Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.
monica Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?
rachel Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.
monica What do you think brought than on?
rachel I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.
monica A love scene? With who?
rachel Olivia.
monica Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.
rachel So do you think that my dream means anything?
monica I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.
rachel Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
monica Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.
rachel You took the same class twice.
monica It was hard!
phoebe Hey!
rachel_and_monica Hi.
phoebe Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.
monica Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.
phoebe Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.
monica Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.
phoebe Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back .
rachel Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...
phoebe My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?
rachel Ok, we're still on that.
monica I didn't say your songs were not good enough.
phoebe Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?
monica Tiny portions?
phoebe Yeah well, "excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it"!
monica Phoebe, it's not about quantity.
phoebe Well...it's not about quality.
monica Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.
phoebe Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.
monica Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.
phoebe Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?
monica You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.
phoebe What are people having, the garlic Martini?
receptionist Here's your copy of the bill, we hope you enjoyed your stay.
chandler Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.
chandler Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.
ross Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game.
ross Oh my god.
chandler What?
ross There's something new in the bowl.
chandler Look, we have enough, just walk away.
ross No, but I want...I want the pinecones!
chandler There's a forest right outside.
ross It's not the same.
chandler Ok, go quick!
ross Thank you for a delightful stay.
ross Oh, my maple candy!
phoebe Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you..
monica Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.
phoebe You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.
monica Ok, you have to stop playing now.
phoebe Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!
monica Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!
phoebe Get your garlic-peelers off me!
monica Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question
phoebe Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!
monica Alright, let me ask you this question
phoebe Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?
monica Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?
phoebe Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .
monica Excuse us! Alright here's a question
phoebe Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!
monica I'm sorry...
phoebe I'm sorry too...
monica ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?
phoebe Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p...
phoebe Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?
rachel Hey!
joey Hey!
rachel Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?
joey Oh man! I thought I got it all!
rachel How...how...?
joey I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?
rachel uh-huh
joey And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!
rachel Wow...definitely just Drake...
joey What?
rachel What...how is it going with Drake?
joey Oh...I don't think it's going very well...
rachel What...that scene I saw was so good!
joey Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...
rachel Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?
joey A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.
rachel So?
joey So...I've never played that!
rachel Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?
joey Uh...well...just once...with you...
rachel Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?
joey What the hell are you talking about??
rachel Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.
joey Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.
rachel Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...
joey Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.
joey Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!!
chandler I got you something from Vermont!
monica Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty!
ross Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?
