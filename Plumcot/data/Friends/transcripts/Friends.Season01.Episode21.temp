joey How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
monica I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
rachel Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought.
monica I know. It's just such reckless spending.
ross I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.
chandler Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop.
monica That's me.
phoebe Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again!
ross Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back- come here, Marcel-
rachel Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him.
monica Ross, you've got to do something about the humping.
ross What? It's, it's just a phase.
chandler Well, that's what we said about Joey...
ross Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
rachel Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
ross What?
rachel Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
rachel Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.
monica This woman's living my life.
rachel What?
monica She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
rachel You're not an artist.
monica Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.
rachel Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.
monica Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.
rachel Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...
monica Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
rachel Nooo...
monica This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.
chandler How about Joey... Pepponi?
joey No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.
chandler Joey... Switzerland?
joey Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. Which I'm not.
chandler Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
joey Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
chandler Well, it does not ring a bell with me...
joey Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.
chandler Might wanna try Joseph.
joey Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
chandler Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
rachel Hey.
phoebe Hey.
monica Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were.
phoebe What are you doing?
monica Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class.
rachel What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?
monica This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is.
rachel Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!..Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing.
phoebe This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, don't do it!!..Thank you.
monica What d'you think?
phoebe Lotsa things.
rachel Which one do you think she is?
teacher May I help you?
monica Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe.
teacher You don't observe a dance class. You dance
rachel What does she mean?
phoebe I think she means 'You dance
monica Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?
teacher People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
rachel She could be you.
teacher Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight...
monica Okay, I'm not getting this!
phoebe I'm totally getting it!
monica Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
rachel What? You just click when they click.
teacher Alright people, now everyone grab a partner.
phoebe Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel.
monica Great. It's gym class all over again.
phoebe_and_rachel Aww.
teacher Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me.
monica Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
woman It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?
teacher She's your partner.
woman Hi. I'm Monica.
monica Oh. Monica!..Hi. I'm Mo-..nana.
woman Monana?
monica Yeah. It's Dutch.
fake_monica You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam.
monica Um, Pennsylvania Dutch.
teacher And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight...
ross Hi.
chandler_and_joey Hey.
joey Where've you been?
ross At the vet.
chandler She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?
ross She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
joey Hey! He beat ya.
ross She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.
chandler So what does this mean?
ross I'm gonna have to give him up.
joey I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!
chandler I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?
ross I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg.
joey Isn't there any way you can keep him?
ross No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.
joey How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
chandler I know that one!..No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.
ross Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.
chandler Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.
phoebe Hey. We found her, we found the girl.
chandler What?
joey Did you call the cops?
rachel Nope. We took her to lunch.
chandler Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
ross What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
monica Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit.
ross Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.
chandler ..Take off their hats!
phoebe Popes in a Volkswagen!..I love that joke.
rachel No way. No way did you do this.
fake_monica Monana was very brave.
monica It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
fake_monica So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...
monica ..They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
rachel Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.
fake_monica Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.
monica 'Scuse me?
fake_monica There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?
monica Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.
fake_monica Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background.
monica What?
fake_monica Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?
monica Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.
fake_monica I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
monica Uh-huh.
fake_monica I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.
monica Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
ross Oh God. We didn't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him.
phoebe I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
ross Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?
rachel Oh, somebody will.
joey You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
chandler You're kidding.
joey Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
chandler Y'know, you'd think I would've.
joey Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
phoebe ..Flame Boy.
ross Where exactly is your zoo?
dr_baldhara Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?
ross Yes.
dr_baldhara Does he, uh, fight with other animals?
ross No-no, he's, he's very docile.
dr_baldhara Even if he were... cornered?
ross Well I, I don't know. Why?
dr_baldhara Uh, how is he at handling small objects?
ross He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...
dr_baldhara How about a hammer, or a small blade?
ross Why- why- why would he need a blade?
dr_baldhara Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel.
chandler_and_joey He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego.
joey We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...
chandler ..He's in.
ross He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!
dr_baldhara You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains.
monica Yo- hooo!
rachel Where the hell've you been?
monica Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
rachel Are you drunk?!
monica Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk.
rachel Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried...
rachel Monica? Monica!
monica Water rules!
rachel Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?
monica Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
rachel Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!
monica No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!
rachel Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people.
monica Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
rachel What?
monica They've arrested Monica.
monica Hi.
fake_monica Hey.
monica How are you?
fake_monica I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How-how did you know I was here?
monica Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
fake_monica That I was not expecting.
monica I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in.
fake_monica Oh. Thanks.
monica No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater!
fake_monica Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'.
monica I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?
fake_monica Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?
monica Well, not... worried, just... wondering.
fake_monica There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are.
monica Not necessarily...
fake_monica Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing.
monica Um, I'm not actually Amish.
fake_monica Really? Then why are you like that?
teacher You by the door. In or out?
monica In.
teacher You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!
monica Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!
pa This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A.
phoebe Okay. Good-bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the plane.
ross Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe.
phoebe Oh!
chandler Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn.
joey I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey.
ross Just, just say what you feel.
joey Marcel, I'm hungry.
ross That was good.
rachel Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane.
ross Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him.
all Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely.
ross Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be- Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him.
actor Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek...
casting_director_no_1 That's fine, thank you.
casting_director_no_2 Next.
joey Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio.
casting_director_no_2 Name?
joey Holden McGroin.
