chandler_bing Hey! Ready to go?
dr_ross_geller Oh yeah, let me just finish this.
joey_tribbiani Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!
chandler_bing What are you doin'?
dr_ross_geller Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.
chandler_bing Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless
dr_ross_geller It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?
chandler_bing The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?
dr_ross_geller Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...
chandler_bing Bet she'd sleep with you now...
dr_ross_geller No... I already e-mailed her.
chandler_bing Let me see what you wrote about yourself: "Doctor Paleontology, two kids... " You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!
dr_ross_geller You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.
joey_tribbiani Hey!
dr_ross_geller What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??
chandler_bing Maybe we finish this for him! "Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had"... aaand SEND!
joey_tribbiani No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!
dr_ross_geller Alright, let's go!
joey_tribbiani Dude!
dr_ross_geller I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!
joey_tribbiani aaand SEND!
rachel_green Hey! How was basketball?
joey_tribbiani Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!
rachel_green Oh, no! Who did that?
joey_tribbiani Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?
rachel_green She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!
rachel_green Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!
joey_tribbiani Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...
rachel_green All right... Oh, Emma loves him!
joey_tribbiani Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!
phoebe_buffay Hi.
monica_geller Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
phoebe_buffay Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!
chandler_bing Oh, I'm so sorry!
phoebe_buffay Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...
chandler_bing You're not gonna need my help?
phoebe_buffay Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.
chandler_bing Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth
phoebe_buffay Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.
monica_geller Ok, you got it!
phoebe_buffay Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.
monica_geller Really? If that's what you want...
phoebe_buffay That was a test and you just failed.
monica_geller Damn it! Rookie mistake!
dr_ross_geller I have sex with dinosaurs??
chandler_bing I believe I read that somewhere!
dr_ross_geller That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!
chandler_bing I respectfully disagree.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!
chandler_bing Who cares? Nobody reads those things
dr_ross_geller You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.
chandler_bing I don't have a page.
dr_ross_geller Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!
joey_tribbiani Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.
rachel_green : Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!
joey_tribbiani It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.
rachel_green What are you doing?
joey_tribbiani Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.
rachel_green Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.
joey_tribbiani There you go sweetie... This isn't over.
monica_geller Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... "gay as the day is long"?
chandler_bing Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.
monica_geller But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.
chandler_bing Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.
monica_geller Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.
chandler_bing Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go
monica_geller What are you doing?
chandler_bing Oh, you'll see my friend.
dr_ross_geller I'm dead?
chandler_bing And so young.
dr_ross_geller Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.
chandler_bing Well, how you died was funny.
dr_ross_geller Oh please, hit by a blimp?
chandler_bing It kills over one americans every year.
dr_ross_geller Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.
chandler_bing You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!
dr_ross_geller You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.
phoebe_buffay God, I wish Mike were here.
monica_geller Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?
monica_geller What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!
phoebe_buffay I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.
monica_geller Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.
phoebe_buffay Here.
monica_geller And now your cell.
phoebe_buffay Okay
monica_geller This is your cellphone?
phoebe_buffay Yes.
monica_geller This is your current cellphone?
phoebe_buffay Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.
monica_geller Phoebe, where's your purse?
monica_geller No, no! Give it to me!
phoebe_buffay You can't have it.
monica_geller Give it to me!
phoebe_buffay No
monica_geller I'll go in there.
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah.
monica_geller Phoebe come here
monica_geller Haha!
phoebe_buffay Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
joey_tribbiani Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.
rachel_green Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.
joey_tribbiani No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!
rachel_green Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.
joey_tribbiani No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.
rachel_green Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...
joey_tribbiani Make the transfer!
rachel_green Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?
joey_tribbiani Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.
rachel_green Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.
joey_tribbiani But he's the same.
rachel_green Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.
joey_tribbiani But he's the same.
rachel_green Joey, come on!
joey_tribbiani He's the same!
joey_tribbiani You're not the same!
monica_geller Haha!
phoebe_buffay You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.
monica_geller So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.
phoebe_buffay Those are my shoes.
monica_geller Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.
phoebe_buffay Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.
monica_geller Who's that?
phoebe_buffay I ordered Chinese food.
phoebe_buffay What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?
monica_geller What are you doing here?
mike_hannigan Phoebe called me.
monica_geller Phoebe!
phoebe_buffay I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.
monica_geller Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
phoebe_buffay There is a speakerphone on the base unit...
monica_geller Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!
mike_hannigan Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see...
monica_geller This doesn't concern you!!
mike_hannigan Oh! Sorry, I guess I was thrown off by the mention of my name!
monica_geller Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.
phoebe_buffay Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?
monica_geller Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend
phoebe_buffay Sit down.
monica_geller Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!
mike_hannigan So how've you been?
monica_geller I've been pretty good!
mike_hannigan You look really beautiful.
phoebe_buffay Thanks, you look good too.
monica_geller Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!
phoebe_buffay So how's the piano playing going?
mike_hannigan Actually I've been playing a lot of love songs lately. I've missed you.
phoebe_buffay I've missed you too.
monica_geller You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!
chandler_bing Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize....don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?
dr_ross_geller uhu uhu, check this out.
chandler_bing Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?
dr_ross_geller Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?
chandler_bing No, come on, you know that's not true.
dr_ross_geller What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!
chandler_bing Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.
dr_ross_geller I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!
chandler_bing Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're deadThis is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.
dr_ross_geller You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
chandler_bing Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.
dr_ross_geller Exactly!!
chandler_bing Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?
dr_ross_geller No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!
chandler_bing Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !
dr_ross_geller oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...
rachel_green I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?
joey_tribbiani Original or crappy?
rachel_green Original.
joey_tribbiani No, sorry haven't seen him.
rachel_green Then what's that big lump under your covers?
joey_tribbiani It's Monica, ok?
rachel_green That's not Monica!
joey_tribbiani Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..
rachel_green Oh God.
joey_tribbiani .. she's being unreasonable!
rachel_green Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!
joey_tribbiani It does?
rachel_green Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
joey_tribbiani Really? She... she loves me?
rachel_green Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever
joey_tribbiani Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.
rachel_green Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!
joey_tribbiani Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.
rachel_green Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?
joey_tribbiani How do you think I got him in the first place?
monica_geller Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.
mike_hannigan I've missed you so much! No, I'm not gonna ask you to get back together because I know we want different things, but just to be with you one more night.
phoebe_buffay I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?
mike_hannigan It can't be any harder than this... I mean, If I had known the last time I saw you would be the last time, I... I would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you move, everything about you. If I had known the last time I kissed you would have been the last time... I never would have stopped.
monica_geller Kiss him, you fool!!
phoebe_buffay What?
monica_geller Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!
phoebe_buffay Oh, I missed you so much!
strange_man#unknown#Friends.Season09.Episode17 I knew you'd be here!
mike_hannigan Oh, crap!
phoebe_buffay Who is this?
mike_hannigan My friend Manny. I asked him to keep me away from you.
monica_geller Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!
manny Well, you are not doing a very good job!
monica_geller Excuse me?
manny What's with the kissing?
monica_geller Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
manny Oh yeah yeah, thank God you were here to oversee all the kissing!
monica_geller You didn't hear the speech!
manny I've heard the speech: "if he knew it was gonna be the last time he saw her... "
monica_geller Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!
manny You're weak!
monica_geller You're... weird!
manny Your pants are undone!
monica_geller Oh !
manny Where did they go?
monica_geller Damn it!
manny Oh we blew it. I blame myself.
monica_geller And I blame you too.
dr_ross_geller It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!
chandler_bing There you go! Someone came!
dr_ross_geller Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!
monica_geller Hi, glad you could come.
chandler_bing Please, come in.
tom_gordon Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class.
chandler_bing Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.
tom_gordon Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's...
chandler_bing At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps
dr_ross_geller Who is he?
chandler_bing Some guy, Tom Gordon.
dr_ross_geller I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.
monica_geller So, did you know Ross well?
tom_gordon Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?
monica_geller Yes, he is. Me.
tom_gordon What? You... You... Oh! Can I ask you a personal question? Ho-how do you shave your beard so close?
chandler_bing Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!
tom_gordon Hey, listen. Call me.
chandler_bing Ok!
dr_ross_geller I'm dead and no one cares?
monica_geller I look like a man??
chandler_bing Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!
dr_ross_geller It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!
chandler_bing You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!
dr_ross_geller Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?
chandler_bing Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?
dr_ross_geller Yeah...
chandler_bing I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.
kori_weston Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
chandler_bing Kori? Kori Weston?
kori_weston Yeah...
chandler_bing Wow! You look amazing!
kori_weston And you are...
chandler_bing Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.
monica_geller You are married though.
chandler_bing Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!
kori_weston I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
chandler_bing I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
kori_weston We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
chandler_bing I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.
kori_weston I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out. I guess I really missed my chance.
dr_ross_geller But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!
kori_weston You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on you!
dr_ross_geller Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
dr_ross_geller No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?
