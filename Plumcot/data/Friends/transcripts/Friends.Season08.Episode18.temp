phoebe Oh, Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone to your parent's anniversary party?
monica Yeah.
ross Sure. Yeah.
joey So, who's the guy?
phoebe Well, his name is Parker and I met him at the drycleaners.
chandler Oooh, did he put a little starch in your bloomers? Who said that?
phoebe Yeah, he's really great though. He has this incredible zest for life, and he treats me like a queen, except at night when he treats me like the naughty girl I am.
monica Oh, by the way. Would it be okay if I gave the toast to mom and dad this year?
ross Uh, yeah, you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?
monica Yeah, I'd really like to.
ross Okay, hopefully this time mom won't boo you.
monica Yes! Every year Ross makes the toast, and it's always really moving, and always makes them cry. Well this year I'm going to make them cry.
chandler And you wonder why Ross is their favorite?
monica No! Really! Any time Ross makes a toast everyone cries, and hugs him, and pats him on the back and they all come up to me and say, "God, your brother." Know what they'll say this year? "God, you"
joey Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.
monica Really you can do that?
joey Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!
chandler What are you doing?
monica Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.
chandler It's a dog.
monica It's a dead dog. That's Chi-Chi; she died when I was in high school.
chandler It's your parents' anniversary and you're going to talk about their dead pet?
monica The good stuff, huh?
rachel Hi!
ross Hey!
joey Hey!
monica You got a present for my parents. That's so sweet.
joey Yeah, yeah, in honor of their 35th wedding anniversary, I had a star named after them.
ross Aww that is so cool.
joey And I got them a book on Karma Sutra for the elderly.
rachel Hey, do you guys have any extra ribbon?
chandler Yeah, sure. What do you need? We got lace, satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt, and I think my testacles may be in here too.
ross Aww! Chi-Chi! Oh, I loved this dog! Y'know Monica couldn't get braces because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.
monica What?!
ross You were the 200-pound 11-year-old who rode her!
phoebe Hey!
all Hi!
phoebe Everybody, this is Parker, Parker this is
parker No, no, no wait! Don't tell me. Let me guess. Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel and, I'm sorry Phoebe didn't mention you. Chandler, I'm kidding all ready you're my favorite!
chandler Ha!
parker Why don't all of you tell me a little about your self?
ross Ah, actually, I'm sorry we-we probably should get going.
parker Classic Ross. Rachel, Rachel, oh how you glow. May I?
rachel I, uh, think you already are.
parker Rachel, you have life growing inside you. Is there anything in this world more miraculous than-Oh a picture of a dog! Whose is this?
monica That's my old dog. He passed away years ago.
parker Oh well, at least you were lucky to have him. Bow-wow old friend, bow-wow. So where's the party?
monica It's out on the island. It's in Massapequa.
parker Maaaassapequa, sounds like a magical place. Tell me about Massapequa, is it steep in Native American history? {Transcriber's Note: Interestingly Alec Baldwin was born in Massapequa.}
ross Well, there is an Arby's in the shape of a tee-pee.
monica Okay, I got my note cards. Do you got the presents?
chandler Yeah.
monica And I've got the car keys.
parker We're driving!?
monica Yeah.
parker Aces!
ross So uh, he seems like a nice guy.
rachel Yeah, yeah I like him a lot.
ross Ya wanna hang back and take our own cab?
rachel Yeah, otherwise I'm not going.
mr_and_mrs_geller Hi
ross Hi! Hey mom.
rachel This is such a great party! 35 years. Very impressive, do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?
mrs_geller Jack?
mr_geller Why would you serve food on such a sharp stick?
ross That's a good question, dad. That's a good question
rachel Hmmm....
woman Congratulations you two!
rachel Thank you...we're so excited
woman And also, congratulations on your wedding.
ross Wha-What?
mrs_geller Can we talk to you for just a y'know... It's just a little thing. Well we think it's absolutely marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock, some of our friends are less open-minded. Which is why we've told them all that you're married.
ross_and_rachel What?!
mrs_geller Thanks for going along with this.
ross Dad so what we have to pretend that we're married?
mr_geller Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight. You can do this.
ross Can you believe that?
rachel Yeah, if you're going to do the ears, you might as well take a pass at the nosal area.
ross No, us having to lie about being married.
rachel No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just...smile. We'll nod along.
woman Ross!
man Rachel!
ross Hi Aunt Lisa, Uncle Dan
aunt_lisa Congratulations on the baby, and on the wedding
ross_and_rachel Hmmmm....
uncle_dan Here's a little something to get you started.
rachel Oh
aunt_lisa So, how's married life treating you?
rachel Unbelievable!
ross We love marriage!
aunt_lisa Great!
ross Hey
phoebe Hey!
parker What a beautiful place. What a great night! I have to tell you, being here with all of you in Event Room C...I feel so lucky. I think of all the good times that have happened here. The birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs both bar and bat, but none of them will compare with tonight! My God, I don't want to forget this moment! It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all! Click!
chandler I don't think the flash went off.
parker Dahaaa! I'm going to find the men's room, be right back.
phoebe I'll go with you
parker Come on!
chandler Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.
joey I have to go to the bathroom too, but I don't want him complimenting my thing.
ross I'm so we weren't in the car! Did he ever let up?
monica He called the Long Island Expressway a concrete miracle.
ross This room! This night! That waiter! His shoes! I must take a mental picture! Ooh sorry
phoebe Were you guys making fun of Parker?
ross That depends, how much did you hear?
phoebe So, he a little enthusiastic, what's wrong with that?
monica It's just that, it's so much.
phoebe Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.
monica I feel terrible.
joey I know
ross What was wrong with Mona?
rachel Open it! Open it! Open it!
ross Yeah baby!
man So we never got to hear about your wedding!
woman We were surprise that we weren't invited.
ross No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.
rachel But it was beautiful. I mean it was small, but kind of spectacular.
man Where did you have it?
rachel On a cliff, in Barbados, at sunset, and Stevie Wonder sang Isn't She Lovely as I walked down the aisle.
woman Really?
rachel Yeah, Stevie's an old family friend.
woman Oh my God. That sounds amazing. I would love to see pictures.
rachel So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.
ross Would you excuse us for a second? Umm.... what are you doing?
rachel What? I'm not you. This may be the only wedding I ever have. I want it to be amazing.
ross Okay, okay. Ooooh, ooh maybe I rode in on a Harley.
rachel Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.
parker Are you okay? You seem kind of quiet.
phoebe No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
parker And I'm with you! What a great time to be alive! Look at this plate-bouncy thing. What an inspired solution to man's plate dispensing problems.
phoebe Hm huh, yeah.
parker Ah! Oysters! Let me feed you one.
phoebe No, that's not necessary.
parker Please.
phoebe No, actually I don't eat
parker I won't quit until you try.
phoebe Okay, fine! Fine! Mmm...hmmmmm....
parker What are they like? I've never had one.
phoebe Why don't you just try one?
parker No, they look too weird.
chandler What are you doin'?
monica Just going over my toast. Those two will never know what hit 'em. I can't wait. They're going to be crying so hard. They're going to be fighting for breath.
chandler Ya know if you want to, I can just hold them down and you could
rachel And my veil was lace, made by blind, Belgium nuns.
woman Blind?
rachel Well, not at first, but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.
aunt_lisa I'll bet you looked beautiful
rachel Well, I don't know about that, but some said that I looked like a floating angel.
woman So, how did you propose?
rachel Oh yeah. That's a great story.
ross Well, um, actually, I-I took her to the planetarium. That's-that's where we had our first date. Um, she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies, her favorite flower
aunt_lisa Oh that is so sweet!
rachel Shhh! I want to hear the rest!
ross Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words "Will you marry me?"
rachel And the ring, was the size of my fist !
joey Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.
phoebe Then you better do it now.
joey Why?
phoebe Because I'm going to kill him
joey What-what?
phoebe You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.
joey I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!
phoebe Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?
joey I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.
phoebe He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.
joey Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.
phoebe You think?
joey Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.
phoebe You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.
joey Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
phoebe What's that now?
joey Nothing
phoebe Oh look it's Parker!
parker Look! It's the bunny hop!
phoebe Oooh I love it!
parker You do?!
phoebe Are you kidding? People acting like animals to music. Come on!
monica Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.
monica No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!
mrs_geller Thank you Monica that was uh, interesting. Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
mr_geller Why don't I remember this dog?
mrs_geller Ross, why don't you give us your toast now?
ross Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.
mrs_geller You're not going to say anything? On our 35th wedding anniversary
ross No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.
mrs_geller Oh Ross
mr_geller I just wish Nana were alive to hear Ross's toast.
parker My God what a fantastically well lit hallway!
phoebe Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?
parker I must say this apartment, its, its, There are no words
phoebe Oh thank God.
parker It's a haven. A third-floor paradise. A modern-day Eden in the midst
phoebe Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!
parker That sounds great. My God this is the most comfortable couch I've ever sat on in my entire life.
phoebe Let's try something else, let's play a game.
parker I love games!
phoebe Shocking! Let's play the game of who can stay quiet the longest.
parker Or...Jenga.
phoebe But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!
parker I lose, now Jenga.
phoebe Oh my God! Oh my God!
parker Is something wrong?
phoebe Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!
parker Well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam!
phoebe You don't have to put a good spin on everything.
parker I'm sorry that's who I am. I'm a positive person.
phoebe No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!
parker So what do you want me to do, you want me to be more negative, less happy?
phoebe Much less happy!
parker Fine! Well then to quote Ross, "I'd better be going."
phoebe So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!
parker Isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?
phoebe Uh huh.
ross ...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!
rachel Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.
ross But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
rachel It was really fun being married to you tonight.
ross Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.
rachel Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?
ross Yeah.
rachel That proposal, at the planetarium
ross I know, I know it was stupid.
rachel Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?
ross No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.
rachel Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.
ross It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night
rachel Goodnight
ross Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
rachel I will think about it.
ross That's all I'm askin'
monica Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.
ross Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.
monica Oh, come on.
ross Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.
monica Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?
