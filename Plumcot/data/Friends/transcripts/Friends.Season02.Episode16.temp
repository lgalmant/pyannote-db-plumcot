joey Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
chandler That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a
chandler Waaa-aaah.
joey What?
chandler The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
joey Yeah, so.
chandler Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush?
joey Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.
chandler Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere.
joey Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?
chandler Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
joey Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.
chandler Hey.
monica_and_phoebe Hey.
joey Hey.
phoebe Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?
joey Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch.
phoebe Ahh.
rachel OK, ready when you are.
phoebe Okey-doke.
monica I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
chandler Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?
rachel Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.
joey Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?
phoebe Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily.
chandler Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?
joey So where you gettin' it?
phoebe I think on my shoulder.
ross What? What's on your shoulder?
phoebe Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo.
ross A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi.
rachel Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?
ross No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?
monica Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute.
chandler Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?
monica Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there.
joey Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?
monica Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.
phoebe No, I think you should tell them.
monica No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything.
ross I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'
ross Alright, shall we?
monica OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up.
ross Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it. We're here.
mrs_geller Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
monica Happy birthday dad.
mr_geller Oh thank you.
ross Hi ma.
richard Happy birthday.
mrs_geller Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?
ross Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.
friend Well, you kids take the train in?
mrs_geller No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.
friend Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.
monica Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom.
mrs_geller Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section.
monica Are we still on that?
mrs_geller We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
friend She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.
joey Can you believe this place?
chandler I know, this is a great apartment.
joey Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes.
chandler Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously.
joeys_costar Hey.
joey Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man.
joeys_costar Thanks. You want it?
joey Huh?
joeys_costar Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one.
joey Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?
joeys_costar Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
chandler Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK.
mr_geller C'mon, tell us.
friend Yeah, is she really 20.
richard I am not telling you guys anything.
mr_geller C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously.
ross Dad, you really don't want to do that.
mr_geller Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?
richard Jack, would you let it go?
mr_geller Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster.
richard Guys. Seriously, it is
mr_geller Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou.
ross Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence.
mr_geller What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
phoebe OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?
rachel Well I.
phoebe I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh.
tattoo_artist Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me.
phoebe Here we go.
rachel Uh-huh.
phoebe You're not going?
rachel Uh-huh.
phoebe What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
rachel No. Well, yeah, maybe.
phoebe I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?
rachel What's 1922?
phoebe Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?
rachel Yes I do, it's just that Ross is.
phoebe OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?
rachel No.
phoebe OK, who is the boss of you?!!
rachel You?
phoebe No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip.
richard How ya doin'?
monica I'm a twinkie.
richard Really? I'm a hero.
monica Oh, this is so hard.
richard Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them.
monica Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
richard My parents are dead.
monica God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. you know what I mean.
richard I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright.
monica Alright.
richard Judy,
mrs_geller Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support.
mr_geller Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one.
mrs_geller I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
mr_geller I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from
mrs_geller I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
mr_geller Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.
mrs_geller Really.
mr_geller I tell you, I've never seen him this happy.
mrs_geller So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?
mr_geller Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
mrs_geller Oh Jack stop.
mr_geller C'mon, it's my birthday.
joey Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
chandler Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it.
joey Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love.
chandler Well it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.
joey Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it.
chandler What?
joey I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.
chandler Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.
joey What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie.
chandler Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.
joey Well that's how I feel.
chandler Well then maybe you should take it.
joey Well then maybe I will.
chandler Fine with me.
joey Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons.
mr_geller Who's drink can I freshen?
mrs_geller Almost time for cake.
ross Mon, Mon, are you OK?
monica You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
ross Yeah.
monica Well, I just caught the live show.
ross Eww.
monica Hey there.
richard What?
monica Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.
richard Humm, really?
mrs_geller Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
richard Uhh, not that I know of.
mrs_geller Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?
richard That - that's an idea.
monica Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.
mrs_geller Oh?
richard Oh?
ross Ohh.
mrs_geller She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?
ross Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?
mrs_geller So, who's the mystery man?
monica Well, uh, he's a doctor.
mrs_geller A real doctor?
monica No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him.
mrs_geller Well that's wonderful. I
monica Mom, it's OK.
richard It is Judy.
mrs_geller Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
mr_geller Found it.
ross I'll take that dad.
mrs_geller It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
mr_geller That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.
monica Dad, I'm the twinkie.
mr_geller You're the twinkie?
richard She's not a twinkie.
monica Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in.
mrs_geller Oh please, a relationship.
monica Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.
richard Really?
monica Yes.
mr_geller Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
monica Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.
mr_geller When did I say that?
monica Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
phoebe Oh that looks so good, oh I love it.
rachel I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours.
phoebe Ahh. OK, let's see yours again.

phoebe Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went.
rachel You didn't get it?
phoebe No.
rachel Why didn't you get it?
phoebe I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
rachel Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea.
phoebe I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?
rachel Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens.

joey Plastic spoons. Great.
chandler Lick away my man.
joey These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.
chandler What?
joey Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.
chandler No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?
joey I'm movin' out like we talked about.
chandler Well I didn't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
joey Well, it was a fight. based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. whatever.
chandler Well, there you go.
joey Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry.
chandler Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.
joey Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
chandler I did pay for half of it.
joey Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.
chandler Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.
joey Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.
chandler Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
joey Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?
monica So, are you sorry that I told them?
richard No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running.

phoebe OK, well then what is this?
richard What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
phoebe OK, that's my tattoo.
rachel That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it.
phoebe OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.
rachel Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo.
ross You got a tattoo?

rachel Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?
joey Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street.
chandler Yeah, I remember.
ross Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.
chandler So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?
