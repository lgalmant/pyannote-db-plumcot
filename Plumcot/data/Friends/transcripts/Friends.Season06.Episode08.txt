joey_tribbiani Hey.
chandler_bing Hi, my name's Chandler. I just moved in next door and I was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post-apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source?
joey_tribbiani Sure, neighbor come on in.
chandler_bing So, is Janine around?
joey_tribbiani Uh, no, she's at dance class.
chandler_bing Can I check out what she did to my room?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, but, hey look, don't go through her stuff. She gets really mad.
chandler_bing Oh my God. What is th... it's like a guy never lived in here. Look, you've got to be careful. This girl thing is dangerous. It's spreading already.
joey_tribbiani It is???
chandler_bing Yeah, is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?
joey_tribbiani No.
chandler_bing Is that your tiny little box, that's too small to put anything in?
joey_tribbiani No.
chandler_bing No! Ok, this is not good. You are a guy. Ok? This is a guys place. If you let this go, you're going to be sitting around with your fingers soaking in stuff.
joey_tribbiani All right, you're right. I'll talk to her.
chandler_bing Yes talk to her. Be a man.
joey_tribbiani I'm a man.
chandler_bing Defend yourself.
joey_tribbiani Hmm.
monica_geller Chandler come on. We have to hem the new dust ruffle.
chandler_bing Be right there sweetums. A totally different situation.
monica_geller Hey guys.
chandler_bing Hey, how was your breakfast with Hillary?
monica_geller It was okay. She's still kind of depressed because she broke up with her boyfriend.
chandler_bing Ohh, yeah.
dr_ross_geller Well, is this Hillary your HOT assistant chef Hillary?
monica_geller Yeah.
dr_ross_geller The one that always stares at me when I come in?
monica_geller No, the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.
dr_ross_geller Still I could tell. She was into me. Well, why don't you set us up?
rachel_green Ohh, are you setting Ross up with someone? Does she have a wedding dress?
phoebe_buffay Hey.
rachel_green Hey.
phoebe_buffay Rachel?
rachel_green Yeah.
phoebe_buffay I'm, uhh, making up flyers trying to get new massage clients. So, can I come to Bloomingdale's and use the copy machine.
rachel_green Well, sure, but they might think it's kinda weird considering I don't work there anymore.
phoebe_buffay Oh my God. What happened?
rachel_green I-I, got a job at Ralph Lauren.
phoebe_buffay Well that's great! Congratulations!!
rachel_green Yeah. A year ago..
phoebe_buffay You've lasted a whole year. Good for you.
rachel_green But, Pheebs, you can still use the copy machine where I actually work. But, just come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you. Cause Kim will just freak out and she already doesn't like me very much.
chandler_bing That's weird. I don't think my boss likes me either.
monica_geller I don't think mine likes me either.
dr_ross_geller Maybe it's a universal thing?
joey_tribbiani Or maybe, it's because you're hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.
chandler_bing Yeah let's head off to work.
monica_geller We should go.
phoebe_buffay Thank you.
rachel_green Sure.
phoebe_buffay Now you will not believe this. But, I was in the copy room, making copies, and Ralph Lauren came in.
rachel_green Oh my God. Did you talk to him?
phoebe_buffay Yeah a little. He seems really nice. Good kisser.
rachel_green What? What!?! You kissed him?
phoebe_buffay Totally.
rachel_green Phoebe are you serious?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. I was just in there. He introduced himself and the next thing I know, we're making out. You know.
rachel_green Phoebe, I mean, you do know he's married?
phoebe_buffay No!
rachel_green Phoebe
phoebe_buffay What am I supposed to do? Ask every guy I make out with if he's married? No, yeah, I should.
janine_lecroix Hey Joey.
joey_tribbiani Hey. Uh, can I talk to you for a second? This, uh, kid in this picture. Do you, uh, know this kid? Is that like a relative or something?
janine_lecroix No, I just thought it was cute.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.. Okay, uhh...Look Janine I really want you to feel at home here, but some of this new stuff. It's...too girly.
janine_lecroix Ohh. Like what?
joey_tribbiani Like this. Pictures of cute babies we don't know. We..we can't have that.
janine_lecroix Joey, it's Anne Geddes. She's a famous artist.
joey_tribbiani Look I don't know this baby. I don't know if she's a famous artist or not. You know, and I don't want to be a jerk but you're changing too much around here.
janine_lecroix Well, I'm sorry. I just thought I'd try to make the place a little nicer.
joey_tribbiani Yeah but it's too much stuff. You know like, you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can.
janine_lecroix Well I just thought
joey_tribbiani I'm sure it's a famous watering can, okay. But, come on...and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?
janine_lecroix It's a curling iron.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, well, that's ok then. But, okay my towels for instance. I come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it. It's up here on some hook..and...smells different.
janine_lecroix It's clean.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, well, it feels different.
janine_lecroix It's dry.
joey_tribbiani Alright, I can make my peace with the clean dry towels...Also what is with these chips you bought?
janine_lecroix No no no no, it's potpourri. You're supposed to smell it.
joey_tribbiani Well that's like summer in a bowl.
rachel_green Oh, Kim, Hi.
kim_clozzi Uhh-huh.
rachel_green So you know, I...I handed in that marketing report and I never got to hear what you thought.
kim_clozzi I didn't read it.
rachel_green Ahh....So...Wow...The spring line, it's really going to be great this year, huh?
kim_clozzi Yeah.
rachel_green So I hear the Ralph Lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room.
kim_clozzi Tell me everything.
dr_ross_geller Hey guys.
chandler_bing@monica_geller Hey.
dr_ross_geller What's up?
chandler_bing You know...Oh My God.
monica_geller What happened to your teeth.
dr_ross_geller I whitened them.
chandler_bing Really.
dr_ross_geller Yeah. What do you think.
monica_geller Well, I think I shouldn't look directly at them.
dr_ross_geller Come on, seriously.
monica_geller Ross they're really, really, really white.
chandler_bing Yeah, what was wrong with your old...human teeth.
dr_ross_geller Ahh, I-I did leave the gel on a little longer then it said to.
monica_geller How much longer?
dr_ross_geller A-A day.
monica_geller Ross you know that tonight is your date with Hillary?
dr_ross_geller I know. That's why I did it. Come on, are they really that bad?
chandler_bing No, no no no. You'll be fine. Hillary's bind, right?
monica_geller She will be after tonight.
chandler_bing Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Oh, hey, hey Rach, do you notice anything..ahh
rachel_green Yeah. Your teeth? Yes, I saw them from outside. You guys are never going to believe this. But, Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren.
chandler_bing What???
monica_geller Oh my god.
rachel_green Yeah I know. She ran into him at my office and they just...made out. And the craziest thing is, now my boss likes me because I told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she'd heard all year.
chandler_bing I am proud of all my friends today.
monica_geller My God, Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe made out with Ralph Lauren. Ohh, I'm so jealous.
chandler_bing Hi, I'm Chandler. Your live-in boy
monica_geller Chandler, please, come on. Look at him.
chandler_bing Oh, I am no women, but that is one tasty dish.
phoebe_buffay Hey. Here. Ohh, who's the silver fox?
rachel_green That-that is your make out buddy. Don't you recognize him? Oh wait. Ohh, Phoebe I love you. Kiss me please.
phoebe_buffay That's not Ralph Lauren. Sounds like him though.
rachel_green What?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look anything like that guy. He's-he's young and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack.
rachel_green Oh My God, Phoebe, that's not Ralph Lauren. That's Kenny the copy guy.
phoebe_buffay What?
rachel_green Oh..Go..Oh..and I told my boss that someone made out with Ralph Lauren. If she finds out that I lied to her, she is going to hate me even more. Phoebe!!
phoebe_buffay Why would the copy guy say he was Ralph Lauren?
rachel_green To get you to make out with him!!!
phoebe_buffay Ohhh.
monica_geller Okay, maybe this will make your teeth look less white. Nope. Okay, colors that don't work are blue, yellow, green, red, black, white, orange, and purple.
dr_ross_geller I don't know what I'm going to do. That date starts in like an hour.
monica_geller Hey Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter. Your teeth wouldn't look so bright.
dr_ross_geller Oh great. So all I need to do is get some new skin. Thank you.
monica_geller I'm just saying, if we put just a little bit of makeup on you.
dr_ross_geller Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. We're not 13 anymore.
monica_geller Ross this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.
dr_ross_geller But, won't she notice I have makeup on?
monica_geller Please. Half the guys out there have makeup on.
dr_ross_geller What??
monica_geller All right, half the people. I mean, just try it and see.
dr_ross_geller No. I am not putting on makeup.
phoebe_buffay Hello. Oh good. Ross could you put up some of these flyers for me? OH!! Demon!! Demon!!
monica_geller Now are drawers will smell nice and we didn't waste these pantyhose.
chandler_bing Yes, God forbid we throw out old underwear. You-you know what? I'm going to go over to Joey's.
monica_geller Wait, we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper drawer.
chandler_bing Yes, but I feel like I've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today. You know. In fact I think we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.
monica_geller You know what? This has been kind of a girlie day. You're right, I'm sorry.
chandler_bing Nah, Nah, it's okay. I feel like I need to be in guy place. You know, do kind of like a man thing.
monica_geller Yeah. Go over to Joey's. Go over to Joey's and drink some beer and hammer up some drywall.
chandler_bing You know when guys hang out they don't just drink some beer and hammer up drywall?
monica_geller When girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear. I'm sorry. We do. We do. I don't know why I said that.
joey_tribbiani Hey Chandler. Come on in. We're knitting pot holders.
chandler_bing No thanks, Josephine.
chandler_bing Hey Ross, I was wondering if... Oh my God!! Where are all the men???
rachel_green Ohh, hi, Kim.
kim_clozzi Hi Rachel.
rachel_green Yeah, remember that thing I told you that happened yesterday? Well it didn't happen.
kim_clozzi You didn't cancel the fabric order from Taiwan?
rachel_green Okay, two things didn't happen. Remember I told you that someone made out with Ralph Lauren in the copy room? Well, it turns out that's not true.
kim_clozzi That's not true?
rachel_green No.
kim_clozzi Oh that's interesting? Because I checked and only one keycard was used to access the copy machine yesterday during lunch and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
rachel_green Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.
kim_clozzi Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.
rachel_green I-I don't want your job. I-I don't. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I don't even know how to use my keycard.
kim_clozzi Hi Ralph.
ralph_lauren#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode08 : Hi Kim.
kim_clozzi Yeah, nothing happen. You could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.
hillary And after that, what could I do except become a chef.
dr_ross_geller Mmm-Hmm.
hillary And someday soon, I hope to open my own restaurant.
dr_ross_geller Mmm.
hillary You know, you're a really great listener. Most guys I go out with, they just talk and talk.
dr_ross_geller Mm-Hmm.
hillary After a while it's like, shut your mouth, you know?
dr_ross_geller Hmm-Hmm.
hillary I've probably been talking too much. Why don't we talk about you a little bit?
dr_ross_geller Mmm-Unmm.
hillary Come on. I want to know.
dr_ross_geller Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Okay. I, uh, am from Long Island. I-I came to the city for college. Um, I, um, have a 5 year old son and in my spare time I like to read spy novels. But, but, let's talk more about you. Hmm.
joey_tribbiani So what's really neat. If you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan, your arrangement will look fresh much longer.
monica_geller Oh my God, Joey, that is such a great tip.
chandler_bing Monica, could you excuse us for a second? I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
monica_geller Okay. Oh but Joey, come over later because I'm going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter.
joey_tribbiani Ohh, I love birds.
chandler_bing What is the matter with you ?!?
joey_tribbiani What?
chandler_bing You're arranging flowers! You got dead flowers! You got a picture, a picture, of a baby dressed like flowers! This is not Joey!!
joey_tribbiani Hey. Hey look I am still Joey, okay. Flowers they're just, you know, they're nice to look at. And that happens to be a picture by a famous artist. Of a famous baby.
chandler_bing You're turning into a women.
joey_tribbiani No I'm not. Why would you say that? That's just mean.
chandler_bing Now I've upset you? What did I say?
joey_tribbiani It's not what you said. It's the way you said it....Oh My God, I'm a women!!!
rachel_green Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.
phoebe_buffay But why didn't you just tell her the truth.
rachel_green I did but she doesn't think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
phoebe_buffay Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?
rachel_green You were with Kenny today, weren't you?
phoebe_buffay Just for a second.
rachel_green Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?
phoebe_buffay Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.
rachel_green I'm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, sleep with Kenny.
rachel_green That wouldn't help me.
phoebe_buffay Ohh, yes it would.
hillary I've had a really good time tonight.
dr_ross_geller Mmm.
hillary You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.
dr_ross_geller Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. Me, neither. I've had a really good time too, you know.
hillary Are you going to eat that bread?
dr_ross_geller Ohh, I just like the smell. Mmmm.
hillary You make me laugh.
dr_ross_geller Hmm-Hmm.
hillary Would you like to move over to the couch?
dr_ross_geller Mmm-Hmm.
hillary Maybe I'll just turn the lights down a little.
dr_ross_geller How about all the way.
hillary Okay.
dr_ross_geller Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? So, ahh, where were we?
hillary Are those your teeth??
dr_ross_geller Ohh, you can see them, huh?
hillary Yes. They're insanely white.
dr_ross_geller I-I, did that for you.
hillary What's a matter with you?
dr_ross_geller What's a matter with me? You've got a black light. It's 1999!
rachel_green Kim, hi.
kim_clozzi Hi Rachel. Ohh, I've been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.
rachel_green Okay..Okay.. Look. I'm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.
kim_clozzi Oh, really?
rachel_green Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I can't do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I can't do this. I'm married and I'm sorry." And then I don't know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."
kim_clozzi You expect me to believe.. Hi Ralph.
ralph_lauren#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode08 : Hi Kim.
kim_clozzi Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. It's like he hates you. Then it is true.
rachel_green Of course it's true and it hurts so bad.
kim_clozzi Ohh honey come here. Ohh it will be ok. We've all been there.
rachel_green You and Ralph?
kim_clozzi Kenny the copyboy.
janine_lecroix Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.
janine_lecroix What's the matter? Are you upset?
joey_tribbiani I'm sorry but we've got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? That's just the way it has to be.
janine_lecroix Well, if that's what you want. I'll just put it all in my room.
joey_tribbiani Great...Great...and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didn't want to make a big deal out of this, you know. You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.
janine_lecroix Okay.
joey_tribbiani And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.
janine_lecroix Sure.
joey_tribbiani And a couple of these little tiny boxes.
janine_lecroix Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?
joey_tribbiani Okay.
