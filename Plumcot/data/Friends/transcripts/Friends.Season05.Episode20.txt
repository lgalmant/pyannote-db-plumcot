monica_geller Okay, guys, listen, don't forget that tomorrow is the day that Emily gets married again, so whatever we do, just try to really keep Ross's mind off of it.
joey_tribbiani Oh, yeah, good idea.
chandler_bing Hey man, what's up?
dr_ross_geller Oh, eh, just thinking about Emily getting married tomorrow.

phoebe_buffay Hey!
gary Hello!
monica_geller Hey!
gary How are you?
phoebe_buffay Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary; he let me ride around with him in his cop car. We saw and prevented crimes.

chandler_bing Tonight? You-you didn't say it was going to be at nighttime.
rachel_green Hey!
monica_geller Hey! Oh, I'm so glad you're home, I thought tonight we could finally organize these photos!
rachel_green Ohh, thank God! Finally!
monica_geller Okay, I've broken them down into categories. Okay, we have uh, we got holidays, birthdays, candids, y'know... And then what I've done is I've cross-referenced them by subject. Right? So if you're looking up, oh let's say birthdays and dogs, you get Photo 152. See?
rachel_green Ohh, it's me and La Poo! Wow! I miss that dog.
monica_geller You can also find him under umm, dog and dead.
rachel_green Great! Thanks!
monica_geller All right, hand me that other box of photos; that's the very last one.
rachel_green Okay.
rachel_green Oops. Sorry! Well, good thing you number all of them, huh?
monica_geller I hadn't! Photo 152 was a prototype.
rachel_green Ohhhh. Honey, honey, honey, it's okay, it's okay honey. I'm gonna fix you a drink, huh? Maybe a margarita?
dr_ross_geller Ross has the blender! Ugh, everything's just falling apart!
rachel_green No honey, it's okay! Listen, I'll got to Ross's and get the blender, you get all the margarita stuff ready.
monica_geller All right, he's keys are in the drawer. Y'know what? I also need some cash.
rachel_green Okay, you want me to stop at the ATM?
monica_geller Nah, while you're at Ross's if you see any lying around
rachel_green What?!
monica_geller What?! I-I-I don't, I don't do that!
dr_ross_geller That was so cool man, the way you leaned on that guy.
chandler_bing It is starting to get dark out there.
dr_ross_geller He told you everything! I mean you totally cracked him!
gary Yeah well, being that he was the victim, they're usually pretty talkative.
chandler_bing Okay. But it is officially nighttime.
dr_ross_geller Oh hey, Gary, want me to grab the berry for ya?
gary It's called the cherry.
dr_ross_geller It's the-Chandler!!
joey_tribbiani Okay, I got it! This place makes the best sandwich in the world!
gary Hey Joe does it have meatballs on it?
joey_tribbiani Oh-ho, yeah!
gary Does it have melted cheese and marinara sauce?
joey_tribbiani Yep!
gary Yeah, you can't eat that in my car.
joey_tribbiani Yeah okay. Even though my tax dollars paid for this car.
chandler_bing Your tax dollars?
joey_tribbiani Yeah, okay.
chandler_bing Wow! That sandwich really does smell good.
joey_tribbiani Did I say you could smell it?!
chandler_bing I can't smell your sandwich?
joey_tribbiani Half the taste is in the smell! You-you're sucking up all the tastiness!
chandler_bing Okay, I'll give them back. Look! What is so great about that sandwich?
joey_tribbiani Okay, imagine the best sex you've ever had.
chandler_bing Okay.
joey_tribbiani Are you thinking about Monica?
chandler_bing Yeah.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, what's that like?
rachel_green Ohh please don't be from a real dinosaur! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please! Made in Mexico! Yes!! Ugh, who would buy this?!
monica_geller Rach! It's me! Pick up!
rachel_green Hey! What's up?!
monica_geller I need a few more things to make the margaritas. Uhh, I need some salt, some margarita mix, and tequila.
rachel_green So all we have is ice?
monica_geller See if he has ice.
rachel_green Okay.
emily_waltham Hello Ross? It's Emily. I know this is out of the blue but uh, I'm getting married tomorrow. Well, maybe I am. I keep thinking about you and I'm wondering if-if we made a mistake giving up so fast. Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
rachel_green Oh. Oh!
dr_ross_geller So where are we going next?
gary This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
chandler_bing Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?
joey_tribbiani Come on man! Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?
gary It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, no one talks like that!
joey_tribbiani Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
dr_ross_geller Hey, I'm more cop than you two!
chandler_bing How do you figure that?
dr_ross_geller Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!
chandler_bing Y'know, when you say partner it doesn't sound cop. It, it sounds gay.
dr_ross_geller Umm, jealous!
gary Hey, do you mind? We're under cover here.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, no problem.
gary Ross!
dr_ross_geller Sorry! Sorry! Oh, there! Hey Gary, who am I? Phone home!
chandler_bing Look at Officer Ross riding back here with the visitors.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, what's up with that Serpico?
emily_waltham Are you thinking about me? Of course you're not, but if you are, call me tonight. Okay, bye.
monica_geller Nooo!
rachel_green I know!
monica_geller Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!
rachel_green What?! We can't do that!
monica_geller We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?
rachel_green Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!
monica_geller I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?
rachel_green I don't think he's the one who needs help.
monica_geller No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.
rachel_green Ugh!
monica_geller Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.
rachel_green Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!
answering_machine#unknown#Friends.Season05.Episode20 Your messages have been erased.
rachel_green Noooooooo!
chandler_bing Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!
gary No. But that reminds me, sign this.
dr_ross_geller What is it?
gary Oh it's nothing, it just says that you can't sue the city if you scrap your knee or y'know, get your head blown off.
chandler_bing Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.
gary Okay, here he comes. What is he doing? What the hell is he doing?!
dr_ross_geller What? What? What? What is it?
joey_tribbiani Is everything okay?
chandler_bing What's going on?
gary Okay, he sees us. Now don't move. Don't look at him.
gary Hey, it's okay. It was just a car backfire. Hey, look at that! You tried to save your buddy. You see that? You see what he did?
joey_tribbiani You okay man?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. Thank Joey!
chandler_bing Uh, HELLO!!
joey_tribbiani Hi.
monica_geller All right, I guess we should go.
rachel_green No, wait. Wait.
monica_geller Oh yeah right!
rachel_green No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!
monica_geller There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!
rachel_green Yeah well unless we tell him.
monica_geller Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.
rachel_green Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.
dr_ross_geller Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!
monica_geller Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!
rachel_green Right?
gary Hey, anybody want to meet a hero?
phoebe_buffay John Glenn is here?!
gary No, Joey!
dr_ross_geller Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car
gary Wait! Hold on! Hi!
phoebe_buffay Hi!
gary Okay, go ahead.
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!
phoebe_buffay My God, Joey!
chandler_bing It was a car backfire!
dr_ross_geller Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!
joey_tribbiani Yeah, I didn't know that.
dr_ross_geller And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.
gary Hey Joe, you ever think about joining the force? We could use a guy like you.
chandler_bing Who jumps at loud noises!
dr_ross_geller Wow! I could've died tonight.
chandler_bing Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.
dr_ross_geller I do have a newfound respect for life.
chandler_bing Oh my God!
gary So you wanna get some dinner?
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.
gary Oh yeah? Well maybe you and I should take a walk through a bad neighborhood.
phoebe_buffay Okay!
gary All right.
phoebe_buffay Bye!
dr_ross_geller@joey_tribbiani Bye!
joey_tribbiani Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
joey_tribbiani Dude! How come you took off?
chandler_bing Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever
joey_tribbiani Is something wrong?
chandler_bing No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.
joey_tribbiani Okay.
chandler_bing You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
joey_tribbiani That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!
chandler_bing I do not hate Ross!
joey_tribbiani Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
chandler_bing What picture?
joey_tribbiani I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!
chandler_bing Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!
joey_tribbiani Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!
chandler_bing When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.
joey_tribbiani Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.
chandler_bing From a bullet!
joey_tribbiani I know it doesn't make much sense
chandler_bing Much sense?!
joey_tribbiani Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!
chandler_bing So you risked your life, for a sandwich!
joey_tribbiani I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!
chandler_bing So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.
joey_tribbiani No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!
chandler_bing Really?!
joey_tribbiani Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.
chandler_bing Thanks.
joey_tribbiani No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!
joey_tribbiani How good is that?
chandler_bing Oh-oi-ho, yeah!
joey_tribbiani See?
chandler_bing Hm-hmm.
joey_tribbiani Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!
chandler_bing I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.
joey_tribbiani Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!
rachel_green Hey! Hi!
dr_ross_geller Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?
rachel_green Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!
dr_ross_geller Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!
rachel_green Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?
dr_ross_geller The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!
rachel_green What?! What? What happened?!
dr_ross_geller Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?
rachel_green Yeah!
dr_ross_geller And somebody took a shot at me!
rachel_green Really?!
dr_ross_geller No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.
rachel_green Because a car backfired?
dr_ross_geller Okay, why are you here?
rachel_green Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole "seizing" thing but um, Emily called you today.
dr_ross_geller You talked to her?
rachel_green No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.
dr_ross_geller Well, okay, what-what did she say?
rachel_green Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.
dr_ross_geller Wow!
rachel_green Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?
dr_ross_geller Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!
rachel_green Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.
dr_ross_geller Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.
rachel_green Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?
dr_ross_geller Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!
rachel_green Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!
dr_ross_geller You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?
rachel_green Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.
dr_ross_geller Huh.
rachel_green I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?
dr_ross_geller That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.
rachel_green Well, there you go!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.
rachel_green Close call day.
dr_ross_geller Hey, thanks Rach.
rachel_green Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.
dr_ross_geller Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.
rachel_green Oh?
dr_ross_geller "Hey Ross, it's you!" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.
rachel_green No.
dr_ross_geller Hey umm, was-was Monica here?
rachel_green Yeah.
dr_ross_geller Yeah, I want my money back.
rachel_green Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?
dr_ross_geller Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?
phoebe_buffay Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.
dr_ross_geller I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.
monica_geller Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.
chandler_bing Before or after you were shot by your own troops?
dr_ross_geller I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.
chandler_bing Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.
joey_tribbiani Yeah, hero sandwiches.
phoebe_buffay Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.
