phoebe So have you decided on a band for the wedding? Because, y'know, I'm kinda musical.
rachel Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt she's even had time to
phoebe Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?
rachel Yeah, you're on your own.
monica Y'know what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.
joey But I-I-I can't stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. I'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. What?
chandler So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?
joey You guys don't think I look 19?
phoebe Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!
monica Okay everybody, let's go! Let's go!
rachel Okay.
chandler Okay.
joey Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?
phoebe Oh honey no, you ate it all.
joey I was afraid of that.
monica Y'know what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! You're not getting dressed.
chandler Know what I mean?
monica Yeah, but I don't think we have time.
chandler There's gonna be a wedding. You're gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.
monica Let's do it!
monica Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry about it!
chandler I'm not worried, I'm uh, I'm fascinated. Y'know it's like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me.
phoebe Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay.
monica Phoebe!
phoebe If you would've let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.
chandler Sure, you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood. Hey!
rachel Hey!
chandler You look great!
rachel Oh, thanks.
chandler You okay over there?
rachel I don't know, y'know? I feel a little umm... No, y'know what? Nevermind, I'm gonna be fine.

ross Well sure. But I get married all the time so
rachel Ohh
ross You okay?
rachel Yeah, I guess. I-I... I mean, do-do you think we're ever gonna have that?
ross You mean, we-you and me?
rachel Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.
ross Oh good, you scared me for a minute.
rachel Shake it off.
ross I mean-no, it's just 'cause, it's just 'cause you and I were like a nightmare. No, but there was some good times.
rachel No, absolutely. Y'know like it was umm
ross Surely you can think of something good.
rachel Yeah, just give me a minute! Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.
ross What?
rachel Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.
ross Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?
rachel Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.
ross My hands?
rachel Yeah.
ross Yeah?
rachel Uh-huh.
ross Way to go guys. Y'know, you-you were really good at the stuff too.
rachel Oh, I know. Hey, y'know what we never did? Oh no, not that. We uh, we never had bonus night!
ross A what?
rachel Y'know, bonus night. Y'know, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.
ross One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?
rachel Yeah-yeah, we never had that,
ross No.
ross Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, I'm-I'm sure it would be amazing but I...gotta say I really-really don't think it would be a good idea. Y'know? I really, really...don't.
joey 'Sup? 'Sup dude?
chandler Take whatever you want, just please don't hurt me.
joey So you're playing a little Playstation, huh? That's whack! Playstation is whack! 'Sup with the whack Playstation, 'sup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!
chandler Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.
joey Come on man, really how old?!
chandler Young! You're a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!
joey Wow thanks!
chandler Joe?
joey Yeah!
chandler Uhh, you've had a lot of sex right?
joey When? Today? Some, not a lot.
chandler Well, it's just the reason that I'm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable to-I mean I really wanted too, but I couldn't.... There huh-hmm, there-there was an incident.
joey Don't worry about that man, that happens.
chandler It's happened to you?
joey Yeah! Once.
chandler Well, what'd you do?
joey I did it anyway.
monica Phoebe! Come on! Let's go! Come on! Why aren't you dressed yet?!
phoebe I'm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out.
monica No, Phoebe, I'll tell you what, if you get ready now I'll let you play it at the wedding.
phoebe Really?! Oh that's so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again I'll have to pound on you for a little bit.
monica Fair enough, now go get ready!
phoebe Okay.
monica I'll get everybody else , finally we can start celebrating my- I'm sorry, uh apparently I've opened the door to the past.
ross Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just saw
monica Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?
rachel What?
monica See, I've been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people I'm only planning on doing this once. So, uh y'know, maybe this is selfish and I'm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.
rachel Oh honey, but it is just about
ross It is! It is!
monica No it's not! No! No! Now it's about you and Ross getting back together!
rachel What?!
monica See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!
ross Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!
rachel Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!
ross Yeah!
monica That's true.
rachel Honey I swear it we just kissed.
ross It was just a kiss.
phoebe You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?
monica Thunder being stolen!!
rachel Okay come on Phoebe, it's nothing! Monica, come on!
ross Look let's not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesn't even matter!
joey Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!
chandler I don't think that's what they were talking about Joe!!
phoebe What a great night, Chandler can't do it, these guys kissed
joey What?
chandler What?!
joey You guys kissed! Oh my-this is huge!
rachel No!
ross Oh no!
rachel No-no, it's really not huge.
ross And; people thinking it's huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. Which we are not!
monica Well, we're still talking about it, aren't we?
phoebe Well yeah, that and Chandler's problem.
joey Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.
monica Yes that would be lovely.
joey You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!
chandler Yes, you can pass for 19.
joey Really?
chandler Yes!
joey Seriously?
chandler Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!
joey I'm 30!
rachel Joey, you are not! You're 31.
joey Aww crap!
phoebe Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, we'll get us some Mai Thai's, maybe no more for you though.
monica Y'know what? I-I think that umm, I don't feel like going to The Plaza.
phoebe Why?!
rachel Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Look
monica No-no, I-I really don't want to talk about it! I don't! Especially with you.
joey Psss, that is whack!
phoebe Yeah? Okay, I think I'll play it at the wedding.
joey Yeah! Well, I think we'll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you don't."
phoebe Well, I don't think Monica is gonna take this away.
joey Wouldn't she?
phoebe Would she?
joey Would she? You ate my candy bar!
ross Guess who?
rachel Hey.
ross Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the air
rachel What do you think Monica mean when she said she didn't want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.
ross Still thinking about it huh?
rachel Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? Especially you!
ross Oh, who cares?
rachel I care!
ross And so do I.
rachel Y'know what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?
ross Okay. Sure.
rachel Am I going to let you watch me undress?
ross No!
monica I can't believe her, y'know it's just-it's so typical.
chandler Now Monica, I know you're upset, but don't forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then there's going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.
monica Paris?
chandler We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la
monica Keep talking.
chandler Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because it's romantic, but because I can!
monica I love you!
monica Bonjour, monsieur.
chandler Okay, don't say anything, you might scare it away.
chandler It's Paris, who knows we're here!
monica Hi Pheebs, what's up?
phoebe Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, I'm just gonna need a small deposit.
monica What?!
phoebe Y'know, just some good faith money to hold the date.
chandler Pheebs, we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding!
phoebe Oh, I see.
joey They break your heart, don't they?
phoebe Y'know, I don't really their permission.
joey Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!
phoebe Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then you... You gotta do something about your eyes.
joey What?! What's wrong with my eyes.
phoebe They give you away! There's just-there's just too much wisdom in there. Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.
joey And that'll get rid of my wisdom?
phoebe Maybe just 10 minutes for you.
chandler Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I don't care!
monica Yes.
rachel Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didn't want to talk to anyone, especially me?
chandler What a great apology! And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!
rachel No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?
monica Well, let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.
rachel What?!
ross Hey, here's a thought.
rachel Monica, what are you talking about?
monica My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.
chandler Ahh, third base.
monica It's all everybody at the party could talk about!
rachel Monica, y'know what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!
monica We had a characturist!
rachel Oh!!
rachel Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.
monica And yet, here we are doing it again.
rachel Ugh, Monica I don't want to steal your stupid thunder!
monica Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!
ross Got me.
rachel All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ain't gonna happen!
monica I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!
rachel I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!
monica Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!
ross Uh, Rachel, I've been thinking. I don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. I'm calling it off.
chandler Why to save your dignity my man.
rachel Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?
monica I don't know! I don't-maybe you're feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought you'd get married first! Maybe you can't stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!
rachel Oh wow. That-y'know what? That is so unfair. Y'know what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, let's go have sex!
monica I can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night!!
chandler Well, somebody should.
ross Look uh, if we're gonna do this
rachel We're not gonna do this, all right? She's just gonna think that we're doin' it.
ross Oh, I see, so everybody wins.
rachel Who is it?
monica It's Monica, open up!
rachel Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute!
ross Oww!
rachel Yeah, you like that baby? May we help you?
monica I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement I'm going to announce that I'm pregnant!
chandler How is that ever going to happen?!
rachel All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!
monica I know why!
rachel No you don't know why!
monica Okay! Why?!
rachel Because! Because I was sad.
monica What do you mean?
rachel Look, I am so...so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I'm not. I'm not even close. And I don't know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that that's dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!
chandler I don't care, she slept with me.
rachel Anyway sweetie, I am, I'm so sorry I ruined your night.
monica I'm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross.
ross Well, I'm going to take off. Congratulations man.
chandler Thanks.
ross And uh, Rachel.
rachel Yeah.
ross What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.
chandler Hey! Here's a dollar, consider it a deposit. Please sing at our wedding.
phoebe Oh thank you.
chandler Okay.
phoebe Now... "Who will perform the ceremony! Who will perform the cer--Oh-oh! All right, I'll pound on him in the morning.
