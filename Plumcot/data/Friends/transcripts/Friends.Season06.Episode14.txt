joey_tribbiani Oh, uh, hey Rach. I uh, I was just coming over here to uh... Oh wait, I don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore. Uh, I'm eating their food. What are you doing?
rachel_green Ross is on a date with my sister and they shut the drapes two and a-half-hours ago.
joey_tribbiani Whoa, I didn't know we could date your sister!
monica_geller Joey we know you steal our food.
chandler_bing I'm good.
monica_geller Oh, are the drapes still closed hon?
rachel_green Yeah. And y'know who should've shut their drapes? Is that perverted old couple two doors over.
chandler_bing Is that a swing?
rachel_green Oh don't even ask!
chandler_bing Yuck!
joey_tribbiani I can't believe Ross went out with Rachel's sister! When Chandler made out with my sister I was mad at him for 10 years.
chandler_bing That was like 5 years ago.
joey_tribbiani Yeah you got 5 years left!
chandler_bing Joey
joey_tribbiani You wanna make it 6?!
rachel_green Oh Ross, hi! Hey, how are ya? There you are!

rachel_green I'll take a coffee. So how was your big date last night?
dr_ross_geller Uhh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.
rachel_green Yeah fun? Great! So uh, so did you guys hit it off?
dr_ross_geller I guess so.
rachel_green So uh, so did anything happen? Because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes!
dr_ross_geller No. No. Nothing happened. I shut the drapes to uh, show her slides of my favorite fossils.
rachel_green Oh, slides. So really nothing happened.
dr_ross_geller Something could've happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.
rachel_green Right. Was it the, "Please don't show me another picture of a trilobite vibe?"
dr_ross_geller Anyway, if she, if she wasn't in to me, why-why would she ask me out again?
rachel_green She asked-asked you out again?
dr_ross_geller Yeah-uh-huh. Tomorrow night, Valentine's Day, the most romantic day of the year. Who knows what could happen? I might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what I mean.
rachel_green Okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay-okay! I got it! I got it! I got it! I can't! I can't! I can't! I cannot go with you and my sister thing. Okay? I just can't. It's just too weird, all right? I imagine the two of you together and I freak out. It freaks me out. I can't do it! I can't do it.
dr_ross_geller Okay! Okay! Okay! It's okay. It's okay. Hey, it's too weird for you, I won't see her again.
rachel_green Thank you. I...yeah.
dr_ross_geller I mean after tomorrow night.
rachel_green No-no-no! No-no-no! Please Ross, I can't! I can't do it! It's just gonna freak me out!!!
dr_ross_geller Okay! Okay! Ooh-hey-hey-hey! Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll-I'll tell her tonight I can't see her anymore.
rachel_green Ross thanks.
dr_ross_geller You want me to call her right now?
rachel_green Oh no! No! No-no-no-no! No, I mean come on that's-that's crazy-I mean that's crazy. So what's-what's going on with you? What is going on with you?
dr_ross_geller Well umm, oh! I might be teaching another class this semester!
rachel_green Yeah do it now, call right now.
monica_geller This is my favorite part.
phoebe_buffay Yeah me too.
phoebe_buffay Oh y'know what's sadder than this? Bambi. I cried for three days with that movie. No wait two! Because on the third day my mother killed herself so I was partly crying for that.
chandler_bing Well see now that I can see crying over, but Bambi is a cartoon!
joey_tribbiani You didn't cry when Bambi's mother died?
chandler_bing Yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer!
monica_geller Chandler there's nothing wrong with crying! I mean you don't have to be so macho all the time.
chandler_bing I'm not macho.
monica_geller Yeah you're right. I don't know what I was thinking.
chandler_bing No, I guess I just never really cried. Y'know? I'm not a crying kind of guy.
joey_tribbiani Come on man there's gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?
chandler_bing I'd be sad sure, but I wouldn't cry.
joey_tribbiani Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."
chandler_bing Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, I'm rich!
monica_geller Oh, I've got it! I have got it! Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!
phoebe_buffay All right, what's going on there?
chandler_bing Oh, that's Parent's Day, first grade. That's me with the janitor Martin.
monica_geller Where were your parents?
chandler_bing Oh they didn't want to come!
phoebe_buffay Oh Chandler!
monica_geller Poor thing!
phoebe_buffay So that story doesn't make you cry?
chandler_bing No! Look, I don't cry! It's not a big deal! Okay?!
joey_tribbiani No! It's not okay! It's not okay at all!! You're dead inside!!
the_fan Excuse me.
phoebe_buffay Yeah?
the_fan Are you Phoebe Buffay?
phoebe_buffay Yeah.

phoebe_buffay Oh you're my biggest fan? I've always wanted to meet you! Hi! Sure! Yeah!
the_fan Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think you're really talented.
phoebe_buffay You're just saying that because you're my biggest fan. Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? He's a fan. Bye!
joey_tribbiani So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?

joey_tribbiani Oh, you're Phoebe's fan!
the_fan Oh yeah! I've seen all her movies.
joey_tribbiani Movies?
the_fan That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.
joey_tribbiani I don't think so.
the_fan No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store aren't gonna believe this!
joey_tribbiani Hey Gunther, don't let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebe's a porn star!
gunther Well, I wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.
jill_green Hey!
rachel_green Hey!
jill_green You'll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didn't even tell me why!
rachel_green Ohhh well. Y'know what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! He's a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.
jill_green Y'know, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but I'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.
rachel_green It's not random, it's Bob.
jill_green It's probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress-No that can't be it. It's really gotta be the smart thing. Oh I'm so stupid! I'm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!
rachel_green No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.
jill_green You asked him too?!
rachel_green Hm-mmm.
jill_green Why?!
rachel_green Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge history
jill_green I don't understand, do you want to go out with Ross?
rachel_green No.
jill_green You don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?
rachel_green Y'know Bob in Human Resources
jill_green Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! You had me doubting my fashion sense!
rachel_green Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just don't date Ross! There's a million other guys out there, you just
jill_green Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.
rachel_green I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!
jill_green Why are you so jealous of me?
rachel_green Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you can't have!
jill_green Can't have?! Excuse me, the only thing I can't have is dairy!
rachel_green All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!
jill_green Who?!
rachel_green In Human Resources!!!!!!
rachel_green ...I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!
monica_geller You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
rachel_green Do I have my own castle?
dr_ross_geller Hey! Uh, Phoebe's not here is she?
rachel_green No.
monica_geller Oh great! Did you get a movie?
joey_tribbiani Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.
chandler_bing You didn't get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?
joey_tribbiani Sort of
monica_geller Guys, what's going on?
joey_tribbiani Phoebe's a porn star!
all@ What?!!
chandler_bing Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.
rachel_green Oh my God!
monica_geller That's Phoebe! Where did you get that?
joey_tribbiani Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.
dr_ross_geller And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didn't know he was in there.
rachel_green Wow! I mean, I just-I can't, I can't believe this. Y'know, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe who's always been somewhat of a question mark.
monica_geller This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, y'know she had such a terrible childhood.
chandler_bing Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I don't do porn.
monica_geller Yes, but you are dead inside.
joey_tribbiani All right well, I'd better take that back.
monica_geller Wh-what, why?
joey_tribbiani We can't watch that! I mean that's Phoebe!
monica_geller Yeah you're right, we can't-we shouldn't watch this.
rachel_green Absolutely not.
monica_geller Y'know maybe a little bit!
rachel_green Probably just the first half.
joey_tribbiani No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebe's our friend! Well, I'm not gonna watch it!
dr_ross_geller Yeah! Good for you Joe!
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
buffay_the_vampire_layer#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode14 Ah, I thought I'd find you here, Nasforatool.
the_vampire#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode14 Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?
buffay_the_vampire_layer#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode14 Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.
monica_geller Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?
chandler_bing Her ankle is what you're watching?
rachel_green Well it's hard to tell... Oh God, if she would just stop moving.
chandler_bing She's just doing her job!
joey_tribbiani You sick bastards!
rachel_green Oh, it's a tattoo! That's weird, Phoebe doesn't... Wait that's Ursula! That's not Phoebe that is Ursula!
joey_tribbiani Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!
phoebe_buffay Hey! What's up? Oh my God! What am I doing?!!
monica_geller Hey sweetie!
chandler_bing Hey!
monica_geller Chicken Soup for the Soul?
chandler_bing There's no back to this couch!
monica_geller Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.
chandler_bing Yeah I know, but I figured a shot y'know? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn't think I was y'know, all dead inside.
monica_geller Oh that's so sweet! Look Chandler I don't care if you can't cry, I love you.
chandler_bing Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.
monica_geller Stop it!
chandler_bing No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, we're up at the altar and I'm like this.
monica_geller I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.
chandler_bing Yeah?
monica_geller Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.
chandler_bing Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.
monica_geller And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And you're writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still can't shed one tiny tear, I know you'll be crying a river inside.
chandler_bing Aww, I love you so
monica_geller What is wrong with you?!!!
chandler_bing What?!
monica_geller What?! You can't shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!
chandler_bing So you didn't mean any of that?!
monica_geller No you robot!!
dr_ross_geller You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear to... Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-that's just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, they've really taken a liking to me. Uhh what's-what's-what's the matter?
jill_green Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know we're not supposed to see each other anymore and I'm okay with that, it's just that I don't know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.
dr_ross_geller Of course, what happened?
jill_green I don't want to talk about it.
dr_ross_geller Okay, umm
jill_green But you know what might really cheer me up?
dr_ross_geller What?
jill_green Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.
dr_ross_geller Wow! Really?!
jill_green Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.
dr_ross_geller Well, I'd love to! Here, you wait right here and I'll go get the projector and my notes!
jill_green Oh great! Thanks Ross, you're such a good friend!
dr_ross_geller Ohh!
rachel_green Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I can't find her anywhere.
monica_geller No, I haven't.
rachel_green Well, is Ross home? Maybe I'll just call him to see if he's actually seen her.
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode14 Who is it?
phoebe_buffay It's Phoebe! Phoebe!
ursula#unknown#Friends.Season06.Episode14 Hey!

phoebe_buffay No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! And shame on all of you! You're disgusting! Especially you with that!
dr_ross_geller Slides are almost ready.
jill_green Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!
dr_ross_geller Uh okay, well there's-there's wine in the kitchen.
jill_green Oh great!
dr_ross_geller Hello?
rachel_green What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!
dr_ross_geller O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-she's really upset we're just talking.
rachel_green Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!
dr_ross_geller So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!
rachel_green Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!
dr_ross_geller Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.
jill_green So?
phoebe_buffay Hey!
joey_tribbiani Hey!
phoebe_buffay So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.
joey_tribbiani Oh no, not you too!
phoebe_buffay No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks; there were a lot of them.
joey_tribbiani Nice!
phoebe_buffay Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.
joey_tribbiani That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?
phoebe_buffay Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.
joey_tribbiani You do?
phoebe_buffay Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?
joey_tribbiani Yeah.
chandler_bing Hey.
dr_ross_geller You uh, you may have been right about Jill.
rachel_green Oh! I knew it! What happened?
dr_ross_geller Umm, she kissed me.
rachel_green What?! You kissed!
chandler_bing Maybe we should give them some privacy.
monica_geller Shhhh!!!
dr_ross_geller Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?
rachel_green Well, it doesn't sound like it! I mean, it's pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just don't kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!
dr_ross_geller Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didn't stop it. I guess I-I just wasn't thinking
rachel_green Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!
dr_ross_geller Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.
rachel_green Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.
dr_ross_geller Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!
rachel_green What?!
dr_ross_geller No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.
rachel_green Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.
dr_ross_geller You're welcome.
monica_geller Oh my God! Are-are you crying?
chandler_bing I just don't see why those two can't work things out!
jill_green All right, I'm leaving! Because I'm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. That's you Rachel!
rachel_green Yeah, I got that.
jill_green And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?
dr_ross_geller You take care Jill.
jill_green Okay, see ya!
rachel_green Bye-bye-e!
monica_geller Bye.
chandler_bing I-I can't believe Jill's gone. I can't help it, I opened a gate.
