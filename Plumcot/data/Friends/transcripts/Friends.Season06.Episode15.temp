rachel Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
monica Oh my God!
phoebe Wow!
joey What is the matter with you?!
phoebe No! Barry and Mindy.
joey Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
rachel Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
joey Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
rachel Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
monica Why did they get divorced?
rachel Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
ross I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
phoebe Which time?
ross The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
joey I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
ross I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
chandler Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
monica And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
chandler Sure I would!
all Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
chandler What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
ross No, I just think Monica was that fat.
joey Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
chandler What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
phoebe What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
ross What?!
rachel Merrill Lynch?
phoebe Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
rachel Well why didn't you take the job?
phoebe Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
ross Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
ross Oh my God! Rachel Green?
rachel Rob Tillman!
ross No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
rachel Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
ross No, no-no, Ross Geller.
rachel Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
ross Yeah. Right.
rachel Wow! How are you?!
ross Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
rachel Ohh! Me too!
ross Is-isn't it the best?
rachel Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
ross Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
rachel Ohh, I would love too.
ross Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
rachel Ohh! Okay!
ross Come on!
rachel Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
ross No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't
rachel Oh yeah? Okay.
ross Okay.
rachel But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
ross Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
joey So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
monica He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
monicas_boyfriend Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
monica Thanks.
monicas_boyfriend Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
joey Wow!!
monicas_boyfriend Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
joey Oh dear God, let me think.
chandler Hey.
joey Hey.
monica Oh no! What's the matter?
chandler Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
monicas_boyfriend Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
monica Okay.
monicas_boyfriend Okay.
monica Bye.
monicas_boyfriend Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
chandler Was his question what's more boring than him?
joey Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
chandler Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
joey Really?
chandler Ehh.
monica Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
joey That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
monica No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
joey That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
chandler I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
joey Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
chandler Okay!
joey All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
chandler All right!
phoebe Hey!
monica Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
phoebe What?
monica Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
phoebe Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
ross Hey Mon!
monica Hey!
ross Mon, look who I ran into!
monica Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
rachel Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
monica You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!

chandler Hey.
rachel Oh yeah.
ross And that's Phoebe over there!
phoebe Hi!
monica Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we've seen each other?
ross 1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon's party. I played you one of my songs, y'know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual.

ross Sometimes, you should come over sometime! I'll play you one of my other
rachel Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
monica Rach, he's a friend of ours.
rachel You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
chandler Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
ross Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
rachel He's coming over! He's coming over!
monica Joey!
joey I know, here-here!!
monica Ohhh! No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.

joey All right, here's a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I'm delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!
chandler Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
monica You realize what you are don't you?
chandler What?
monica You're his bitch.
phoebe No-no!! No!!
monica Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
phoebe No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
chandler But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
phoebe What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.

monica Yes!!
phoebe Then yes that is what I'm having.
monica Oh my God!
ross Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
phoebe Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
monica Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
chandler I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
monica Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
phoebe So what's going on with you?
ross Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
phoebe Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
ross Yeah.
phoebe How long has it been since you had sex?
ross Well, last weekend
phoebe Oh that's not so bad.
ross ...will be two months
phoebe That is.
ross ...since I stopped trying.
phoebe Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
ross What-what do you mean?
phoebe I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other
ross Oh.
phoebe Y'know, dirty talk, mánage á trois, toys
ross Wow!
phoebe Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
ross Okay, I think I got it.
phoebe Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
monica Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
chandler Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
joey Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
monica Yeah! She's right in there!
joey Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!
joey All right, and over there is Brady's Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning.

rachel Hey!
joey All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
rachel Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
joey Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
rachel Isn't that a line from the show?!
joey Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
rachel That's a line from the show too!
joey Okay, you watch too much TV.
chandler Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
joey Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
chandler Yeah?
joey I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
chandler I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
joey Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
rachel Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
joey Iced tea.
chandler Okay, anything for you sir?
joey Did I not just tell him?
rachel Yes, you did.
joey Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
chandler It's not all juice!
ross So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
carol Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.

ben Yay!
ross Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
carol Like what?
ross Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.

chandler Aww, thanks man.
monica Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
joey Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
chandler Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
joey Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
chandler Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
joey Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
rachel Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
monica Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
rachel Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
monica Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
rachel Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
monica Well, you're not.
rachel Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!
monica Yeah I can! And don't think I don't, because I do! I mean all the time, you betcha!

monica Of course I have! What do you think, I'm some 30 year old virgin?
rachel Oh my God! You're a 30 year old virgin!
monica Say it louder, I don't think the guy all the way in the back heard you!
guy_all_the_way_in_the_back Yeah, I heard it.
monica It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
rachel Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
monica Y'know what? You are right?!
rachel Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever

rachel Oh what do you know? Virgin!
