monica Do you realize that four weeks from today we're getting married? Four weeks baby!! Four weeks!!!
chandler Do you realize you get louder each week?
monica There's still so much to do. Have you written your vows yet?
chandler I figured I'd buy those. Pat, I'd like to buy a vow.
monica Sweetie, you know I have no sense of humor when it comes to the wedding.
chandler Right. So uh, have you written yours yet?
monica No! But I know exactly what I'm going to say.
chandler Do you happen to know what I'm going to say?
monica Let's just do it right now. Okay? It won't be hard. Just say what's in your heart.
chandler Look at her go! She must love me more than I love her! What's wrong with me? Ooh, don't open that door.
chandler Monica, there are no words... There are no words! This should not be this hard!
joey All right, uh... Oh hey, you've done this before Ross, well what did you say when you made up your vows?
ross Well with Carol, I promised never to love another woman until the day I die. She made no such promise.
chandler I'm so pathetic! Monica knows what she wants to say! You should've seen her. Writing, writing, writing!
rachel Monica what?
phoebe What?!
rachel What is the emergency?!
monica You have to help me! I'm supposed to be writing my vows and all I have is this!
rachel Well, I like the pretty little drawing of you in the wedding dress.
monica Thank you.
phoebe Yeah, except your breasts look kinda small.
monica Those are my eyes! Those are my breasts.
phoebe Oh! Yeah!
ross Well, why don't you just start with something simple. Like umm, Monica from the moment I met you, I knew I loved you.
chandler Yeah, I'm not sure I can do that.
ross ..everyone, this is Chandler!
fat_monica Hi, I'm Ross's little sister.
chandler Okay.
rachel Okay. Okay. Okay. Umm, maybe you can start with, "Chandler, even though we were friends; there was a part of me that always knew I wanted more."
chandler All right, there's a nuclear holocaust, I'm the last man on Earth. Would you go out with me?
monica Ennnh.
monica Ooh, are we allowed to lie in the vows?!
phoebe Well maybe you don't talk about your feelings back then. Maybe you just say something about y'know all the things that he's taught you. Like... Or all the things you taught him.
monica Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. You got one, two three, four , five, six, and seven!
chandler There are seven?! That's one?
monica It's kind of an important one!
chandler Oh, y'know-y'know what, I was looking at it upside down.
rachel Well, y'know, sometimes that helps.
monica All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7..7.....7...7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7...!
joey Oh, I got it! How about saying something like, "Monica
chandler Monica
joey "...when I look back over our time together..."
chandler Yeah?
joey Well, I can't do everything! Look back over your time together.
phoebe Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute.
monica No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
chandler You'll get one.
monica Oh yeah? When?
chandler All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?
monica Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically.
monica Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?
chandler No, no, no.
monica What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
chandler Uh, uh.
monica Well?
chandler Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack!
ross I'm getting married today!! Ahh, whoo-hoo!!
monica Do you think he knew I was here?
chandler Nice try.
monica Wait, wait, wait!
chandler Look, Monica
monica Look!
chandler This is not going to work.
monica I bet this will work!
chandler You are so great! I love you!
monica What?
chandler Nothing! I said, I said "You're so great" and then I just, I just stopped talking!
monica You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
chandler No I didn't!
monica Yes, you did!
chandler No I didn't!
monica You love me!
chandler No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
chandler Y'know I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?
monica Then all your stuff would be here.
chandler Well, what if all my stuff was here?
monica Then you'd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesn't make any sense.
chandler Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what I'm saying?
monica You wanted it to be a surprise.
chandler Oh my God.
monica Chandler... In all my life... I never thought I would be so lucky. As to...fall in love with my best...my best... There's a reason why girls don't do this!
chandler Okay! Okay! Okay! I'll do it! Oh God, I thought... Wait a minute, I-I can do this. I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. And if you'll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. Monica, will you marry me?
monica Yes.
joey Can we come it yet?! We're dying out here!
monica Come in! Come in! We're engaged!!!
joey Hey!
ross Hey!
rachel Hey!
phoebe Hey!
rachel Hey, what have you guys been up to?
ross Oh, we were helping Chandler write his vows, but he kicked us out because Joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.
joey How is "Monica, I love your sweet ass," inappropriate?
ross How's Monica coming along with her vows?
phoebe Well let's just say its she's lucky she has a sweet ass, 'cause she's not so good at the writing.
ross I can't believe in four weeks they're gonna be married!
phoebe Well let's just hope it works. Y'know nine out of ten marriages end in divorce?
ross Phoebe that's not true.
phoebe Yeah, you're right. How's the Mrs.?
rachel I can't believe they've been together for three years.
joey Has it been that long?!
ross Believe me, it seems like less because they hid it from us for so long.
joey Hey, it's me! I'm comin' in!
chandler I've had a very long, hard day.
joey Ahh, I'm gonna go get some chicken. Want some?
chandler Ahh, no thanks. No chicken, bye-bye then.
joey Okay.
chandler Are you okay? I'm so sorry, he wouldn't leave. He kept asking me about chicken.
monica Chicken? I could eat some chicken.
chandler Hey Joe!
chandler Yeah, can I get a 3-piece, some cole slaw, some beans, and a Coke--Diet Coke.
rachel I don't know why they didn't just tell us.
joey I know! I mean it's not like we weren't cool about it.
joey You?! And-and you?!
monica Yes, but you cannot tell anyone! No one knows!
joey How?! When?!
chandler It happened in London.
joey IN LONDON!!!
chandler The reason we didn't tell anyone was because we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.
joey But it is a big deal!! I have to tell someone!
chandler No-no-no-no-no! You can't!
monica Please? Please?! We just don't want to deal with telling everyone, okay? Just promise you won't tell.
joey All right! Man, this is unbelievable!
monica I can't wait to be with you! I'll just tell Rachel I'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple of hours.
chandler Laundry. Huh. Is that my new nickname?
monica Awww, y'know what your nickname is, Mr. Big
rachel Arghh!!
phoebe Oh, look! There's Monica and Chandler! Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey! Ohh!! Ohh! Ahh-ahhh!!
rachel What?!
phoebe Ahhh!! Chandler and Monica!! Chandler and Monica!!
rachel Oh my God!
phoebe CHANDLER AND MONICA!!!!
rachel OH MY GOD!!!
phoebe OH!! MY EYES!!! MY EYES!!!!
rachel Phoebe!! Phoebe!! It's okay!! It's okay!!
phoebe NO! THEY'RE DOING IT!!!
rachel I KNOW!! I KNOW!! I KNOW!
phoebe YOU KNOW?!!!
rachel Yes, I know! And Joey knows! But Ross doesn't know so you have to stop screaming!!
ross What's going on?
phoebe_and_rachel Ohhh!!!
rachel HI!! Hi!
ross What?! What?!
rachel Nothing! Oh God, we're just so excited that you want to get this apartment!
ross Actually, it looks really good.
phoebe Get in here!!!
phoebe Okay, so now they know that you know and they don't know that Rachel knows?
joey Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!
phoebe Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own
rachel All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.
monica Bye!
all Bye!
phoebe Bye Chandler! I miss you already.
chandler Okay, did you see that?! With the inappropriate and the pinching!!
monica Actually, I did!
chandler Okay, so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?
monica Ohhh, oh my God! Oh my God! She knows about us!
chandler Phoebe knows about us!
joey Well I didn't tell them!
monica Them?! Who's them?
joey Uhhh, Phoebe and Joey.
monica Joey!
joey And Rachel. I would've told you but they made me promise not to tell!
monica Oh man, they think they are so slick messing with us! But see they don't know that we know that they know! So
chandler Ahh yes, the messers become the messies!
phoebe I'll have to get back to you on that. Okay, bye! Oh my God! He wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more!
rachel Are you kidding?!
phoebe No!
rachel I can not believe he would do that to Mon-Whoa! Joey, do they know that we know?
joey No.
rachel Joey!
joey They know you know.
rachel Ugh, I knew it! Oh I cannot believe those two!
phoebe God, they thought they can mess with us! They're trying to mess with us?! They don't know that we know they know we know! Joey, you can't say anything!
joey I couldn't even if I wanted too.
chandler Listen, this is totally getting out of hand! Okay? She wants me to put lotion on her!
monica She's bluffing!
chandler Look, she's not backing down! She went like this!
phoebe He's not backing down. He went to get lotion.
joey Oh man! Aren't you guys done yet?!
rachel Joey look, just look at it this way, the sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler the sooner this is all over and out in the open.
joey Ooh!
rachel Okay!
joey I like that! Oh, okay! Show him your bra! He's afraid of bras! Can't work 'em!
phoebe Joey! Wow, you didn't rip off any buttons.
joey It's not my first time.
monica You go back out there and you seduce her till she cracks!
chandler Okay, give me a second! Did you clean up in here?
monica Of course.
chandler Oh, you're-you're going?
phoebe Umm, not without you, lover. So, this is my bra.
chandler It's very, very nice. Well, come here. I'm very happy were gonna have all the sex.
phoebe You should be. I'm very bendy. I'm gonna kiss you now.
chandler Not if I kiss you first.
phoebe Ooh.
chandler Well, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but-but kiss.
phoebe Here it comes. Our first kiss.
chandler Okay! Okay! Okay! You win! You win!! I can't have sex with ya!
phoebe And why not?!
chandler Because I'm in love with Monica!!
phoebe You're-you're what?!
chandler Love her! That's right, I...LOVE...HER!!! I love her!! I love you, Monica.
monica I love you too Chandler.
phoebe I just-I thought you guys were doing it, I didn't know you were in love!
joey So that's it! It's over! Everybody knows!
monica Well actually, Ross doesn't.
chandler Yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.
ross No! No! Wh... What are you doing?!! GET OFF MY SISTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
phoebe Y'know, you're friend's getting married, it's gotta change things.
rachel You really think it would be that different?
phoebe How could it not be? I mean pretty soon they're gonna be having kids, and then they're just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids. And then maybe they're gonna have to leave the city to be near a Volvo dealership.
rachel Well, things change.
joey I don't want them to move to a Volvo dealership!
ross It'll be okay Joe.
joey I'm sorry, I just...I like things the way they are.
rachel Hey, who's this little naked guy?
ross That little naked guy would be me.
rachel Aww, look at the little thing.
ross Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
chandler Who are those people?
ross Got me.
monica Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
rachel Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
monica Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
ross Looks like a fun gang.
joey Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
ross Nono, that would be me again.
monica Hey, you guys!
phoebe Hey.
joey Hey.
chandler What's going on?
rachel Well, we were just talkin' about you guys gettin' married and how great it is.
joey Yeah, you can get a Volvo. If that's what you really want.
monica Oh that's so sweet.
chandler So we both finished our vows.
phoebe Oh!
joey Hey!
rachel Oh, can we read them?
monica Yeah, I don't hear Chandler's and he doesn't hear mine.
rachel Okay.
phoebe Okay.
phoebe Oh, that's beautiful.
joey Funny one! That's good!
rachel Monica, will-will you marry me?
joey What? I don't get it.
ross Oh man, this is hilarious.
monica Chandler!!
chandler Don't worry honey, we'll make yours funnier.
chandler Okay, what do you guys think?
ross Dude!
joey I have never known love like this.
chandler You really like it?
ross Dude! How-how did you write this?
chandler I stole Monica's and changed the name.
ross You can't do that!
joey If he goes first he can!
