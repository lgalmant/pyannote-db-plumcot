ross I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
chandler_and_joey That's nice.
ross No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
joey Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
ross Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
chandler What are you crazy? That's a baby!
joey He should take the sack?
ross Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
chandler Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
joey Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
joey Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
chandler Well, only if you order stuff.
joey I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
ross Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
joey When's that?
ross Tonight.
joey Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
ross You take your time.
chandler There it is! So what're you gonna do?
joey What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
chandler And your friend Phoebe?
joey Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
chandler Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
dr_mitchell .you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.
dr_mitchell Okay, errrr, Monica?
monica Yes?yes, she is.
rachel Hi, this is my friend Rachel.

rachel Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
dr_rosen Excuse me?
rachel I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
monica Thank you.
rachel Right.
rachel .so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
monica Uh, you left out the stupid part.
rachel Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said "yes."
monica I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
rachel What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
chandler Alright, what have we learned so far?
the_whole_party SURPRISE!!!

phoebe oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey?
chandler Did you see Betty?
mr_geller I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say "get out of my office!"
ross Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
mr_geller I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash;
ross Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, "Oh my god I'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?
mr_geller No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
ross No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
mr_geller 'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
ross Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
mr_geller Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew.
mr_geller So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?
ross No, we can go to Williamsburg.
mr_geller Eat your fish.
monica Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
rachel Okay, coming!
monica Hi, come on in.
dr_mitchell Hey.
monica Hi, Geoffrey.
rachel Hi.
dr_rosen Ah here, we brought wine.
dr_mitchell Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?
rachel Oh, that's great. Look at that.
dr_rosen So, Monica, how's the ankle?
monica It's uh...
monica .well, why don't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle.
rachel You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why don't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT!
rachel Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
monica It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
rachel Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
monica A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
dr_mitchell So?
dr_rosen So... they sss-still seem normal.
dr_mitchell That's because they are.
dr_rosen okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into...
dr_mitchell Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this.
monica I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
rachel I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
monica Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
rachel You know what?
monica What?
rachel You know what?
monica What!?
rachel You know what?
monica What!!?
rachel Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
rachel Hello! Here we go!
dr_rosen This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
rachel Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
monica Yeah...see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
dr_mitchell Really?
monica Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?
dr_rosen So, Monica, what do you do?
rachel Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
dr_rosen Good for you.
rachel Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
dr_rosen This hummus is great.
dr_mitchell God bless the chickpea.
monica Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
rachel And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
