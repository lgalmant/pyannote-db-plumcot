rachel_green Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!
monica_geller Oh my God!
phoebe_buffay Wow!
joey_tribbiani What is the matter with you?!
phoebe_buffay No! Barry and Mindy.
joey_tribbiani Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?
rachel_green Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.
joey_tribbiani Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?
rachel_green Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.
monica_geller Why did they get divorced?
rachel_green Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?
dr_ross_geller I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.
phoebe_buffay Which time?
dr_ross_geller The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.
joey_tribbiani I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.
dr_ross_geller I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.
chandler_bing Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.
monica_geller And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.
chandler_bing Sure I would!
all@ Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!
chandler_bing What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?
dr_ross_geller No, I just think Monica was that fat.
joey_tribbiani Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!
chandler_bing What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.
phoebe_buffay What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?
dr_ross_geller What?!
rachel_green Merrill Lynch?
phoebe_buffay Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.
rachel_green Well why didn't you take the job?
phoebe_buffay Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.
dr_ross_geller Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?
dr_ross_geller Oh my God! Rachel Green?
rachel_green Rob Tillman!
dr_ross_geller No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!
rachel_green Oh, I'm sorry. Ross Tillman.
dr_ross_geller No, no-no, Ross Geller.
rachel_green Ohh, of course Monica's brother!
dr_ross_geller Yeah. Right.
rachel_green Wow! How are you?!
dr_ross_geller Good-good, I'm-I'm married.
rachel_green Ohh! Me too!
dr_ross_geller Is-isn't it the best?
rachel_green Oh, it's the best! So, umm how's Monica?
dr_ross_geller Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she's right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi.
rachel_green Ohh, I would love too.
dr_ross_geller Yeah? Oh-oh, she'd be so excited!
rachel_green Ohh! Okay!
dr_ross_geller Come on!
rachel_green Oh wait, don't you have to pay for your, Busty Ladies?
dr_ross_geller No, it's okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don't
rachel_green Oh yeah? Okay.
dr_ross_geller Okay.
rachel_green But! Don't you have to give him his money back?
dr_ross_geller Uh-huh. Hey, here you go buddy. Sorry, no porn for you. Okay, let's go see Monica!
joey_tribbiani So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh?
monica_geller He's not boring! He's just-he's just low key.
dr_roger Here we go, one Hazelnut Latte.
monica_geller Thanks.
dr_roger Yeah. Y'know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it's a seed.
joey_tribbiani Wow!!
dr_roger Can anyone else name a well known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?
joey_tribbiani Oh dear God, let me think.
chandler_bing Hey.
joey_tribbiani Hey.
monica_geller Oh no! What's the matter?
chandler_bing Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."
dr_roger Y'know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital.
monica_geller Okay.
dr_roger Okay.
monica_geller Bye.
dr_roger Bye-bye. Oh uh, by the way, the answer is, the Brazil nut.
chandler_bing Was his question what's more boring than him?
joey_tribbiani Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?
chandler_bing Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.
joey_tribbiani Really?
chandler_bing Ehh.
monica_geller Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?
joey_tribbiani That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?
monica_geller No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!
joey_tribbiani That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!
chandler_bing I could use the money; it could give me time to write.
joey_tribbiani Oh right great! Welcome aboard!
chandler_bing Okay!
joey_tribbiani All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!
chandler_bing All right!
phoebe_buffay Hey!
monica_geller Hey Phoebe! Guess what?
phoebe_buffay What?
monica_geller Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant!
phoebe_buffay Ohh that's so sweet! Oh! Hang on! Hang onnnnnn!!! Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it's a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it's okay. It's okay, you're allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.
dr_ross_geller Hey Mon!
monica_geller Hey!
dr_ross_geller Mon, look who I ran into!
monica_geller Oh my God! Rachel!! You look terrific!
rachel_green Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?
monica_geller You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds!

rachel_green Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!
monica_geller Rach, he's a friend of ours.
rachel_green You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?
chandler_bing Well it's kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he's not real.
dr_ross_geller Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!
rachel_green He's coming over! He's coming over!
monica_geller Joey!

joey_tribbiani Well, it's always nice to meet the fans.
rachel_green Ah!
joey_tribbiani She's not crazy is she?
monica_geller No.
joey_tribbiani So uh, how you doin'?
phoebe_buffay Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Go!! Who's this? Oh okay, you're gonna like working for me. What's your name? What kind of name is Brendy? I... Whatever... Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.

chandler_bing Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.
monica_geller You realize what you are don't you?
chandler_bing What?
monica_geller You're his bitch.
phoebe_buffay No-no!! No!!
monica_geller Oh wait! You didn't just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!!
phoebe_buffay No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars.
chandler_bing But the Kit-Kats are all right?!
phoebe_buffay What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can't call my office they'll kill me! I can't call my clients they'll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts.
monica_geller What?!
phoebe_buffay My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can't breathe.
chandler_bing Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?!
phoebe_buffay Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm?
monica_geller Yes!!
phoebe_buffay Then yes that is what I'm having.
monica_geller Oh my God!
dr_ross_geller Come on Pheebs, it's not that bad! Y'know most people would be excited if they didn't have to work for a couple of weeks.
phoebe_buffay Most people don't like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I'm already going crazy. I miss Joan.
monica_geller Honey, having a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow it down.
chandler_bing I always thought having a heart attack was nature's way of telling you to die! But you're not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.
monica_geller Let's take a walk. Y'know maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine!
phoebe_buffay So what's going on with you?
dr_ross_geller Well umm, I've been doing a lot more of my kara-tay.
phoebe_buffay Still going through that dry spell with Carol?
dr_ross_geller Yeah.
phoebe_buffay How long has it been since you had sex?
dr_ross_geller Well, last weekend
phoebe_buffay Oh that's not so bad.
dr_ross_geller ...will be two months
phoebe_buffay That is.
dr_ross_geller ...since I stopped trying.
phoebe_buffay Maybe you need to spice things up a little.
dr_ross_geller What-what do you mean?
phoebe_buffay I don't know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other
dr_ross_geller Oh.
phoebe_buffay Y'know, dirty talk, mánage á trois, toys
dr_ross_geller Wow!
phoebe_buffay Roll playing... You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!
dr_ross_geller Okay, I think I got it.
phoebe_buffay Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you're-you're-you're rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody's watching! It never happened.
monica_geller Sorry. So how's it going with Joey?
chandler_bing Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, "Bring me food." Two is, "I'm with a girl, bring us food." Three is, "I'm lost and I can't find food."
joey_tribbiani Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right?
monica_geller Yeah! She's right in there!
joey_tribbiani Oh great. Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready!

rachel_green Hey!
joey_tribbiani All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?
rachel_green Wow! Umm, y'know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn't.
joey_tribbiani Why? Why can't the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?
rachel_green Isn't that a line from the show?!
joey_tribbiani Uh, yeah but uh, I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.
rachel_green That's a line from the show too!
joey_tribbiani Okay, you watch too much TV.
chandler_bing Here you go Joe, here's the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for.
joey_tribbiani Thanks! Yeah, there's pulp in that.
chandler_bing Yeah?
joey_tribbiani I thought we talked about this. I don't like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn't juice. All juice, okay?
chandler_bing I'm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.
joey_tribbiani Oh my God, I'm sorry, I'm being so rude. Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.
rachel_green Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.
joey_tribbiani Iced tea.
chandler_bing Okay, anything for you sir?
joey_tribbiani Did I not just tell him?
rachel_green Yes, you did.
joey_tribbiani Okay look, Chandler, if this you have got to listen! You're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't ya?
chandler_bing It's not all juice!
dr_ross_geller So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there.
carol_willick Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.
dr_ross_geller Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.
carol_willick What do you mean?
dr_ross_geller Carol our sex life is-it's just not working
ben_geller Dad!!

ben_geller Yay!
dr_ross_geller Yay! Seriously, our sex life... I was thinking, maybe I don't know, we could try some-some new things. Y'know? For fun?
carol_willick Like what?
dr_ross_geller Well I don't know umm, what if we were too tie each other up? Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. Nah! Umm, y'know we-we could try dirty talk? Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.
carol_willick I love that idea!

monica_geller Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics!
joey_tribbiani Oh my God! That's great! Congratulations! What's the story?!
chandler_bing Oh you wouldn't uh, care. It's just a stupid comic book story.
joey_tribbiani Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!
chandler_bing Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn't want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist-as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can't have lumps in them.
joey_tribbiani Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? 'Cause I think I read it!
rachel_green Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls?
monica_geller Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot!
rachel_green Ohh! And I'm one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani!
monica_geller Well, y'know it's none of my business, but aren't you married?
rachel_green Yeah. Oh I just wish we could not be married for a little bit! Y'know I just wish we could be like on a break!
monica_geller Well, you're not.
rachel_green Oh, it's so easy for you I mean, you're not married, you get to have sex with who ever you want!

monica_geller It's not like, I haven't any opportunities. I mean, y'know, I'm just waiting for the perfect guy. I'm seeing this guy Roger, all right? He's not perfect, but umm, I think maybe I should just get it over with. Y'know, give him my flower.
rachel_green Oh my God!! Do it!! Honey, you've waited long enough!!
monica_geller Y'know what? You are right?!
rachel_green Yes!! I mean sex does not have to be a big deal! There shouldn't be all this rules and restrictions! Y'know, people should be able to sleep with who ever they want, whenever
monica_geller Rachel! I'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband!
rachel_green Oh what do you know? Virgin!
monica_geller Phoebe, why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?!
phoebe_buffay Oh yeah, the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.
